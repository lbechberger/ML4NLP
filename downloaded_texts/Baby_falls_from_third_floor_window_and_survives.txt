On Thursday, November 22, Thanksgiving Day, Bradley Priebe, a one-year-old baby boy fell from a third floor apartment window in New York City, New York. He has now been allowed to leave the hospital after staying overnight for observation. According to reports, the child sustained no serious injures from the fall and is in stable condition. 

Anna Priebe, the baby's mother says that it is "a miracle" that her son did not break any bones. Brandon, the father, says that the boy is doing "good. Everything's OK."

Bradley crawled out of the window and fell onto the roof of a Bronx music shop. The window was nearly 20 feet from the ground. The family thought the window was closed.

Police say that there is no reason to suspect that the incident is a criminal action, and no charges have been filed against the parents.
