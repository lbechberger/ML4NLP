In Fuerteventura, the Foreigner Internment Center 'La Matorral' was the scene of an incident on Tuesday evening. Five officers of the National Police sustained light injuries, as well as several immigrants. The riot started when a man tried to get a second dinner.

Only eight policemen were guarding the 1400 detained immigrants. Members of the Police Union attributed the incident to the recent increase in immigration from Africa to the Canary Isles. As a result, custody centres are overcrowded. Guards say there is a different atmosphere, since normally the centers are more tranquil and few guards are needed.
