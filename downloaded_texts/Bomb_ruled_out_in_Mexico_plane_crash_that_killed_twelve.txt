A bomb has been ruled out in the crash of a government-owned Learjet L45 in Mexico City, Mexico on Friday, killing all nine on board and five on the ground. There have been rumours that the crash was deliberate as two prominent politicians, interior minister Juan Camilo Mourino and leading anti-drug advisor Jose Luis Santiago Vasconcelos were aboard.

Investigators have also confirmed both engines were still functioning upon impact and that there was no fire, structural failure or evidence of malfunction prior to impact, suggesting a loss of control may be to blame. The aircraft should have been headed East towards Mexico City International Airport, but was instead travelling roughly Northbound when the crash occurred.

It is unknown why this occurred, but the investigation, which includes a team from the United States led by the National Transportation Safety Board, is looking at the possibility turbulence from another aircraft caused the plane to become uncontrollable. It was travelling at 300 mph (500 kph) when it struck cars moving through the city.

Investigation head Gilberto Lopez said of the findings "this clearly proves what we had believed, that there was an abrupt loss of control," while Transportation Secretary Luis Téllez said they “strengthen the hypothesis that this was an accident.”
