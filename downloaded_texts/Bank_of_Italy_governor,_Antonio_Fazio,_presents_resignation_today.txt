Bank of Italy Governor Antonio Fazio has resigned today, Monday December 19, after several months of crisis. He is suspected of malpractice concerning the takeover of the bank Banca Popolare Italiana. The European Central Bank has raised questions over allegations that Fazio accepted gifts from the Pop Italiana's former CEO, Gianpiero Fiorani. Fiorani, suspected of embezzlement, was arrested last week.

The news was welcomed by many Italian politics. The European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet said he "fully respected" Fazio's decision.
