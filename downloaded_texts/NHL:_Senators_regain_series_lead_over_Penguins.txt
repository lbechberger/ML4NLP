Senators lead series 2-1. (Best of Seven)





The Ottawa Senators defeated the Pittsburgh Penguins, Sunday evening, to take a 2-1 lead in the best-of-seven Easter Conference Series. The Senators kept finding holes around Pittsburgh goaltender Marc-Andre Fleury, scoring four times on 25 shots. Sidney Crosby became the first player to score in their first three NHL postseason games since 2001, but it wasn't enough to lift the Penguins to victory.

Gary Roberts, who scored in Saturday afternoon's game, got the Penguins off to an early lead, scoring just 52 seconds into regulation. That lead wouldn't hold up, however, as Dean McAmmond would knot it up at 18:04, when he would bury the puck behind Fleury. The Penguins struggled in the second period, as they have often as of late, allowing three more goals in the period. The Penguins offense kicked in in the third period, as Sidney Crosby would add a spectacular diving goal late in the game, but the Senators managed to weather the storm to emerge victorious.

The Penguins, despite being down in the series, will try to tie the series Tuesday night, when Mellon Arena will play host to the Ottawa Senators for game four of the best-of-seven series.
