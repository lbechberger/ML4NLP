The name of the British soldier killed in southern Afghanistan during a joint operation with Canadian-led NATO troops has been revealed by the Ministry of Defence to be Private Andrew Barrie Cutts, from the Royal Logistics Corps. Private Cults was killed in the Musah Qualeh area of northern Helmand.

Pte Cutts, who was killed yesterday during a planned operation against insurgents, was part of the 13 Air Assault Support Regiment. Since May, ten British soldiers have been killed in Afghanistan. 

Defence Secretary, Des Browne, said yesterday, “I was saddened to hear of the death today of a British soldier who was supporting the NATO mission in Afghanistan. This is a huge loss for his friends and family - my thoughts are with them. UK forces are making a vital contribution to bringing security to the people of Afghanistan. Today's tragic incident underlines the challenges they face in carrying out this important task.” 

Yesterday, commandos told the Sunday Telegraph British troops in Afghanistan are on “the brink of exhaustion”. But Chief of the General Staff, General Sir Mike Jackson, who retires at the end of this month, yesterday defended Britain’s military strategy in Afghanistan.
