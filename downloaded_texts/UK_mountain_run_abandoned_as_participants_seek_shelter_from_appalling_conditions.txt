A fell running event, the Original Mountain Marathon, has been abandoned under appalling weather conditions,
which left a number of competitors stranded.

The event's abandonment was confirmed (according to web reports) at midday by race director Jen Longbottom.

The disruption of the event that occurred at the top of one of the highest mountains in the Borrowdale Valley
(a region of the UK's Lake District) left hundreds of runners stranded due to flooding.


The runners were taking part in the Original Mountain Marathon (OMM), until flooding and heavy rain forced them to stop. Around three hundred people were forced to take shelter at the nearby Honister Slate Mine.

"The weather is absolutely horrendous and it's a scene of chaos up here," stated Mark Weir, the owner of the slate mine. "I believe there were up to about two thousand people who entered this race and I advised the organizers not to go ahead with the event."

"The mountain rescue teams are still trying to account for everyone," added Weir. "We have had people coming in throughout the day in pretty bad states. They are dripping wet through and very cold. Our staff are helping to transport them off the mountain pass and down to Cockermouth where the emergency services are taking over. But we need more help and more buses as there are still plenty of people up here."

12 people have suffered from hypothermia, and one of them has been taken to the nearby Cumberland Infirmary Hospital for treatment.
