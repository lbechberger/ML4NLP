Eva Avila, 19, of Gatineau, Quebec was crowned this years winner of Canadian Idol. Craig Sharpe, 16, of Upper Island Cove, Newfoundland and Labrador was the runner up.

The show was aired in the Air Canada Centre in Toronto and lasted two hours.

Former Canadian Idol winner Melissa O'Neil sang her new hit single Speechless. O'Neil was presented with a multi-platinum record for her single Alive by Craig Sharpe earlier in the show. Eva Avila also gave her a muti-platinum record for her self-titled album Melissa O'Neil. Nelly Furtado sang her new hit single Maneater from her new album Loose. The African Children's Choir also sang on stage with this years Top 10.

Newfoundland and Labrador Premier Danny Williams and St. John's MP Loyola Hearn were in the audience to lend their support for Craig.

Avila won by approximately 131,000 votes, a margin of just over three per cent of the four million votes cast in the final.

"I'm just one tiny person on this planet but thanks to you guys, I'm feeling like I'm sitting on top of the world," Avila said Sunday.

Avila sang what will be the first single of her upcoming album: Meant to Fly, co-written by Chantal Kreviazuk and her husband Raine Maida. Sony BMG Music Canada is the record label that will be releasing her single on September 26. Her new recording was on the radio airwaves at 12 am. today.

"The fact that all Canada is voting and the votes were so close ... I'm happy that she won," he said. "I mean, I'm sad that I lost, but we are different and she's just amazing," Craig Sharpe said.

Canadian Idol host Ben Mulroney announced Sunday that Cyndi Lauper has agreed to produce one track for Avila's future album. Country singer Martina McBride has invited Avila to join her on her Canadian tour in summer 2007.
