The Pakistan government has formally launched the country’s first policy on renewable sources of energy. The policy offers attractive incentives to investors willing to exploit this environment-friendly but largely unexplored sector especially for power generation. The ‘Policy for Development of Renewable Energy for Power Generation – 2006’ has already been approved by the Economic Coordination Committee of the Cabinet.
