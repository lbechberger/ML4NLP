Retired Formula 1 driver Michael Schumacher has called off his return due to a neck injury. The German Ferrari driver announced his decision not to participate on his website. He said "Unfortunately we did not manage to get a grip on the pain in the neck which occurred after the private F1-day in Mugello."



Schumacher who injured his neck in a bike accident in February aggravated his injury whilst trying out a 2007 F1 car as he was preparing for his comeback. The bike accident caused fractures in the area of head and neck which eventually turned out to be too severe for Formula 1 racing according to Schumacher. 

Ferrari President Luca di Montezemolo said. "I'm very sorry about the problem that will stop Michael returning to racing. His return would surely have done Formula 1 good and I'm certain we'd have seen him fighting for victory again." 

Schumacher who retired in 2006 after winning the Formula 1 championship seven times, was due to replace the injured Felipe Massa. The Brazilian suffered a serious head injury after a crash during the 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix. Massa is due to be out for at least the rest of the 2009 season. 

Test driver Luca Badoer is now due to replace Massa. Badoer competed in Formula 1 between 1993 and 1999. He holds the record for the most Formula 1 starts without scoring a single point at 49 starts.
