Osama bin Laden has appeared in a new but undated video praising martyrdom. "The happy (person) is the one chosen by Allah to be a martyr," he could be seen saying.

The video had the insignia of the As-Sahab group, considered the media production house of Al-Qaeda. The background looked similar to that of older videos, known to have been filmed in Afghanistan.

The video, entitled "Winds of Paradise", features speeches by five suicide bombers and Al-Qaeda leadership. SITE Institute, a non-profit organization which tracks the online activity of terrorist organizations, said that the footage was old, but did not give an estimated date.
