Former Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi has been killed after heavy fighting in his home town of Sirte.

Libyan television today announced that former Libyan ruler Muammar Gaddafi was killed by revolutionary forces in Sirte following weeks of brutal fighting. 

The Libyan Prime minister said Gaddafi was captured unharmed by National Transitional Council forces but was shot in the head during crossfire with Gaddafi loyalists, and died soon after. There are various other, conflicting reports on Gaddafi's cause of death.

The National Transitional Council Information Minister Mahmoud Shammam has said that the death of Gaddafi was "a great victory for the Libyan people" and that "Colonel Gaddafi is history".

A picture of a wounded man taken from a mobile phone was released shortly after the news of his capture broke, although it could not be independently verified whether the man was indeed Gaddafi.
