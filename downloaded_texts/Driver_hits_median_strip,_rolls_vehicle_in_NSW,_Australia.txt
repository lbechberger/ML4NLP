A driver in the New South Wales city of Bathurst, West of Sydney has had a lucky escape after rolling his vehicle onto its side and narrowly avoiding other vehicles.

The accident occurred shortly before 9 a.m. AEST today when a small Sports Utility Vehicle sped out of Gilmour Street, Kelso onto the Great Western Highway before attempting to turn into Lee Street. Witnesses told Wikinews that the car hit the median strip, spun and then rolled onto its side.

Michael Reynard, a witness to the accident told Wikinews it was amazing that only a single vehicle was involved. "The road is busy at this time of day, he only just missed cars on the other side of the road," said Mr Reynard.

"He came flying around the corner, hit the median strip and just lost it. The next thing you know, he was on his side," recalled Mr Reynard.

Nobody was injured in the accident.
