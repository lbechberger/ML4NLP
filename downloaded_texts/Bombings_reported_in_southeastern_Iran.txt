Three separate explosions have been reported in Zahedan, a city in southeast Iran near the Afghan and Pakistani borders. Reports indicate that the bombings gave minor injuries to three people and caused some damage to houses. One of the blasts reportedly occurred at approximately 4:30 am, with the other two preceding shortly before.

The attack is part of a series of bombings that have occurred shortly before the Iranian presidential election. Blasts in Tehran and the southwestern city of Ahvaz on Sunday killed a total of 10 people. Despite these grave attacks, Iranian officials are asserting that the turnout for the election will not be impaired. At a Monday press conference, intelligence minister Ali Younessi said, ""[The] Sunday morning and evening [attacks] in Ahvaz and Tehran are not going to have any effect on people's presence at presidential election polls."
