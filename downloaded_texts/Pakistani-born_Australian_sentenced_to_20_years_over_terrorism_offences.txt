Convicted terrorist Faheem Khalid Lodhi has been sentenced a 20 years prison time by the Supreme Court of New South Wales, Australia. 

Lodhi, a 36 year old Pakistani immigrant to Australia, was earlier in June convicted on three counts of terrorist related charges, planning to attack civilian targets and military installations. Justice Anthony Whealy commented at the court hearings that Lodhi had "the intent of advancing a political, religious or ideological cause, namely violent jihad". 

Lodhi is the first person to be convicted under a new set of strict anti-terrorism laws enacted by the Australian Government in 2005 and the first person convicted of terrorist activities inside Australia.

Lodhi, who maintains his innocence, will be eligible for parole in 2019.
