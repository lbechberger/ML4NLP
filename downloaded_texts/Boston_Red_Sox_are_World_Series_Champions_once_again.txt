For the second time in four years, the Boston Red Sox have won the World Series Championship sweeping the Colorado Rockies in four games. They won the deciding game 4 on Sunday night, 4-3. 

The Rockies, who went nearly undefeated in their final 21 games with just one loss and claimed the National League wildcard, seemed poised to put up a fight in the series after sweeping the Philadelphia Phillies in the NLDS, 3-0 and the Arizona Diamondbacks, 4-0 in the NLCS, and enjoying eight days of rest after beating the Diamondbacks.

However, the Red Sox dominated the series from the outset. They earned their place in the series after coming back from a three games to one deficit against the Cleveland Indians in the ALCS. They managed to win their second World Series title in four years, after their nearly historic comeback in 2004 in which they won their first championship in 86 years and ended the "Curse of the Bambino".

Mike Lowell received the World Series MVP Award which included a hybrid Chevy Malibu and a hybrid Chevy Tahoe. It is currently unknown at the moment if Lowell will resign as he has attained free agent status now that the season is over.
