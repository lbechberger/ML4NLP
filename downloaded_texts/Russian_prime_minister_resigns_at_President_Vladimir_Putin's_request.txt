Prime Minister of Russia Mikhail Fradkov has resigned, citing his reason as being "the approaching major political events in the country and a desire to give the president full freedom in making decisions, including personnel." Russian President Vladimir Putin has nominated Victor Zubkov to replace him, and a new cabinet is expected to follow as well.

Parliamentary elections are expected to take place in three months as the parliament has not been dissolved, and presidential elections will take place in six months.
