At least five people have been killed, and several others injured, after a Cessna 310 crashed into a neighborhood in Sanford, Florida, in the United States. Two people on the plane and three others on the ground were reported to be killed in the crash.

The plane was attempting to make an emergency landing at the Orlando-Sanford International Airport when it crashed into two houses, causing a massive fire. The aircraft is registered to Competitor Liaison Bureau Inc. of Daytona Beach, and is linked to NASCAR's late chairman. The plane was traveling from Daytona Beach to Lakeland in Florida when the pilot declared smoke in the cockpit, and attempted an emergency landing.

The 310 is a twin-engine plane that is often used for air taxi services, and for personal use. It seats six people, including the pilot.
