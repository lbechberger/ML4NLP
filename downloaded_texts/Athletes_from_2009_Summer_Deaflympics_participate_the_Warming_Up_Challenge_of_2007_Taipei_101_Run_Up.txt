Prior to 2007 Taipei 101 Run Up, organizers held a 35-floors warming up match for local athletes from 2009 Summer Deaflympics with the theme of "Value Your Every Step". This warming up simulated every possible situation as athletes wore the RFID chip and some professional medical teams stood by for emergency.

"Taipei City and 2009 Summer Deaflympics (in the future) will be known with a conjunction from this game (Taipei 101 Run Up) and the promotion of 2009 Summer Deaflympics." Emile Sheng (Chief Executive Director of 2009 Summer Deaflympics) remarked before this match, "We (Taipei City Government, the organizer of 2009 Deaflympics) will provide the best service for athletes from participated nations to do an effective promotion of the deaf culture in Taiwan."

"The deaf culture in Taiwan was rarely respected by common people. After Taipei City was elected to be the organizer of the 2009 Deaflympics, and a success of '2007 World Deaf Swimming Championship', this (deaf) culture is now progressively respected around the world. I hope this game can be a great platform to make this known by more and more people with deaf athletes' participation." Sue Wang (Spokeswoman of 2007 Taipei Run Up and Sign Language Anchor of Public Television Service) remarked.

Hsiao-hua Tseng and Lan-feng Chen, men's and women's fastest athlete in this (warming up) match, finished separately with 6 min 9 secs and 6 min 45 secs. After this match, the host (Taipei 101) awarded certifications and announced that the main match will take place next Sunday (November 25) morning.
