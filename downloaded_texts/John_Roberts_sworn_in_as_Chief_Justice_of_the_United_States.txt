John G. Roberts Jr. was sworn in as the 17th Chief Justice of the United States on Thursday, September 29, 2005, hours after being confirmed by the United States Senate by a 78-22 vote. The oath of office was administered by Justice John Paul Stevens, who has served as acting chief justice since the death of William Rehnquist.

President George Bush commented "The Senate has confirmed a man with an astute mind and kind heart. All Americans can be confident that the 17th chief justice of the United States will be prudent in exercising judicial power, firm in defending judicial independence and above all a faithful guardian of the Constitution."

Roberts gained support from all Republicans and half the Democrats in the Senate. 

Now President Bush can turn his attention to the next nominee to replace Sandra Day O'Connor, the position Roberts was slated originally to fill. Many experts say this nomination will be a much more contentious once compared to Robert's. O'Connor tended to be the key vote when it came to Woman's Rights, Affirmative Action and abortion.
