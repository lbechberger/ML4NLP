The Sudanese president Omar al-Bashir has issued a full pardon to British school teacher Gillian Gibbons who was sentenced to 15 days in jail after allowing children in her class to name a teddy bear "Muhammad".

The decision came after a meeting with two members of a British Muslim group, Lord Ahmed and Baroness Warsi who travelled to the Sudan after her imprisonment around a week ago. The imprisonment of the 54 year-old teacher from Liverpool caused international outcry with Muslims in Sudan protesting for her death, and British Muslims protesting for her release.

British Prime Minister Gordon Brown said he was "delighted and relieved" at the decision and Mrs Gibbons said "I am sorry if I caused any distress" in a released statement. Mrs Gibbons is expected to be released into the custody of the British embassy in the Sudan.
