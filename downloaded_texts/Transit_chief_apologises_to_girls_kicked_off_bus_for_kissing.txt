An Oregon transit agency chief apologized Thursday to two 14-year old girls who had been ejected for kissing on a Portland bus.

"Removing the girls from the bus was not consistent with our policy," said TriMet General Manager Fred Hansen. "I want to reiterate that we welcome all riders on our system."

The 64-year old driver, an eleven year veteran, will be disciplined. The girls complained that the driver had called them "sickos" before stopping the bus and forcing them off.

"TriMet sincerely apologizes to the girls and their families for this incident," Hansen said in the statement.
