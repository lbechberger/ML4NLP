Mark Webber gained his maiden Formula 1 win today at the German Grand Prix, after 130 races. His Red Bull teammate Sebastian Vettel came in second, with Ferrari's Felipe Massa third. Reigning champion Lewis Hamilton came last.

Webber started from pole position, but touched Rubens Barrichello at the beginning after a slow start. He received a drive through penalty for this offence, which he served at the end of his fourteenth lap. This enabled him to join back in to the race in first place.

Jenson Button remains first in the championship with 68 points, with Vettel and Webber overtaking Barrichello, taking second and third respectively.

After the win, Webber said "I lost Rubens off the start, I thought he had gone to the left but he went right and I banged into him. I had a drive-through and my engineer kept me calm. It was a difficult winter, Sebastian showed in winter testing what the car could do, so I kept my motivation high and I was hurting a lot. The team had patience with me, everyone in Australia and a few people who doubted me too so hello to them as well. So thank you to everyone who helped me here."
