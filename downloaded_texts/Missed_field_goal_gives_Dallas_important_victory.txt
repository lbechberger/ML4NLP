The Dallas Cowboys beat the Kansas City Chiefs 31-28 at Texas Stadium in Irving, Texas.

It was a thrilling game which was decided in the final seconds when Lawrence Tynes missed a 41-yard field goal which would have forced overtime.

Cowboys quarterback Drew Bledsoe passed for a season-best 332 yards, including a 71-yard touchdown pass to Terry Glenn in the second quarter, and a 14-play 68-yard drive in the fourth for the winning touchdown.

"That was really a great drive, probably the best one of the year," said Dallas coach Bill Parcells.

The win means the Cowboys remain tied with the Minnesota Vikings, who won against the St. Louis Rams, for the sixth and final NFC wildcard spot with 3 games remaining. The Chiefs are now in a three-way tie for the sixth AFC wildcard spot with the San Diego Chargers, who lost to the Miami Dolphins, and the Cincinnati Bengals, who won against the Cleveland Browns.

The Chiefs face the New York Giants next Saturday and the Cowboys play the Washington Redskins on Sunday.
