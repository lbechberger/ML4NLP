Greg Abbott was sworn in on Tuesday as the first new governor for the state of Texas in fourteen years. Abbott replaces Rick Perry, who was elected in three consecutive elections as the state's Governor. Although Perry was not, Abbott is an attorney and recently served as the state's Attorney General.

During his inauguration speech, Abbott spoke about the issue of border security in the state by saying, "We must do more for the millions of Texans who are tired of seeing our state sovereignty and the rule of law ignored by a federal government that refuses to secure our border". Abbott in his speech did not address recent drops in state revenue tied to declining oil and gas prices.

Although the state has over a US$1 trillion per-year economy, some economists suggest tough times may be on the horizon as energy prices slump. Fundraising of over US$4.5 million supported the inaugural celebration in the state capital of Austin, including a parade. Abbott is the first Governor in the US to routinely use a wheelchair since George Wallace, former governor of Alabama.
