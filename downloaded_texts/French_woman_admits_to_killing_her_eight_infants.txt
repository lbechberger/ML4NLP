French prosecutors confirmed on Thursday that nursing assistant Dominique Cottrez killed her eight newborn infants and buried their remains. Prosecutors called the case "non-standard... given the large number of newborns."

According to prosecutors, Cottrez, in her 40s, is heavy-set and she was able to hide her eight pregnancies. Cottrez did not want to visit a doctor for contraceptives nor did she want more children.

Cottrez admitted to strangling eight infants and hiding the remains in garbage bags. The killings occurred over a time span of several years, from 1989 to 2006 or 2007. Prosecutors charged her with "deliberate homicides of minors under the age of 15," which could cause Cottrez to serve a life sentence in prison.

New homeowners of the Cottrez's former house discovered bags with the remains of two infants. Investigators discovered an additional six children in the Cottrez's house in Villers-au-Tertre.

Cottrez's husband, Pierre-Marie Cottrez, was unaware of the killings.
