At a news conference intended to be on the Conservatives' childcare policies, Michael Howard's decision to sack Conservative MP Howard Flight has continued to dominate as the ex-Tory deputy chairman's expulsion from the party was the subject of every question.

The affair began when the MP for Arundel and South Downs was recorded as saying that the conservatives' spending cuts of Â£35bn would 'only be the start' under a Tory Government. This issue has been of particular significance in the run-up to the expected General election on May 5th.

Mr. Flight has resisted his removal from the candidate list, insisting it is the prerogative of the local party members only and not head office. He has taken legal advice as to summoning an emergency general meeting of Arundel and South Downs Conservative Association.

Howard Flight has insisted that he would not stand as an independent candidate.
