U.S. President George W. Bush on Tuesday named Tony Snow, a former news anchor and talk show host for the Fox News network, as his new press secretary.

Bush said in a press conference, "I'm confident Tony Snow will make an outstanding addition to this White House staff. I am confident he will help you do your job. My job is to make decisions, and his job is to help explain those decisions to the press corps and the American people."

Snow said in response, "These are times that are going to be very challenging. We've got a lot of big issues ahead, and we've got a lot of important things that all of us are going to be covering together, and I'm very excited and I can't wait."

Snow, 50, replaces Scott McClellan, who submitted his resignation last week.

Before joining Fox News in 1996, Snow was a speechwriter for Bush's father, former President George H.W. Bush. At Fox News, Snow was a weekend news anchor and host of "The Tony Snow Show" on Fox News Radio. He was also a nationally syndicated columnist for the Detroit News from 1993 to 2001.
