An airspace intrusion alarm near the White House put the White House on alert Wednesday. The warning was later revealed as a false alarm due to a technical problem. Secret Service agents rushed the President from the Oval Office into an underground shelter. The Vice President was taken to a secure zone. Some of the White House staff and visitors were also moved to safety.

In a short time it was shown to be a false alarm. Aircraft were called in to check and patrol the air space around the White House.

White House press secretary Scott McClellan announced that the President reached the shelter quickly, to demonstrate that the President is constantly in a safe environment.

In Prince George County, Virginia, two unusually low-flying jets, presumably fighters, were heard approaching from the south. They screamed northward in the direction of Washington D.C. at approximately 12:00 EDT (16:00 UTC). The over-flights were ungrouped; the second plane followed the first by about a minute.
