Liverpool-based football club Liverpool F.C. (LFC) appointed German Jürgen Klopp as the club's new manager. Klopp signed a three-year contract with LFC for GBP £15 million, with annual earnings of £5 million and an increment to £7 million if the club wins the Premier League or if the club qualifies for the UEFA Champions League.



Klopp's predecessor, Brendan Rodgers, was fired on Sunday after three-and-half-years of service at Anfield. 

Liverpool were at 10th position in the League table and drew 1–1 against local rivals Everton.

Klopp previously served as the manager at German football club Borussia Dortmund (BVB) and won the German Bundesliga with them twice. Klopp held the position of Dortmund manager until May 2015, and his last match was against Wolfsburg in the DFB Pokal cup.

This signing made Klopp the highest-paid manager in Liverpool history. His first match in the Premier League will be against Tottenham Hotspur on October 17. Liverpool have only had four wins out of eleven league games this season.

In response to this signing, Borussia Dortmund tweeted "We heard the news today, oh boy! All the best at the Kop, Jürgen Klopp!"
