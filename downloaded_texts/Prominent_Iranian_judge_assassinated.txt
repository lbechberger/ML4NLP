Investigations continued Thursday after a prominent Iranian judge, Hassan Moghaddas, was assassinated in the middle of his evening commute Tuesday evening. Iranian police have so far attributed the killing to "...some mad gesture or a settling of accounts."

Judge Moghaddas presided over several controversial cases in his career, including the sentencing of Iranian reporter Akbar Ganji and was also unsuccessfully subpoenaed to testify in an investigation into the death of Canadian-Iranian reporter Zahra Kazemi.
