The Football Association (FA) charged English Premier League side Chelsea on Tuesday for "failing to ensure their players conducted themselves in an orderly fashion" in the league game against QPR on Sunday, October 23.

The match, which Chelsea lost 1–0, saw both defender José Bosingwa and striker Didier Drogba receive straight red cards for reckless challenges before half-time. Seven other players were cautioned through the course of the game. The charge relates to the players' reaction to the decision to send off Bosingwa.

The FA have also requested to approach Chelsea manager Andre Villas-Boas regarding criticisms made of referee Chris Foy in post-match media interviews; if found guilty he faces a touchline ban or personal fine. Villas-Boas said Foy's decisions were "very poor" and that he felt these influenced the result of the game.



Speaking to the BBC, he expressed no remorse for his words: "Of course the FA want to speak to me regarding things I said after the game, but I will reiterate once again that the same criteria was not applied for both teams. [...] If you take one rule you have to stick to it for the rest of the game to show that you have a pattern in what you are doing, and I have full evidence now that wasn't the case. It is a game refereed by humans and human mistakes were present."

After the same game, Chelsea captain John Terry was accused of racially abusing QPR defender Anton Ferdinand after videos of the two arguing circulated on sharing site YouTube in which Terry appears to use slurs. The incident is being investigated by both QPR themselves and the Metropolitan Police.
