On Wednesday, NASCAR driver Jimmie Johnson was named the 2010 Driver of the Year. Anyone who competes in a vehicle with four wheels in the United States is eligible to win the award. By doing so, he tied his Hendrick Motorsports team mate Jeff Gordon with four, the most in its 44 year history.

Johnson won the award with 10 votes, three more than NHRA driver John Force. Fellow NASCAR driver, Kyle Busch only received one vote. Johnson, who also won the award in 2006, 2007, and 2009, commented, "It's an honor to win the award again. Among such tough competition, with the voting panel, who it is and how well versed they are in motorsports, it's a huge, huge honor." Johnson was told he was the winner during the NASCAR Awards Banquet held in Las Vegas, Nevada.

Barry Schmoyer, president of the award panel, said, "This year's pre-vote teleconference was one of the most spirited debates that I can recall. As many people have said already, it will be a long time before anyone will set the bar as high as Jimmie Johnson." The trophy and a Tissot wristwatch are some of the items he will receive as the winner. The place and time where they will be presented will be announced at a later date.
