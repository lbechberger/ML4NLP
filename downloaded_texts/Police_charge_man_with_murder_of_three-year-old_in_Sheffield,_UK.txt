In the United Kingdom, South Yorkshire Police have charged a 30-year-old man with murder over the death of a 3-year-old girl in the city of Sheffield. The man, who has been identified as Delroy Catwell by Sheffield newspaper The Star, was charged yesterday evening and appeared today at Sheffield Magistrates’ Court.

In the Shiregreen district of Sheffield, where Catwell also resides, the girl was transported by ambulance to Sheffield Children’s Hospital Friday night. Her death in the hospital occurred at approximately 0020 UTC Saturday.

Sioned-Mair Richards of Sheffield City Council said "[i]t is a tragedy to lose a child at any age". The Shiregreen councillor described the district as "the kind of community where everyone knows each other," adding: "I am sure everyone will offer lots of support." Peter Rippon, also a Shiregreen councillor, described local residents as "shocked and saddened". He also said "[t]he whole community’s thoughts will be with this little girl’s family today."

During the weekend, officers questioned nearby residents about any suspicious activity they had witnessed recently. The house the child was picked up from remains cordoned off and is currently being guarded by police.
