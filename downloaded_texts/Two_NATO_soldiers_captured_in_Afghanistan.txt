The International Security Assistance Force (ISAF), the NATO forces organization in Afghanistan, has announced two forces members have failed to return from a vehicle patrol to their Kabul City compound.

ISAF did not report the nationalities of the missing soldiers, but US officials have confirmed to the Associated Press the soldiers are United States military.

Sky News is reporting a Taliban spokesperson as saying three soldiers were captured, but one has since died.

A ground and air search is being conducted for the missing troops, who are believed to be in Logar province.

In June 2009 Pfc Bowe Bergdahl was captured by Taliban forces in Paktika province. His whereabouts are still unknown, though the Taliban have released three videos of him, most recently in April 2010.
