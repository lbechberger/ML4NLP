Colombia and Venezuela continue to clash over the circumstances of the announced arrest of Rodrigo Granda, alleged leader of the FARC.
Colombia released a list of terrorists harbored by Venezuela and a recording of a conversation between alleged members of the FARC. Venezuela said it will request the extradition of terrorists in Colombia. In Caracas a march was scheduled by thousands of activists supporting the President of Venezuela Hugo Chavez and protesting against the USA. President Chavez appeared on television to accuse the USA of being behind the Colombian accusations. The head of the Colombian Police was traveling in a helicopter when it came under attack by forces of the FARC.

Colombia is supported by the USA in opposing the FARC who are believed to be involved in international drug trade. Venezuela is allegedly supported by the Foro de SÃ£o Paulo as member states, along with Brazil, Cuba and the FARC.
