From Washington D.C. to New York City, trains powered by overhead electric lines stalled for more than two hours due to what Amtrak called a "major power outage." While working to restore power, Amtrak attempted to provide alternative transportation in the form of diesel locomotives and buses. Power was restored at 10:30 a.m. EDT. Delays continued for much of the day. 

Besides long-distance rail services such as Acela, local commuter trains were affected. Seven SEPTA lines in the Philadelphia area were temporarily shut down, and five more ran shortened routes. Also affected was Maryland's MARC and New Jersey Transit.

No specific cause has been reported, but Amtrak's site indicates that they are investigating.
