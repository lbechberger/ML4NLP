A nine-hour standoff between Police and a man who threatened to blow up gas tanks in his house came to an end when a SWAT team used tear gas to subdue the man, late Saturday night in Lakewood, Ohio.

The situation started at 2:30 p.m. on Saturday, January 20 when emergency medical service crews were called to the home of Jason Pollack, 31. He became despondent after his family called for Emergency medical services to take him to the hospital for psychological testing. 

Police backup was called up after Pollack became hostile. When the officers arrived, they said the man threatened to blow up several propane and oxygen tanks in the house. Police retreated, leaving the man in his house. The man refused to come out, leading to the standoff. 

Westshore SWAT was deployed at 6 p.m. Because of the high risk of explosion, they sent in a camera and PA-equipped robot, attempting to open a dialogue with the man, with little results. Just before midnight, according to SWAT radio, officers sent tear gas into the home, which forced the man to the front door, opening and slamming shut, as if to taunt the officers. They sent more tear gas into the home, forcing the man onto the porch. Officers quickly swarmed him and took him into custody.

Earlier in the day, at 6:30 p.m., Police &amp; Fire services evacuated approximately 150 homes nearby as a precautionary measure and CERT was deployed. Residents were offered shelter at Lakewood High School, where the Red Cross provided food, cots, and coffee. Over 50 residents were still at the shelter as of Sunday morning.

Police say no one was injured in the standoff, and they're working with the Prosecutor to determine what charges will be filed against Pollack.
