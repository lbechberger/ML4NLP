Denny Hamlin followed Truex in seventh, while Dale Earnhardt, Jr. could only manage eighth.

Kurt Busch, and Brian Vickers rounded out the top ten finishers in the race. After doing his victory lap, Edwards commented, "It means a lot coming off of Phoenix. I went home last week and I had no clue, I just didn't know how things were going to go from there. You don't get a good race car like that very often, but we had another one today." Afterward, Stewart described his frustration by finishing second, "We had the fastest thing on the planet today and we just gave it away. It kills me to throw away a race like that."
