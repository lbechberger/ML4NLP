Caloundra have won the limited overs cricket final on Australia's Sunshine Coast. They defeated Glasshouse by 90 runs.

"It's good to win the one day final but at the end of the day the two day final is what wen want," said Caloundra captin Rod Gibson.

Glasshouse won the toss and elected to field. They managed to get Caloundra two out for twenty four runs. Fifties from Chris Howe (55) and Dale Nissan (54), as well as 41 from Matt Jenkins, helped Caloundra score a further 183 runs, getting them to a score of five out for 207. The innings ended at 226 all out.

The Glasshouse top order falled to fire with only Bret Milini (42) scoring more than 20 runs. The teams eighth batsman, Anthony Delfornso, managed to score 23 before being caught by Jankins. Caloundra bowled 20 sundries (no balls, wides etc) which only proped up what would have been a reletivly low score for a game of cricket played at 50 overs a side.

Caloundra won the right to host the final by finishing on top of the limited overs ladder with six wins and a draw. Glasshouse finshed second on the ladder with five wins, one loss and one draw.
