The Red Cross movement admitted the Israeli national emergency and medical relief service, the Magen David Adom (MDA), after a 58 year wait, despite objections by some Muslim member countries.

The Red Crystal emblem, into which the Star of David may be placed, made it possible for Israel's MDA to join the humanitarian network — which makes up the world's largest relief agency — after decades of isolation.

The decision had met with resistance from some Muslim countries opposing the Israeli group's admission, including representatives of the Organisation of the Islamic Conference, as well as Pakistan and Tunisia delegates.
