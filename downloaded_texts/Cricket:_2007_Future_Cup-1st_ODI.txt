In the 2007 Future Cup, South Africa beat India in the first One-Day International (ODI) held at the Civil Service Cricket Club Ground, Belfast, Ireland. After South Africa won the toss and chose to field first, Sachin Tendulkar and Sourav Ganguly opened India's innings. Ganguly left quickly and Gautam Gambhir left without troubling the scorers. However, Tendulkar found some long term company with Rahul Dravid and pushed the score to 194/2 before Dravid left on 74. It wasn't long before Tendulkar himself found himself runout by Morne van Wyk/Mark Boucher for 99 with the score on 211. A batting collapse ensued and at the end of the innings, India's score was 242/8. South Africa's reply started with a steady opening partnership of AB de Villiers and Morne van Wyk which added 56 before de Villiers departed with a catch to the keeper. Jacques Kallis then came in and scored 91. Even though partnerships didn't last long, Kallis battled secured India's fate.
