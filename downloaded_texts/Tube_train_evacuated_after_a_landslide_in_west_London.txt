Six hundred Tube passengers had to be moved to safety in west London tonight after a landslide close to a station on the London Underground. 

Commuters on board an eastbound Piccadilly Line train at Boston Manor Station were evacuated after around four tonnes of debris landed on the tracks. The train collided with the rubble, but London Underground said the train stayed on the tracks. There are no reports of any injuries. Due to inspections of damage caused, the Piccadilly Line has been suspended between Northfields and Heathrow. London Underground said all of the train's passengers were led off onto the platform at Boston Manor within 15 minutes. 

A spokeswoman said: "London Underground is currently assessing the impact of an embankment landslip between Boston Manor and Northfields. Initial indications are that three to four tonnes of debris has ended up on the track. An eastbound Piccadilly Line train came into contact with the debris at Boston Manor station." 

A replacement bus service is operating between Northfields and Heathrow. Tube tickets can also be used on Heathrow Connect rail services from Ealing Broadway. 

Staff at London Underground are trying to clear the debris overnight in the hope of resuming service on the line on Friday morning.
