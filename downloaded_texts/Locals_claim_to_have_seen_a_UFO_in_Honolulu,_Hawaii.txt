Locals said they saw UFOs in the sky over Honolulu, Hawaii at 6:20 p.m. The KHON 2 television station was able to catch the objects in the sky using their SkyCam. The National Weather Service said that no objects appeared on their radar at the time the objects were witnessed. The Federal Aviation Administration said that they also did not pick up anything unusual on their radars.

The U.S. military had conducted a missile defense test off of Kauai on the same day, but the event did not start until 7:20 p.m.

According to KHON 2 news, Peter Hollingworth, a resident of Honolulu, described the objects as two circling lights about 45 degrees above the horizon. Hollingworth, who was surfing with his son when the objects appeared, said that, "These two little fireballs with a stream behind it. Looked kind of like a shooting star but it just kept going. They changed directions a few times, at first it was coming in then it turned, then it went out then it came back in again. I was a little concerned. I told him come over and sit with me - this might be the last surf session we ever have together because this thing's coming straight for Honolulu. It looked deadly to me it was kind of spooky.”

Astronomy professor Gareth Wynn-Williams, from the University of Hawaii, told KHON 2 news, "It's probably a contrail of some kind. The air is very cold so the water condenses and forms like drops very quickly and then these drops stay behind the plane until eventually they warm up and they evaporate.”
