In the past two days, at least two rockets fired from Syria have landed in northern Israel, according to the Israeli military. Both rockets landed in the Golan Heights neighborhood of Israel, which shares its border with Syria. At least two mortar shells also hit the same area yesterday.

No damage to buildings was reported and no one was injured in any of the incidents. Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) believe that the rockets and mortars were strays intended for "villages inside Syria and are part of the ongoing internal conflict."

An official of the Syrian government denies knowledge of fighting with rebels so close to the Israeli border and says "the Syrian army does not fire rockets against the rebels."

Earlier this year, Wikinews reported the Syrian army fired several rockets or mortar shells at residences, near the position of a citizen journalist in Homs, Syria. The attack injured or killed an unknown number of civilians and badly damaged several homes.

The IDF has filed a formal complaint about the incidents of the past two days with the United Nations.
