Pakistani police said today that a suicide bomber in a rickshaw has killed three people in Peshawar, a day after another suicide bomber killed thirteen people in a crowded market outside the northwestern city.

Police say the suicide bomber detonated his explosives at a checkpoint on a frequently traveled road that runs around Peshawar. Officials say a constable, a passerby, and the rickshaw driver were among the dead. The blast wounded five other people.

According to a senior local police officer, the attacker was probably intending to detonate the bomb in a more crowded area, but decided to set it off when security officials stopped the rickshaw in order to check it.

"The bomber was in a rickshaw and detonated his explosives when the rickshaw was stopped for a check," said police official Zafar Khan. "One of our constables, a passerby and the rickshaw driver were killed."

Local government official Sahibzada Anis said that "despite all the security arrangements you cannot stop one who is bent upon killing himself and others. Our police are rendering their lives to save citizens but these kinds of incidents are hard to stop."

No person or group has yet claimed responsibility for the attack.
