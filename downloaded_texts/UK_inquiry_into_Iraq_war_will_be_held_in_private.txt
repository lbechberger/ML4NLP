United Kingdom Prime Minister Gordon Brown announced today that the independent inquiry into the Iraq War will be held in private. It has been called for by opposition MP's and Labour MP's since the invasion and it was announced today that it will start next month.

It is planned to take at least a year, according to Mr. Brown, and is being held in private for national security matters and to protect Britain's military capability.

Protestors have reacted angrily to the news, believing the government will try to hide blame.
