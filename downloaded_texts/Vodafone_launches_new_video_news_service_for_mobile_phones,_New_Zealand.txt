Customers of Vodafone 3G in New Zealand are now able to watch live video news bulletins on their mobiles. This service, offered in corporation with the Prime channel, part of the Sky News network, replaces a service just offering news clips. 

To access the live bulletin, a 3G handset is required and the phone needs to be in a 3G coverage area. At 5:30PM the Sky News streamed channel will automatically broadcast Prime's 'First at 5.30' show until 6PM. To watch the 'live!' mobile tv channels, customers must either pay a flat fee of $2.99 a week for unlimited access, or pay 99 cents for a one-off session lasting fifteen minutes.
