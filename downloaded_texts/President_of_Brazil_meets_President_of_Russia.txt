The president of Brazil, Mr. Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva, met with the president of Russia, Mr. Vladimir Putin, at about 12:00 in Brasilia.

The main discussion topics were the end of the embargo on the exportation of Brazilian meats, from animals such as bovines and pigs, to Russia and the interest of the Russian government in conquering the support of Brazil to enter the World Trade Organization.

Lula said Brazil will support Russia to enter the World Trade Organization, but Russia did not agree with the end of the embargo of Brazilian meat. Russia has forbidden the entrance of Brazilian meat in their country because there was a suspection of Brazilian cattle contamination by aftosa fever. Brazilian authorities said there is no danger and the cattle's health has been monitored.
 
By another agreement Brazil will teach the Russians techniques of soccer and the Russians go to repass techniques of athletism and swimming.
