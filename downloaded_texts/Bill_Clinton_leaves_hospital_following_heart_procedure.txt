Former US President Bill Clinton left New York Presbyterian Hospital on Friday after undergoing an hour-long operation to insert two stents into one of his coronary arteries the previous day. Clinton has had previous heart troubles. For instance, in 2004, the former president underwent quadruple bypass surgery in order to restore blood flow to four blocked arteries.

Dr. Allen Schwartz, the chief of cardiology at the hospital, publicly stated that there was "no evidence of [a] heart attack or [of] damage to [Clinton's] heart," and that what occurred was "not a result of either his lifestyle or diet, both of which have been excellent." 

According to a statement from a personal assistant to Clinton, he is currently convalescing at his home in Chappaqua, New York.

Those close to the family subsequently speculated that Clinton's "punishing schedule" could possibly have caused these problems. Some of his recent work has included being a United Nations special envoy to Haiti, having previously visited the country twice since the 2010 Haiti earthquake, which struck the island nation on January 12 2010.

Clinton is now said to be in "good spirts" as having resumed much of his normal work.
