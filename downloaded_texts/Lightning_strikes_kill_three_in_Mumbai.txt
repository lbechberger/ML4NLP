Several people were killed by lightning after thunderstorms struck Mumbai, India on Tuesday evening.

Three people, including a woman, were killed and a twelve-year-old boy was hurt by the lightning in Navi Mumbai. The woman had been injured while selling lampshades on the street, and a third victim was also hurt while parking his motorcycle, trying to get out of the rain. The three were hospitalised immediately, but were declared dead upon arrival. The boy is currently undergoing treatment.

Lightning was also seen in Kurla, Kalbadevi, Chembur, and Bandra-Kurla Complex, but according to the fire brigade no one was injured from those strikes. There was no water logging despite the heavy rains.

Trains on Central Railway were affected by the weather and were half an hour behind schedule. The problem started around 07.00 p.m. Mumbai Time (+330 UTC) and lasted until almost 10.00 p.m. Flights were also delayed; 12 flights, including six Air India and two Kingfisher, were diverted to Ahmedabad as the pilots could not land at the Mumbai airport.
