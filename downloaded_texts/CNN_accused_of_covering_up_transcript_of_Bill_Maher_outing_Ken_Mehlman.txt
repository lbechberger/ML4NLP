Last Thursday, CNN edited out portions of Larry King's "live" interview with Bill Maher for the west coast showing, and removed the same portions from the online transcript.

The deleted portions consisted of Bill Maher saying that Republican National Committee chair Ken Mehlman was gay.

Here is the deleted portion of the transcript:
 
:Larry King: You will name them?
:Bill Maher: Well, I wouldn't be the first. I'd get sued if I was the first. Ken Mehlman. Ok, there's one I think people have talked about. I don't think he's denied it when he's been, people have suggested, he doesn't say...
:Larry King: I never heard that. I'm walking around in a fog. I never...Ken Mehlman? I never heard that. But the question is...
:Bill Maher: Maybe you don't go to the same bathhouse I do, Larry.

Ken Mehlman, currently the chair of the National Republican Committee, has been known to avoid questions about his sexuality, and supports a constitutional ban on same sex marriage.
