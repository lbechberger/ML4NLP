The Queen of Oak Bay, a ferry, owned by British Columbia Ferries, has crashed into several smaller boats in a marina in west Vancouver (Horseshoe Bay) after losing power. There were over 500 passengers onboard as well as 189 vehicles at the time of the crash. There are no reported injuries at this time, as the ferry sounded a warning several times after losing power and drifting uncontrollably into the marina. By approximently 5:30 PM local time officials had determined the hull was sound and the ferry was pulled out of the wreckage and docked at it's berth under the power of tug boats. Passengers who had been stuck aboard the vessel for hours were then allowed to disembark.

There is speculation that the power failure was due to a mechanical fault, possibly the clutch.
