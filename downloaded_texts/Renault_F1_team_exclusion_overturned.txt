According to an FIA press release, the 1-race ban imposed on the Renault Formula One team following an incident at the Hungarian Grand Prix has been overturned.

The team was reprimanded after allowing Alonso to leave the pit lane with the wheel insecurely attached to the car, which then detached itself out on the circuit. The wheel bounced dangerously down the back straight, fortunately not coming into contact with any other vehicles.

After hearing evidence from all parties, including Renault's Engineering Director Pat Symonds, the FIA's International Court of Appeal has repealed the one race suspension, and has instead imposed a $50,000 fine and have "issued a reprimand".

The decision allows Fernando Alonso to race in his second of two home Grands Prix this year, and will likely open the door for Renault's test driver Romain Grosjean to take up the second seat, following the dismissal of seasoned underperformer Nelson Piquet Jr.
