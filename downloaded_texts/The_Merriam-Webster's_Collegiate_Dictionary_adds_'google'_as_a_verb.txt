Google became a verb in the Merriam-Webster dictionary yesterday.

First founded in September 1998, Google quickly became a phenomenon, overtaking the then top search engines Yahoo and Lycos etc.

Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary has added Google, along with Googling, to their dictionary. According to the dictionary, the correct pronunciation is goo-gle, with other forms including googled and googling.

The word 'google' is defined as a transitive verb meaning to use the Google search engine to look for information on the Internet.

This announcement comes on the heels of Merriam-Webster adding 'IM' as both a noun and a verb.
