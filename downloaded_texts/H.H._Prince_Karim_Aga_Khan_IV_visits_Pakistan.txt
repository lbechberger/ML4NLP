His Highness Prince Karim Aga Khan IV, Spiritual leader of Ismaâ€™illi Muslim community, is on an official visit to Pakistan. The objective of his visit is to show coordination with the relief efforts and condolence for the victims of the massive earthquake that struck Pakistan on October 8, which is reported to have killed over 70,000 people and left millions homeless.

HH Aga Khan addressed earthquake survivors at the Thuri camp, reassuring them of the ongoing support from the Aga Khan Foundation Network including helicopters, and of support for reconstruction.

: I also want to say that how important it is that (the process of) rebuilding and reconstruction of your lives should occur in a rational and improved manner so that if there are future problems with seismic activity, population of this area of the world is less at risk where it is today.

The Prince announced a $50.3 million donation for quake relief at the Islamabad donors conference.
