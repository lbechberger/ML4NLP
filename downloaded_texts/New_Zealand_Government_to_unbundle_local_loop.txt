The New Zealand Government has announced that it would require Telecom to unbundled the local loop to provide "faster and better broadband Internet services." New Zealand used to be the only country in the OECD to have investigated unbundling the local loop and then rejected it. This means now that any Internet service provider in New Zealand can create their own plans / speeds for New Zealanders. The shock announcement, due to a leak of the plan to Telecom, saw the stock lose over NZ$2 billion over the New Zealand, Australian and American listings.
