Those trying to view the Nickelodeon channel on Saturday, September 30th need not be alarmed. The popular children's channel will be airing a black screen, starting at 11 a.m, but the channel hasn't ceased.

To promote the Worldwide Day of Play, the channel "goes dark from 11 a.m. - 2 p.m. CT, to encourage kids to play outside. In its third year, the Viacom-owned channel attempts to stop childhood obesity through encouraging activity.

Nickelodeon has set up "Let's Just Play", a website that lists possible activities for parents and kids to participate in. Nickelodeon also awards one grant to an organization in each state.

The program, or lack thereof, is presented by The Alliance for a Healthier Generation, a partnership of The Clinton Foundation and the American Heart Association.

No other kids channel will participate in the Worldwide Day of Play.
