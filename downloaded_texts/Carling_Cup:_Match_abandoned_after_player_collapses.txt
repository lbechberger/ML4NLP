The Carling Cup tie between Leicester City and Nottingham Forest was abandoned at half time after Leicester defender Clive Clarke collapsed in the changing room at half time.

Shortly after the half time whistle, paramedics were called into the changing room before taking Clarke to Queens Medical Centre in Nottingham.

Tim Davies, Leicester City's chief executive said: "He was taken away in an ambulance to hospital. He did offer a few words in the ambulance. Our thoughts and prayers are with Clive and his family."

The Nottingham Forest chief executive added: "I think football is secondary to human issues."

Nottingham Forest had been leading 1-0 at the time after a goal from Junior Agogo, however after a 15 minute delay both managers agreed to abandon the game as many of the players had been shaken up by the incident.

Clarke is currently believed to be conscious.
