India defeated the Windies by 16 runs in the fifth ODI at the Kinrara Oval in Kuala Lumpur, thereby keeping alive their hopes of making it to the finals of the DLF Cup tri-series. The West Indies were chasing 163 to win, but were bowled out for 146 at the end of the 41st over. India will now face Australia in the semi-final on Friday. The West Indies have already secured themselves a place in the final.

Winning the toss, India elected to bat first but got off to a disastrous start. Skipper Rahul Dravid was caught behind off Dwayne Smith's bowling for a duck, and was soon followed by Virender Sehwag who was bowled by Smith after getting just one run off six balls. Suresh Raina, Sachin Tendulkar and Harbhajan Singh helped bring India's total up above the 150-mark, even as the rest of the batting order collapsed under the West Indian attack.

The Indian bowlers managed to put some pressure on the Windie batting order by getting some early wickets. Shivnaraine Chanderpaul, Ramnaresh Sarwan and Runako Morton were all dismissed in the 20s, following which the rest of the West Indies batsmen were all sent back to the pavilion by the 41st over.
