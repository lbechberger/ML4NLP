The cyclone "Ingrid" will hit the coast of Queensland, Australia later today. "Ingrid" is the strongest cyclone that strike Australia since 1974 when cyclone "Tracy" devastated huge areas, including the city of Darwin on the north coast.

Though "Ingrid" has lost momentum during the last few days and now ranks 4 instead of 5, several communities in north-western Australia have been evacuated, daycare centers have closed and flights and ships are grounded or in port. Even more people might be evacuated to nearby airbases if the situation worsens.
