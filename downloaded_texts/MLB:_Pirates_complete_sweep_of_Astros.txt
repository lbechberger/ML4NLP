The Pittsburgh Pirates swept the Houston Astros in a 5-4 victory at the Minute Maid Park Wednesday. Xavier Nady did very well in the first three games of the season, going 1 for 4 with 2 runs to lift the Pirates over the Astros. Tom Gorzelanny made his debut in the last game of the series, giving up 3 runs on 7 hits, with 2 errors, with one ball batted and four strikeouts. This is the first time since May 1991 that the Pirates swept the Astros.

Trailing by two runs in the fifth, Pittsburgh capitalized on three fielding errors to put them ahead by two. Craig Biggio hit a solo home run with two outs in the ninth inning, but Pittsburgh closer Salomon Torres struck out the last batter and picked up the save.

The Astros are off until Friday when the St. Louis Cardinals visit for three games. Meanwhile, the Pirates are concluding their opening road trip in Cincinnati before returning home to face the Cardinals.
