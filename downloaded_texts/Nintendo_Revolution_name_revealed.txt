Today, Nintendo revealed that the real name for the console previously known by the codename "Revolution", is Wii. The name was revealed in a message posted on Nintendo of America's official site, which is shown below.
:Introducing … Wii. 
:As in "we." 

:While the code-name Revolution expressed our direction, Wii represents the answer. Wii will break down that wall that separates video game players from everybody else. Wii will put people more in touch with their games … and each other. But you're probably asking, "What does the name mean?" 

:Wii sounds like "we," which emphasizes the console is for everyone. People around the world, no matter what language they speak, can easily remember Wii without confusion or need to abbreviate - just "Wii". 

:Wii has a distinctive "ii" spelling that symbolizes both the unique controllers and the image of people playing it. And Wii, as a name and a console, brings something revolutionary to the world of video games that sets it apart from the crowd. 

:So that's Wii. But now Nintendo needs you. Because it's really not about you or me, it's about Wii. Together, Wii will change everything. 

In the immediate aftermath of the announcement, the name received much criticism for sounding too much like "wee", an English slang word meaning urine. The name also sounds similar to "yes" in French and "good" in Japanese.
