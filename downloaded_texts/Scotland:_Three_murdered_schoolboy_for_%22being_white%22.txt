The trial of three Scottish Asians began on Monday, October 2 in Edinburgh's High Court. The three men, Imran Shahid, 29, Mohammed Mushtaq, 27, and Zeeshan Shahid, 29 are charged with "racially aggravated murder" over the killing of a 15-year old schoolboy in 2004.

This follows from the conviction of Zahid Mohammed in 2004 of assault in the same incident. Zahid was jailed for 5 years, and was released from jail on license on Wednesday, subsequently giving evidence in this trial. The accused are said to have been involved in the horrific killing of a 15-year old schoolboy in 2004. Kriss Donald was abducted on 16 March, and then stabbed in the lungs, liver and kidney. He was then covered in gasoline and set on fire. The accused, Imran "Baldy" Shahid, Mohammed "Beck" Mushtaq and Zeeshan "Crazy" Shahid had fled to Pakistan after Kriss' murder, and were arrested there in July last year. They were extradited to Britain on exceptional grounds in October 2005. This despite the lack of an extradition treaty between the two countries.

Mohammed said that he had never seen Kriss before, and confirmed that if he had been Chinese, black or "Asian" he would have been left alone. He said that Kriss and his friend had been chosen because they were white.

When asked by advocate-depute Mark Stewart QC if Kriss had said anything, Mohammed said: "Yes - he said 'I'm only 15. What did I do?' or something like that."
