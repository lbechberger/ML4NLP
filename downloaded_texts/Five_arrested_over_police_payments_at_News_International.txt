Four journalists from The Sun newspaper and one police officer have been arrested today as part of Operation Elveden, the investigation into payments by journalists working at News International to police officers.

The police officer has been identified as a 29-year-old officer in the Territorial Policing Command at the Metropolitan Police. The police have not identified the journalists, but the BBC suggest they are Fergus Shanahan, ex-deputy editor of The Sun; Graham Dudman, ex-managing editor; Mike Sullivan, crime editor; and Chris Pharo, head of news.

The Metropolitan Police have said News Corporation disclosed information leading to the arrests. The offices of News International at Wapping have also been searched today as part of the investigation. Operation Elveden has now arrested a total of fourteen people: 12 journalists and two police officers.
