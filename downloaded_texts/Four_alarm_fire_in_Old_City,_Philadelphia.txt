Fire destroyed a building that hosted the Five Spot night club in Philadelphia’s historic Old City section. No one was injured in the blaze,

Firefighters battled for two hours to control the flames and people were evacuated from nearly buildings. Reports indicate that at least one wall inside the group of buildings that make the Five Spot collapsed, causing major structural damage. The fire was contained to three buildings, authorities say.

The Five Spot brought an eclectic mix to Philadelphia’s Old City section where the business had thrived for 11 years. 

During an interview the owner said, "It was just time. We were looking to sell ... to somebody who would carry on the tradition." 

Lovett Hines, a longtime guru of the Philadelphia Jazz music scene said the club was a creative caldron of sorts for the neo-jazz genre. Cohen of Gloucester City said, “It was heart-wrenching; A lot of us were in tears.”
