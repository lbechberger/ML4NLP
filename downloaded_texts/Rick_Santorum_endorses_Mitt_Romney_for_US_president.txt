Former Senator from Pennsylvania and candidate for the 2012 Republican nomination for President of the United States Rick Santorum endorsed the party's presumptive nominee Mitt Romney Monday in an e-mail sent to supporters.

The announcement came after Santorum announced the suspension of his presidential campaign last month and met Friday with Romney for over an hour in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Although Santorum claims in his statement that the possibility of an endorsement was not discussed at his meeting with Romney, he was "impressed with the Governor's deep understanding of this connection [between strong families and a strong economy] and his commitment to economic policies that preserve and strengthen families."

Santorum, who once criticized Romney for his past positions on issues including healthcare throughout the primary campaign, said in his endorsement, "Above all else, we both agree that President Obama must be defeated."

Santorum concluded, "Karen and I know firsthand how difficult the campaign trail can be particularly as Governor Romney faces relentless attacks from the Democrats. We have been praying for him and his family and will continue to do so in the weeks and months ahead. I look forward to working together to defeat President Obama this fall and to protect faith, family, freedom and opportunity in America."

Santorum suspended his presidential campaign last month after the hospitalization of his daughter Bella, who is afflicted with a genetic disorder.
