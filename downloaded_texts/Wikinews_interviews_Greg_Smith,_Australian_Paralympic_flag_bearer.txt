London, Englandâ€” Wednesday, following his team's 64 points to 52 win over Canada, Wikinews interviewed Greg Smith of Australia's national wheelchair rugby team.

 You were the flag bearer for Australia. The Canadians had a flag bearer out there. Any special meaning in this game with two flag bearers from your sport?
::Greg Smith: I don't think so. ... When we meet Canada it's always a bit of a fight, and I think that's what happened tonight.
 Before this game we had an opportunity to talk to [one of the founders] of the sport, Duncan Campbell, and he said the Canadians were supposed to beat you by a few points. 
::Greg Smith: Did he? You better find the founder of the game and tell him that they still have a bit of work to do there. 
 You've already got [three] Paralympic gold medals, and yet you switched to wheelchair rugby. Why was that?
::Greg Smith: Yeah. I'd had a good time with racing. I'd achieved the things I wanted to achieve. I had some time off. Wheelchair rugby came along and I started to play recreationally. The competitive juices got flowing again and here we are. 
 You guys think you have a serious shot at the medals?
::Greg Smith:Look, if we can do the things we've been training on, and the things we have to work on, we've got just as much of a shot as everybody else. We'll just keep doing it process by process.
 You played a great game.
::Greg Smith: Thank you.
