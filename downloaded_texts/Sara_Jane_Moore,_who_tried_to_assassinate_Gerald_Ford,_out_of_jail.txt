Sara Jane Moore, 77, who tried to assassinate Former United States President Gerald Ford in 1975 was paroled from prison in California this afternoon.

Moore tried to assassinate Ford outside of the St. Francis Hotel in downtown San Francisco on January 15, by firing one shot, which missed because a bystander grabbed Moore's arms just seconds before she fired the gun. The bullet missed hitting Ford in the head by inches.

It is not yet known why she was released or what the conditions of her release were.

In 2006, Ford died from natural causes. He was 93.
