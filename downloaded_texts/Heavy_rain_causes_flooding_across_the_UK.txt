Heavy rain and thunderstorms have hit several areas of the UK today, causing flash floods and disrupting some transport links. The UK Met Office have issued severe weather warnings.

In London, parts of Victoria Station were inches deep in water, with rain pouring in through leaks in the roof. Many shops were forced to close, and many trains were cancelled or delayed. On the London Underground network, the Circle and District lines were suspended due to flooding, with several other lines experiencing major delays, and at least nine stations having to close. 

Many of the worst-hit areas have seen schools closed, and driving conditions have been deteriorating, with police advising extra caution whilst travelling on roads affected by standing water.

The flash flooding follows a month of unusually wet weather, in which several areas have had to evacuate people to temporary shelters set up in schools and community centres.
