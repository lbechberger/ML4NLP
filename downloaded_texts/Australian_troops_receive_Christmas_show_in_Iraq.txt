A group of Australian entertainers have sacrificed Christmas at home to spread some Christmas cheer among 450 troops deployed in Iraq. The show was put on for troops in the Al Muthanna Task group at a base near the town of As Samawah.

Performer Little Pattie (Patricia Thompson), who entertained Australian and allied troops during the Vietnam War at the age of 17, led the entertainment. She was joined by Beccy Cole, Angry Anderson, Hayley Jensen, Bessie Bardot, Geoff Barker and Lehmo.

"I feel I'm here to continue a time-honoured tradition which is of Australian performers performing for Australian forces no matter where they are in the world," Little Pattie said.

"It's a thing as a country we need to constantly be reminded of that they represent us as a nation around the world" said Angry Anderson.

The Christmas spirit also reached HMAS Parramatta, which is deployed to protect Iraq's oil infrastructure in the Persian Gulf. The HMAS Parramatta sailors received a surprise visit from Santa Claus who handed out presents.
