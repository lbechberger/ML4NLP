Geelong star Gary Ablett tonight took out the 2007 AFL premiers' best and fairest award, the Carji Greeves Medal, well clear of runner-up - Brownlow medallist, Jimmy Bartel.

Ablett polled 691 votes, 178 more than runner-up Bartel, with Cameron Ling 11 votes back, for 167 in third place. 

Ablett's win capped a stellar year in which he also won the AFL Players Association's Most Valuable Player award, and was named the Coaches' Association's player of the year. He polled votes in every one of his 22 home-and-away matches, and was voted best-on-ground in seven games.

He joins his father Gary Ablett Sr. as a best and fairest winner, with Ablett Sr having earned the award in 1984. 

The award remains elusive for Brownlow medallist Bartel. It was the second straight year in which he was runner-up, having trailed Paul Chapman last season. 

In other awards handed out by the club tonight:
* Best First-year Player: won by Joel Selwood, winner of the AFL Rising Star award.
* Best Clubman: went to defender Matthew Egan, who missed the finals series through injury.
