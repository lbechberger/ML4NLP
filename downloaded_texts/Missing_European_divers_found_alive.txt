Five European divers who recently went missing in Indonesia have been found alive by police. The divers disappeared after being swept away by a huge wave off the coast of Indonesia. 

Three of the divers were from the UK, and one was from each of France and Sweden. They were found after the local police conducted a large search of the area.

The local chief of police reported that the group were found on an island that was 20 miles of the coast of Indonesia. 

"They were found alive and are seeking medical assistance" said Ernest Leandowski, husband of one of the British divers.

The divers went missing after diving in Komodo National Park, in an area known for being quite dangerous. The national park is very popular within the diving community.
