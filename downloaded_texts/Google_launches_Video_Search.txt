The aggressive Internet search king is eyeing your television. Google Inc. today announced the launch of Google Video, a new free service which allows users to search thousands of television programs every day â€” everything from sports to dinosaur documentaries to news shows.

Google Video currently covers eight television channels:

* ABC (KGO)
* KQED
* KRON
* NBC (KNTV)
* PBS
* Fox News
* C-SPAN
* C-SPAN2

Just type in your search term, Google Video will search the closed captioning text of all the programs in the archive for relevant results. It allows users to have a look through short snippets of the text along with still images from the show. If a user provides their zip code, the site displays information on when the show will air next.

Google is a U.S.-based search engine whose mission "is to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful", according to the company's corporate web site. The largest search engine on the web, Google receives over 200 million queries each day through its various services.
