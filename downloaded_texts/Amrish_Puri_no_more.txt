Actor Amrish Puri, who was most known for his role as "Mogambo" in the movie "Mr. India" died of on Wednesday at the age of 72. Hospital sources say that his death was due to a blood clot in his brain after a brain haemorrhage. 

A veteran of sorts, Amrish worked in over 221 movies in his life time, most of which were in Bollywood (Mumbai, India). In his initial attempt to get into the movies in 1954, he was rejected during a screen-test for a hero's role and only started acting at the age of 40 â€” nearly twenty years later. He went on to become the most popular "villain" on the silver screen.
