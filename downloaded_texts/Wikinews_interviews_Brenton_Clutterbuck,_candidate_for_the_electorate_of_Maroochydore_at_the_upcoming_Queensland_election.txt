With a Queensland state election coming up in Australia, many minor parties will be looking to hold balance of power and making the major parties listen to what they have to say. The Queensland Greens are one of these parties.

Wikinews reporter Patrick Gillett held an exclusive over-the-phone interview with Greens candidate for the electoral district of Maroochydore, Brenton Clutterbuck.

Mr. Clutterbuck is a graduate of Sunshine Coast Grammar School and is currently studying Education at the University of the Sunshine Coast. 

Queensland's unicameral parliament is up for election on March 21. The election campaign will run for a total of 26 days following the issue of the writs by Governor Penelope Wensley.
