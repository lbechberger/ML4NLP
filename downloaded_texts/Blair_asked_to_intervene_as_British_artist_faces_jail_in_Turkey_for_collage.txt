Tony Blair has been asked to speak out on behalf of a British artist, Michael Dickinson, who has been charged in Turkey with "insulting the (Turkish) prime minister's dignity". This carries a sentence of up to 3 years in jail. The case was brought after Dickinson displayed a collage showing Tayyip Erdogan, the Turkish Prime Minister, as a dog, being awarded a rosette by President Bush in a pet show.
