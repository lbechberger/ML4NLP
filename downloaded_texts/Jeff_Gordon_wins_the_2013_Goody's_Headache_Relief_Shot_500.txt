Hendrick Motorsports driver Jeff Gordon won the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series 2013 Goody's Headache Relief 500 on Sunday at Martinsville Speedway in Martinsville, Virginia. Gordon started the race in ninth, and eventually won his first race of 2013 and snapping a 32-race winless streak. The race, contested over 500 laps, featured a season-high 17 caution flags for 111 laps and involving 21 drivers, and 15 different race leaders.

The race was primarily dominated by championship contenders Jimmie Johnson and Matt Kenseth, who led 123 and 202 laps, respectively. However, Johnson fell behind after a caution on lap 218, and dropped back further into the field after another caution on lap 229. Kenseth relinquished the lead on lap 237 to Clint Bowyer, and was out of the top ten afterwards. Gordon took the lead from Bowyer on lap 282, which he held for 57 laps. Johnson and Kenseth eventually caught up to the top ten, while Gordon lost positions due to a pit stop, but he reached second place with 80 laps to go. On lap 479, Gordon passed Kenseth entering turns one and two, and led for the remainder of the race. Kenseth finished second, followed by Clint Bowyer, 2012 champion Brad Keselowski, and Johnson closed out the top five. Kevin Harvick, pole-sitter Denny Hamlin, Dale Earnhardt, Jr., Greg Biffle and last week's race winner Jamie McMurray rounded out the top ten.

After winning, Gordon stated:


In the points race, Gordon moved up to third, 27 points behind Johnson and Kenseth, who were both tied for the lead with 2,294.
