Lewis Hamilton, the current leader in the Formula One World Championship, is to take part in this year's Goodwood Festival of Speed. 

The initial announcement was made by veteran DJ Johnnie Walker on BBC Radio Two this morning and later confirmed on the annual events official website. Hamilton will join other well known motorsport personalities, including Damon Hill, Jenson Button and Sir Stirling Moss, at the Festival.

Hamilton became the youngest driver ever to lead the Formula One World Championship after finishing second at the Spanish Grand Prix earlier this month. He leads the championship by two points from team-mate and reigning champion, Fernando Alonso. Hamilton's appearance at this year's Goodwood Festival of Speed has yet to be announced on the official website.

The Goodwood Festival of Speed is an annual hill climb featuring historic motor racing vehicles that is held in the grounds of Goodwood House, West Sussex, UK. It was started in 1993 by the present Earl of March in order to bring motor racing back to the Goodwood estate - a location steeped in British motor racing history. Since the early days of several tens of thousands of visitors over the weekend it has grown to attracting daily crowds of around 100,000 visitors of the three days it is held. The record was in 2003, when a crowd of 158,000 attended before the advanced ticket policy came in to force, but in 2005 attendance has crept back to 150,000. This year's Festival takes place on 22nd-24th June.
