The Denver Bulldogs have defeated the Seattle Grizzlies to win the 2009 United States Australian Football League (USFooty) National Championships - the clubs seventh since 2000. In what was described as a close, hard fought game, the final scores ended with Denver 2-5 (17) defeating Seattle 2-2 (14).

Denver (3-0-0 12pts) knocked off Golden Gate (2-0-1 8pts) for a spot in the final by defeating reigning champions Vancouver by 52 points in the last game of the group stage. Seattle (2-0-1) managed to get through on percentage only over New York (2-0-1).

Seattle were playing in Division 1 this year after defeating Calgary by 19 points in the 2008 Division 2 final. Without Seattle, Calgary won the Division 2 title. Division 3 was won by Dallas , Ohio Valley/St Louis won Division 4 and Calgary Blue took the Women's final. 

While Australian rules football is generally played on a field 170 metres by 160 metres, the fields used for the event were "150 yards long and 110 wide". The two teams consist of 18 players a side. Scores are quoted as goals-behinds (total). Games lasted for two twenty minute halves as opposed to four twenty minute quarters normally played.

Baltimore/Washington fielded a team in both Division 1 and in Division 4.

"Division IV has eight teams that are largely combined squads - although the Baltimore/Washington Eagles are sending a full B squad that will require no combining with extras from other teams," said USFooty media spokesman Kevin Smith.

USFooty president Rich Mann told Wikinews that NFL style competition with six or seven teams was possible.
