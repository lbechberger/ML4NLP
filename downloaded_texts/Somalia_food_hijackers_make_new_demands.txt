The hijackers of a ship carrying food aid to Somalia have demanded that the food be distributed to people in their home area. 

The ongoing crisis looked to be coming to an end when the WFP said an agreement had been made on 5 August, but the hijackers have told the UN IRIN news service that they have refused to sign the agreement.

Initially the hijackers asked for half a million dollars but have sinced claimed that people in their home communities have been neglected despite being badly affected by the tsunami. 

Food aid to Somalia has been suspended since the hijacking over a month ago.
