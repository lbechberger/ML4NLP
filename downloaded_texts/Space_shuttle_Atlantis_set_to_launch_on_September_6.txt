NASA says it will launch the space shuttle Atlantis on Wednesday, September 6, at 12:29 p.m. Countdown until launch will begin on Sunday.

NASA officials also say that the shuttle, launch pad and facilities at the space center suffered no damage from tropical depression Ernesto.

"We had no damage. Zero. Nada. We fully anticipate being ready to go as early as September 6," said Bruce Buckingham, a spokesman for NASA's Kennedy Space Center.

"There was no water intrusion in any operational areas, and so basically we came through this one unscathed," said Bill Johnson, a spokesman for NASA.

If any delay causes the shuttle not to launch on Wednesday, NASA will attempt another launch two days from Wednesday.

A bolt of lightning struck the launch pad which caused NASA to delay the shuttle launch. No damage was sustained when the bolt hit.
