Thousands of mourning Nigerian Muslims have gathered outside the temple of the late Sultan of Sokoto, Muhammadu Maccido, waiting to pay their last respects following his death in a plane crash on Sunday, along with 95 others on board. He was a widely respected man to whom 70 million Muslims looked to for guidance and leadership.

The crowds are being let into the palace in small groups to meet the surviving family of the Sultan, and other traditional rulers. Figureheads such as President Olusegun Obasanjo paid their respects on Monday, along with a host of other dignitaries, including two former presidents. Among those who died in the crash are former President Shehu Shagari's son, as well as the son of the Sultan, Mohammed, and one of his grandchildren. A northern senator was also recovered from the site.

The possibility of pilot negligence is now circulating the investigation, however a final conclusion as to what has caused the crash of ADC Airlines Flight 53 is not yet available. The investigation on the Boeing 737 is expected to be concluded over the coming weeks.
