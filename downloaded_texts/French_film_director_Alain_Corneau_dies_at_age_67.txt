Alain Corneau, a French film director, has died at the age of 67. His death was announced by the Artmedia talent agency. The cause of death was announced as cancer.

Born on August 7, 1943, Corneau's first interest was music. He later went to Paris to study filmmaking. Before the success of his first film, Corneau attempted to make a documentary about New York and an adaptation of a novel. After working as assistant director on L'Aveu with Costa Gavras he directed his first film in 1973, France, Inc.

Corneau's other films include La Menace, Fort Saganne, and the highly successful Tous les matins du monde.

Tous les matins du monde received 11 CÃ©sar Award nominations and won seven of them. The awards included Best Film, Best Director, and Best Music. Corneau said in a 1992 interview in the New York Times that "Many people got emotional about this film, and that made it possible for it to escape cult status."

French President Nicolas Sarkozy commented on the death of Corneau. He said "Corneau was a courageous man and a great director."

Corneau was set to appear at the Toronto Film Festival in September.
