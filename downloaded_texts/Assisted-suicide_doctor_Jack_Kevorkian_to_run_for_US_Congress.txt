Dr. Jack Kevorkian, a prominent United States advocate for the right-to-die for terminally ill patients via physician-assisted suicide, stated on Wednesday that he intends to run for a seat in the United States House of Representatives.

"We need some honesty and sincerity instead of corrupt government in Washington," Dr. Kevorkian said while announcing his bid to represent Michigan's 9th congressional district. He said more information about his candidacy would be forthcoming next week, but he will run without party affiliation.

This seat is currently held by Congressman Joe Knollenberg, a Republican who has been the incumbent since 1993. Democrat and former state senator Gary Peters is also contesting the seat.

Kevorkian told The Oakland Press of Pontiac, which broke the story, that his campaign was in a "formative stage". In order to be on the ballot, Kevorkian will need to collect 3,000 signatures by the middle of July.

"That will be very easy for Jack," said Ruth Holmes, a long-standing associate of Kevorkian. "Jack is in great spirits, and he intends to do this. He just hopes for some honesty in government," she said.

Mike Brownfield, the campaign manager for Knollenberg said it "doesn't affect Joe Knollenberg at all. He's going to keep getting things done for Oakland County's families."

Julie Petrick, spokesperson for the Peters campaign, said "anybody has the right to run" but this is "one of the top races in the country as far as viability and our ability to win here."

Oakland County prosecutor Dave Gorcyca, whose office got Kevorkian convicted of second-degree homicide in 1999, said, "To call attention to himself is standard protocol for Jack when he doesn't have the limelight focused on him. I would not consider his candidacy to be a legitimate one."

Kevorkian served eight years of a 10-to-25 year prison sentence. He was released in June of 2007 on parole due to good behavior.
