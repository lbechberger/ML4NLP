The world's largest package delivery company, UPS has announced a $1 billion dollar expansion at its Louisville, Kentucky air hub to meet their projected future demands. The expansion will add an estimated 5,000 jobs and make the facility the size of 113 football fields when completed in 2010. It will make the facility capable of handling nearly 500,000 packages an hour. 

UPS is already the largest employer in Kentucky with nearly 18,000 employees. Many of the positions are part time and are held by students from the University of Louisville and Jefferson Community College, with whom UPS has a tuition reimbursement deal.
