It has come to light today that toxic paint containing a banned substance is still sitting on the corals in and around the Great Barrier Reef. A Chinese oil carrier ‘Shen Neng’ crashed in 2010 causing the toxic substance that is normally used for the de-fouling of ships to leak onto the Great Barrier Reef. 

The paint is known to contain a toxic substance called tributyltin (also known as TBT). It is also believed that the paint contains copper and zinc. 

The paint is currently covering an area around Douglas Shoal, a small part of the Great Barrier Reef however, when speaking to the Brisbane times earlier this wee, a Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority (GBRMPA) spokeswoman said "I think there is an urgency to clean it up, because each storm season there is a risk that the material will be distributed more widely than it is at the moment due to wave action."

This however is easier said than done for may reason but one in particular, the clean up has been estimated at $50 million. "We have received expert independent advice on what the remediation should involve and what the priorities are for a clean-up operation. The top priority would be to remove the toxic anti-fouling paint and residue which has become embedded on coral rock and mixed with coral rubble." Explained the spokeswoman when talking to the Brisbane Times. 

It is expected that the clean up will begin as the completion of the legal battle that is ongoing regarding the matter. The trial has been set to take place in Brisbane’s Federal court April 2016.
