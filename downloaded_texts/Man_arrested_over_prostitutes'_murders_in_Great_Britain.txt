Tom Stephens, 37, was arrested at his home in Trimley near Felixstowe, Suffolk at 7:20 a.m. Police are also examining a phone and laptop confiscated from Mr Stephens earlier in the week and checking Mr Stephens mother's house.




Stephens is currently in police custody at an unnamed station in Suffolk awaiting questioning.

All five of the women were found dumped naked in the countryside near Ipswich over a period of 11 days. The murders were compared by the media to the ninteenth century killer Jack the Ripper.
