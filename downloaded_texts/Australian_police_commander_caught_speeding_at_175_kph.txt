An on duty superintendent in the New South Wales Police Force was caught speeding in an unmarked police car at 176km/h in a 100km/h zone on the Olympic Highway near Junee, New South Wales on October 13. 

Superintendent Frank Goodyer, who was caught by his own officers in the Wagga Wagga Local Area Command, was charged with driving at more than 45km/h over the speed limit, had his automatically license suspended for six months and fined A$1674. It was reported by Sydney radio station 2GB that it was Superintendent Frank Goodyer as the officer who was caught speeding by his own officers after the New South Wales Police released a media release which did not name the officer who was caught.

Superintendent Frank Goodyer told ABC Radio, "I accepted the penalty. I accept that I've done the wrong thing and, as I say, it is still my job as a senior police officer to encourage safe driving and I will continue to do that regardless of my actions".
