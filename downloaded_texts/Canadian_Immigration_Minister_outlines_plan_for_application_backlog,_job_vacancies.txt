Joe Volpe, Immigration Minister of Canada, has set a goal of 255,000 immigrants in 2006 and a longer term goal of 300,000 by 2010. In 2004, there were 236,000 new immigrants and in 2005 that number is expected to increase to 245,000. The Cabinet must approve the immigration target plan.

There are reportedly 700,000 applications currently in the queue and it can take up to four years for an application to be processed to its conclusion. Canada announced the new immigration plan to clear the backlog on April 18, 2005.

Volpe argues that Canada needs to begin thinking of the Immigration Department as vehicle for recruiting given the country's demographics and associated labour needs.
