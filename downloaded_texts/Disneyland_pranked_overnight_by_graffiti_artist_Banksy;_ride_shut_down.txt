Internationally acclaimed graffiti kingpin and art-saboteur, Banksy, successfully infiltrated the Disneyland themepark in Anaheim, California.

It is alleged that the graffiti bandit extraordinaire clandestinely entered the park over-night, then proceeded to install a piece depicting a prisoner in Guantanamo Bay at the themepark. Banksy installed a sculpture, a life-size doll dressed in an prison inmate's orange jumpsuit and bound and shackled, behind the bars of the Big Thunder Mountain Railroad ride.

Disneyland closed down the ride and removed the sculpture amid fears over public safety.
