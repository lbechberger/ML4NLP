A little over one month ago, a groundbreaking event in the history of micronations, entities that are unrecognized by major world governments but claim independent statehood, took place. The flag of the Principality of Vikesland, a micronation located in Manitoba, was carried into outer space. This is the first time ever that the flag of a micronation has left Planet Earth.

Wikinews was able to have the opportunity to speak with Vikesland's head of state, Prince Christopher I, about this historical achievement. He told reporter Joseph Ford exactly how he got his country's flag into space and what the future may hold for Vikesland. The interview can be read below.
