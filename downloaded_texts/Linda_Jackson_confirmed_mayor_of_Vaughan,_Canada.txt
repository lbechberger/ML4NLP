After three vote recounts it has been confirmed today for the third time that Vaughan, Ontario mayor Linda Jackson was elected on the November 13, 2006 election.

A request for a recount was made by former mayor Michael Di Biase after Jackson was elected short of 94 votes. He then requested another one with the city council and received the same result. Di Biase said the electronic voting machines could have made an error. He then declared the votes illegal and void to the Ontario Superior Court on April 2. The judge just recently requested the third recount. The hand recount, which was done today, came up with the same result.

The recount results are 28,358 votes for Di Biase, 28,448 for Jackson, and 49 disputed.

"This has been very stressful for my family, the staff and the residents of Vaughan," said Jackson. "We're very pleased, we can finally move on."

"I'd like to move forward. I'm glad it's over," Di Biase told reporters.
