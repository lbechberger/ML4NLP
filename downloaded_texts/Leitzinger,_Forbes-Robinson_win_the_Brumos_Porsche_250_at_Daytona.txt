Butch Leitzinger and Elliot Forbes-Robinson drove the #4 Pontiac Crawford GTO into victory lane at Daytona International Speedway late Thursday night as the winner of the Grand American Rolex Sports Car Series Brumos Porsche 250. Early in the race, the #66 car driven by Jorg Bergmeister and Max Papis passed the #10 car in the pole position, maintaining the lead positions for most of the race.

The second caution at lap 32 occurred after a car spun on the infield. The caution lasted 3 laps, and only two laps later a two-car crash happened, sending the race into its third caution. The #06 car, driven by Rob Dyson and Harrison Brix, lost a portion of the car's hood on lap 43 and had to pit, causing the car to drop down a lap.

The Howard-Boss Motorsports #4 car stole the lead position from the #19 Finlay Motorsports car at lap 47, a position it would hold for the remainder of the race. The #10 car with drivers Wayne Taylor and Max Angelelli silently climbed back up to the 2nd position with 17 laps to go. The debuting #65 Pontiac GTO car, sponsored by Auto Gallery, was hit on the backstretch in the left front tire, causing him to spin and hit the wall with 14 laps to go. A similar event happened five laps later when another car spun out. Neither instances resulted in a caution.
