It was reported by the BBC News service that Linda Smith, regular panelist on BBC Radio 4's The News Quiz, stand up comedian, satirist and writer, passed away from chronic ovarian cancer on Monday, February 27, 2006. Ms. Smith died age 48 and is survived by her partner, Warren Lakin.

Ms. Smith gained fame from her many roles on BBC television and radio. During her career she built strong friendships with a number of colleagues. Amongst these is her colleague and friend Jeremy Hardy who responded to the news of her passing saying, "She was our greatest living Englishwoman. She reminds me of Alan Bennett in that wonderful Yorkshire terminology, the exactitude." Mr. Hardy has written a full tribute to Ms. Smith for the BBC website.

A tribute edition of The News Quiz, presented by her fellow panelist Andy Hamilton, will be aired on Friday, March 3, 2006 on BBC Radio 4 at 6:30 p.m. (GMT), repeated the following Saturday at 12:30 - after this the show will be available for one week using BBC's Listen Again service.
