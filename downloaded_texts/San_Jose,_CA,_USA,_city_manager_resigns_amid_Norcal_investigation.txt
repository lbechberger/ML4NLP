Del Borgsdorf, the city manager of San Jose, California announced his resignation on Tuesday, citing "personal reasons" and the "political environment" for his decision. While he denies it is was a factor in his decision, the resignation comes one day after Santa Clara County District Attorney George Kennedy announced his office will investigate the city's contract with Norcal Waste Systems for possible criminal prosecution. Borgsdorf has been criticized by the city council for not informing the council of the $11 million rate hike promised to the company by mayor Ron Gonzales.

Borgsdorf's resignation follows the resignation of other city officials; Stephen Haase, the city's planning director, and John Bjurman, the city's director of information technology, resigned earlier in the week. In addition, the city council formally censured mayor Gonzales last week, and asked for formal apologies from Borgsdorf and city attorney Richard Doyle over the Norcal contract. In addition to the waste removal scandal, the city government has been criticized for a no-bid contract with Cisco Systems to provide IT equipment in the new City Hall; the Cisco deal cost city taxpayers over $3 million in equipment costs and construction delays.
