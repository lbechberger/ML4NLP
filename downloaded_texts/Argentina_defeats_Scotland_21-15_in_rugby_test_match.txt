The Argentine national rugby team has defeated the Scottish equivalent 21-15 in a home rugby test match.

Chris Patterson scored three penalties in the first half, but an Alvaro Tejeda try on his debut left Argentina's Pumas 10-9 at the end of the first half. Paterson, who won his 87th cap at the match, then put Scotland in front with two more penalties, but Argentina's Gonzalo Todeschini followed up with the same for Argentina to put them back in the lead. The final points were also for Argentina, with London Irish centre Gonzalo Tiesi scoring a try in injury time.

The teams will play a second test at Buenos Aires next weekend.
