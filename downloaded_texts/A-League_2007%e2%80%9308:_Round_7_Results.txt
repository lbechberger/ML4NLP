Round 7 of the A-League 2007-08 has produced some interesting moments throughout the country. Accusations have been made that the A-League's 'thug-like' onfield play has decreased its good name, but all teams enjoyed a close-to satisfying game, whatever the result.

WA team Perth Glory is still stalling in its win drought, sparking calls for coach Ron Smith's dismissal, however this was met with limited concern. The low attendance numbers were partly due to the Perth Glory vs Adelaide United match with one of the lowest crowds in Perth's history, 6252.

* Attendance/Average: 49,768 / 12,442
