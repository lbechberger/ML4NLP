"Those who are in power are to be held responsible, and that includes me," Canada's Prime Minister, Paul Martin, told his nation in the first live address by a PM in ten years. "If so much as a dollar is found to have made its way into the Liberal Party for ill-gotten gains, it will be repaid to the people of Canada." 

Conservative Leader Stephen Harper described Mr Martin's broadcast as "a party leader playing for time, begging for another chance".

"After the Prime Minister has shut down the democratic process here ... my guess is there will be more people that are calling for some accountability, perhaps in the form of an election," New Democratic Party (NDP) leader Jack Layton said.

A series of opinion polls show that in an election held today, a minority Conservative government would probably result, reports The Australian.
