A Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agent working for the field office in Buffalo, New York (NY) has been arrested and charged with exposing himself in public. The alleged incident, only now becoming public knowledge, allegedly occurred on Friday, December 7 at about 9:00 p.m on Interstate 90, also known at this part of its length as the New York State Thruway, between exits 57 and 57A in the town of Eden. 

John A. Yervelli Jr., 48, was arrested and charged with public lewdness. He was later released and issued a ticket to appear in Eden Town Court on December 18. According to police, a truck driver was driving eastbound on the expressway when Yervelli pulled up to his window. According to the truck driver, Yervelli was naked from the waist down and making "lewd gestures" to him. The truck driver called police who stopped Yervelli's car at the Hamburg toll plaza and detained him. Yervelli denies the charges.

"It doesn't matter who you are or what you may do for a living. If you are suspected of committing a crime, and we have enough reasonable cause to do so, we are going to do our job and make an arrest," said Lieutenant David Denz of the New York state police department to WGRZ's '2 On Your Side.'

Maureen P. Dempsey, public affairs specialist for the FBI said the Bureau considers the incident "an internal administrative matter" and "the FBI is not commenting on the matter beyond that."

According to NY state law, individuals charged with public lewdness in New York could spend up to 30 days in prison and face fines up to US$500.
