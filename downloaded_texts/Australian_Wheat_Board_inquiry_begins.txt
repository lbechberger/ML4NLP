An inquiry began this week in Sydney into whether Australian companies paid bribes to Saddam Hussein during the UN Oil-for-food programme. 

The inquiry was set up by Prime Minister John Howard, after allegations last year that the Australian Wheat Board paid US$220m in bribes to the Iraqi government. The terms of reference of the inquiry are restricted to the AWB and two other companies.
