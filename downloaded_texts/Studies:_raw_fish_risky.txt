Studies presented at the 72nd Annual Meeting of the American College of Gastroenterology show that eating raw or undercooked fish, such as sushi or sashimi, can lead to severe intestinal problems caused by parasitic roundworms called anisakis.

Symptoms of the infestation include sudden abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, and can be severe enough to warrant a visit to the emergency room. One form of anisakiasis, the illness caused by the infestation, could be difficult to diagnose and could be misdiagnosed as appendicitis, peritonitis, or stomach ulcers, potentially leading to incorrect treatment.
