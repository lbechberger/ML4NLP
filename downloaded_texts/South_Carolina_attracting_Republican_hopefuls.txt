2008 Republican presidential hopefuls are spending a lot of time in South Carolina in the run-up to the 2006 off-year elections. All the interest in the Palmetto State is widely viewed in the light of its place of significance in the GOP's primary calendar. 

Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) leads in most early polls. And he also leads in the pack in handing out campaign contributions to down-ticket Republican hopefuls. Since the beginning of the year, Sen. McCain's Straight Talk America PAC has contributed $172,750 to South Carolina Republican candidates, according to campaign finance reports. In contrast, Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney has contributed roughly $73,000 during the same period. 

McCain has also picked up some influential support recently. Former State 
Attorney General Charlie Condon, veteran consultant Bob McAlister and 
current Attorney General Henry McMaster have all assumed leadership roles in McCain's Straight Talk America PAC. McCain was in South Carolina this week to raise money for Republican Adjutant General Stan Spears, who is running for reelection. 

Former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani also visited South Carolina this week. Mayor Giuliani headlined a fundraising dinner for the state Republican Party. While Giuliani focused his speech on the War on Terror, some were more interested in the New Yorker's position on social issues. 

Conservative reporter Byron York, who attended the event, quotes Palmetto 
Family Council President Oran Smith saying, "Gay rights, abortion, guns 
[Giuliani is pro-gun control] ... any one of them would be a disqualifier, but the three of them together are absolutely insurmountable." 

Representatives from McCain, Romney, and Giuliani's camp all say their man 
is still deciding whether or not he will run for president in 2008.
