Amr Shabana and Nicol David won the men's and women's World Squash Open's respectively, today, in Hong Kong. It was Shabana's second World Title in three years, as the Egyptian also won in 2003. It was David's first time winning the biggest tournament in the world. 

Shabana beat Australian David Palmer 11/6,11/7,11/8 in 40 minutes. Shabana is currently ranked number 5 in the world, and will likely move into the top 3 next month, as neither the World #1 (Theirry Lincou), or number 2 (James Willstrop) reached the final.

David, who is from Malaysia, secured the #1 spot in next month's rankings by reaching the final. David defeated Number 1 seed Rachel Grinham, of Australia 8/10,9/2,9/6,9/7 in 53 minutes, to take the title.
