Daisy Yáñez, a 17-year-old from El Huique, near Santa Cruz, Chile disappeared on Saturday morning.

Yáñez left a letter to her parents saying that she was "going to end her life in Pichilemu," located more than from El Huique. Her parents then went to the Cardenal Caro Province capital and filed a complaint for alleged misfortune with the Police.

The girl's clothes, a backpack, a cellphone and her documents were found in "the grotto of the Virgin" ("la Gruta de la Virgen"), near the Las Terrazas beach in Pichilemu.

Chilean Army, Pichilemu Police, Seguridad Ciudadana (Public Safety Agency), and Investigations Police of Chile personnel are searching Pichilemu's Infiernillo and Las Terrazas beaches for her body.

Yañez was suffering from depression due to family problems. "It all was sudden, there were problems in our family and she left the letter yesterday. We are very distressed," one of her parents told Wikinews on Saturday night.
