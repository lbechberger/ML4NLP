A German businessman who had his camera stolen at a restaurant found and made a purchase for the same camera model on eBay. To his surprise, it was his own stolen camera. 

The reason he wanted the same model was because he had matching accessories. The seller was from his hometown, making it even more suspicious. Police on Thursday were questioning a 34-year old vendor. His statement "claims he got the camera at a flea market, but was also offering other cameras on the Internet."
