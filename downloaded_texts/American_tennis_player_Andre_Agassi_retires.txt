Andre Agassi retired after a defeat by Benjamin Becker of Germany at the U.S. Open. The score was 7-6, 6-7, 6-4, 7-5.

After the match ended, Thirty six year old Agassi sobbed as the 24,000 fans gave him a standing ovation lasting four minutes.

"The scoreboard said I lost today, but what the scoreboard doesn't say is what it is I've found," Agassi told the crowd, tears streaming down his cheeks, his voice cracking with emotion. "Over the last 21 years, I've found loyalty. You have pulled for me on the court and also in life. I have found inspiration. You have willed me to succeed sometimes even in my lowest moments."

In all he won four Australian Opens (1995, 2000, 2001 and 2003), two US Opens (1994 and 1999), one Wimbledon (1992) and one French Open (1999).
