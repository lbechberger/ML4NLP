Egyptian General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi has announced that the army will no longer hold restraint against any remaining protesters. el-Sisi made his first public comments about the crack down on sit ins via Egyptian Television on Sunday, saying full force will be used against "attackers who want to destroy Egypt". 

Tension in Egypt is escalating as supporters of ousted president Mohamed Morsi are still protesting on the street as of Sunday despite the major crack down on sit ins by Egyptian army. According to Russia Today, Morsi followers have reacted to el-Sisi's statement on Egyptian news by taking to the streets on Sunday afternoon. Several protest groups were said to be heading to the Constitutional court. 

Officials within the Muslim Brotherhood stated that planned protests were not followed through due to “the presence of army snipers on buildings along the routes.” Crack downs on protests are believed to continue until pro-Morsi followers agree to stand down from their hope of re-instating Morsi.
