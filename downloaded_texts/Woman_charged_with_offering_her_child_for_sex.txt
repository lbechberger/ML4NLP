A 33-year-old woman is arrested and charged with child sexually abusive behavior as she offered an undercover investigator to take pornographic pictures of her young daughter. She also offered the investigator to have sex with the 7-year-girl, authorities say.

The woman is was charged with five crimes, including child sexually abusive behavior, use of the internet for child sexually abusive actions, and distribution of child sexually abusive material, according to Wayne County Sheriff's Department spokesman John Roach. The woman was also charged with prostitution since she propositioned the investigator herself, and it is known that she advertised herself online as a prostitute. If found guilty, the woman would face up 20 years in prison. The child and four siblings, aged 12, 11, 9, and 6, have been placed into protective custody.

The woman was arrested on March 30 when she took her daughter to a hotel near Detroit Metropolitan Airport where she was to meet the investigator who agreed to take pornographic photos of the girl for a fee. After the woman met the investigator, she offered him to have sex with her daughter for additional money. Also she offered the undercover investigator herself for a fee, according to the Detroit Free Press.

Sheriff Warren Evans says that this is "truly a horrifying case" and thinks that offering ones' own child for sex is "impossible to comprehend". The name of the woman was not made public in order to avoid identifying the girl and her four siblings.
