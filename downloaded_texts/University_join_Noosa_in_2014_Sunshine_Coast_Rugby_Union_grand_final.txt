The first half of the preliminary final was uneventful on field with both teams scoring . A highlight was touch judge Steve Ryan seen laughing with the nearby crowd briefly before continuing his duties. Five-all was the score at half time.

The second half saw three tries scored. Toads scored the opening try at thirteen minutes to take the score to 10–5.

University scored the first converted try eight minutes later to take the lead — 12–10 to Uni. They sealed the victory with thirteen minutes left in the game with a converted try.

University didn't walk away unscathed, however, with either picking up injuries or aggravating existing ones.

University coach Steve Scotland said, "I really don't know how we're going to shape up [...] We had a lot of boys who either picked up injuries or re-injured themselves in that game."

But Scotland says they can still win the premiership decider.
"If we're patient for the whole game we will do all right, but there were some points there where we tried to play a game of touch football, and you can't do that [...] If we can work on that patience we should give ourselves a good chance against Noosa."
