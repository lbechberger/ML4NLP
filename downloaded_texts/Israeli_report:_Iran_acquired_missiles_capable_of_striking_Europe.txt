Israel's intelligence chief Major General Amos Yadlin was quoted by the Haaretz newspaper as saying that BM-25 missiles from North Korea had arrived in Iran. Earlier, a German diplomat confirmed that his country's intelligence sources had recovered information about such an Iran-North Korea missile deal. The BM-25s (which were originally manufactured in the USSR as SSN6s) are capable of delivering nuclear payloads. These weapons have a range of around 2500 kilometres,which brings Europe within striking distance. Teheran already possesses Shihab-4 class missiles which are capable of hitting Israel.
