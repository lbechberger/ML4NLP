A blast is reported to have occurred inside the car park of the Perambra Police station in Kozhikode (Calicut) in the state of Kerala, India. 

One police officer and a seven-year-old boy have reported to be injured in the incident.

The Home minister for state of Kerala Kodiyeri Balakrishnan has ordered a probe to identify the cause of the incident. 

The police say the explosion originating from bombs that were seized by the police in 2002, which now might have been triggered by the heat. Locals reject this explanation and suspect a cover-up. An explosion last week killed eight in Kozhikode.
