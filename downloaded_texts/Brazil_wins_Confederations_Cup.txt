After that, the Argentinians seemed as if they lost belief in positive outcome, but they were determined to change the situation. Riquelme, Sorin, Placente and others were trying to score a goal, but were unable to do get one past the posts.

At the beginning of the second half, in 46th minute, full-back Cicinho, who is currently playing for Santos, made a wonderful pass to Ronaldinho, and there was 3:0 on the scoreboard. Next goal, scored by Adriano, came about twenty minutes later, after Ronaldinho's pass.

Argetinians still wanted to change the result. Two minutes after Adriano's goal, Pablo Aimar, a substitute, scored, but his team was unable to win.

When the match were reaching the end, Brazilian substituters started to dance and be delighted over the title that they won.
