The Heinrich-Heine-University of DÃ¼sseldorf decided yesterday to revoke the doctoral title of German Federal Minister of Education Annette Schavan.

 Most of the fifteen-member faculty council voted for withdrawing her doctorate, while two voted against and one abstained.

 Merkel is to stand for reelection in September.
