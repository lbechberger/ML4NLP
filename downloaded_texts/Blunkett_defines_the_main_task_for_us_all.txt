In today's Guardian newspaper, David Blunkett, former British Home Secretary and a leading light in the Labour party, is reported as saying that "The main task for all of us is to make sure that in years to come Iraq is not seen as Blair's legacy". The Daily Mail, of the same date, reports an interview with Blunkett to the same effect.

It is significant that one so close to the Prime Minister should regard Iraq as an episode that would detract from Tony Blair's reputation in history.
