A giant, smiling Lego man was fished out of the sea in the Dutch resort of Zandvoort on Tuesday. Workers at a drinks stall recovered the 2.5-metre (8-foot) tall toy which had a yellow head and a blue body.

"We saw something bobbing about in the sea and we decided to take it out of the water. It was a life-sized Lego toy," said one worker at the stand. At least one witness says that the toy came from the direction of England.

Upon his chest are the words 'No Real Than You Are', the meaning of which is still unknown, but one website says that the giant toy is a promotional stunt for an artist by the name of Ego Leonard who is believed to be "aiming to document small pieces of beauty from round the world."

It seems the giant toy was built for "Dance Valley" http://www.egoleonard.com/dancevalley/dancevalley.html . It is not known how he ended up in the sea, but has since been placed on display at the drink stand.
