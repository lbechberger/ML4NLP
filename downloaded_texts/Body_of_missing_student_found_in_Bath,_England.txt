A body that was discovered in the River Avon in Bath has been confirmed as missing student James Bubear. The 19 year-old went missing on March 13 after leaving a fancy dress party in the city centre. The creative writing student's death is not being treated as suspicious according to the Avon and Somerset police.

The Bath University student went missing after attending a night out with friends. He left the Revolution bar around 10.30pm and was last seen on CCTV James Street West on the night of his disapperence. His passport and phone was found the next morning by a street cleaner.

Bubear's mother, Vanda released a statement saying "We would like to thank James's fellow students and the people of Bath for taking him as one of their own, and for the support they have given us in these last few difficult weeks. I would also like to thank them for their perseverance in trying to find James. Nothing seemed like it was too much trouble, and for that I am indebted to them."

Concerns have been raised about the saftey on the River Avon in Bath. Marion Flagg's son Casper's body was found in the River Avon on Boxing Day in 2009. She said "It would be nice to see better lighting and to identify where blackspots are," she said. Perhaps we could have railings because there's nothing to stop you from walking straight from the Midland Bridge into the water. It's just a sheer drop and it's very dark."
