Takeo Spikes is no longer a member of the Buffalo Bills. Spikes was involved in a trade Monday that sent the 2-time Pro-Bowl linebacker, as well as backup quarterback Kelly Holcomb to the Philadelphia Eagles for defensive tackle Darwin Walker and an undisclosed draft pick, probably in a later round of the draft. Of Spikes, Eagles general manager Tom Heckert said: "Takeo Spikes is a proven playmaker in the National Football League." Heckert added, "He has the ability to play all three linebacking positions and were happy to add him to our defense."

Spikes has dealt with injuries throughout his career, missing 13 games in 2005 with an Achillies tendon injury. He also missed four games this past season with problems in his hamstring. Despite his injuries, Spikes has been a playmaker for Buffalo, and previously for Cincinnati, rolling up 878 tackles, 21.5 sacks, 12 interceptions, 12 forced fumbles, and 14 fumble recoveries.

Kelly Holcomb, also involved in the deal, is 33 years old, with 11 years experience as the backup quarterback in Indianapolis, Cleveland, and most recently Buffalo. Holcomb spent the 2006 season behind J.P. Losman.

Darwin Walker is a 7-year veteran of the league. In that time span, Walker has accumulated 170 tackles, 27.5 sacks, and 5 fourced fumbles, as well as 5 recoveries.
