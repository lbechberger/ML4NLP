Tawfik Tirawi, head of Palestinian Intelligence in the West Bank, resigned Thursday. Fatah officials said he told President Mahmoud Abbas that too little was being done to curb lawlessness in the West Bank and Gaza.

"I cannot work under these conditions," he wrote in a letter of resignation given to Abbas.

He reportedly claims other heads of Palestinian security organizations had not done enough to impose the rule of law Abbas has promised. Abbas himself said some senior Palestinian officials are blocking his reform efforts.

Tirawi is the most senior security official to resign since Abbas' election in January.
