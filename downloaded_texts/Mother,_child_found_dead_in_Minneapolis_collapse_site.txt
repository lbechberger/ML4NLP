Hana Sahal, a 22-year-old nursing student from Somalia, and her nearly two-year-old daughter were found dead after the collapse of the I-35W bridge in Minneapolis. Sahal was five months pregnant. With other remains discovered Friday, the death toll from the collapase is now at least nine.

Sahal died due to head injuries caused by the bridge's collapse. Omar Jamal, the director of the Somali Justice Advocacy Center said that authorities informed Sahal's family of the death on Friday.

Minneapolis received US$5 million in emergency aid the morning after the disaster, and a further $5 million was secured by Minnesota's congressional delegation to set up alternative transportation options for motorists.

According to authorities, all remains that have been found have been identified, although there still may be people trapped in the bridge.
