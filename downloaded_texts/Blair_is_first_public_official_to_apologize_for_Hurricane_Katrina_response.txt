British Prime Minister Tony Blair has apologised to Britons affected by Hurricane Katrina. Many British citizens who were trapped in the New Orleans have complained to the British Foreign Office about the lack of response from their government after the hurricane destabilized almost 200 miles of the United States gulf coast.

British nationals living and vacationing in New Orleans reported that U.S. authorities had refused to evacuate them as Hurricane Katrina approached the city, leaving them stranded in their hotels. President George W. Bush has been criticized for refusing material aid from France and Britain in rescuing people trapped in New Orleans.
