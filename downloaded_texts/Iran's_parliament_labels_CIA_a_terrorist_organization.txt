On Saturday, Majlis of Iran, Iran's parliament, approved a non-binding resolution designating the United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the U.S. Army as "terrorist organizations", in what is seen as a largely symbolic move. The designation was backed on Sunday by Iran's Foreign Ministry. Earlier in the week, the U.S. Senate had passed a resolution giving a similar designation to Iran's Army of the Guardians of the Islamic Revolution.

"The aggressor U.S. Army and the Central Intelligence Agency are terrorists and also nurture terror," said Iranian lawmakers. 215 members of the 290 members signed the declaration.

"Terrorist" acts cited by Iran's parliament included the U.S. Army's use of atomic bombs against Japan in World War II, its use of depleted uranium munitions in the Balkans, Afghanistan, Iraq and its use of torture against prisoners in Guantanamo Bay detention camp in GuantÃ¡namo Bay, Cuba and Abu Ghraib Prison in Iraq. Iran's parliament also cited the CIA's role in training the Mujahideen during the Soviet Union's occupation of Afghanistan.

If ratified, the resolution would become law, but would likely have little political effect given that the U.S. and Iran do not have diplomatic relations.
