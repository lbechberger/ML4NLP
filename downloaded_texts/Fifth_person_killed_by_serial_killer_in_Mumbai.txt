A serial killer on Mumbai's streets killed yet another person last night; making the latter one of five young men murdered recently. The body of a 20-year-old unidentified man was found in a secluded spot on the railway tracks between Churchgate and Grant Road, his head was crushed by a 10 kg stone. A senior police official said that they had found food at the crime scene, indicating that the victim had been offered it before being bludgeoned.

The police are awaiting the post-mortem report to confirm whether this victim, like the others before him, had been sexually assaulted before being murdered. This attack comes just a day after another body was found a kilometre away, near the Wankhede Stadium rail bridge. Police say that the perpetrator may have claimed up to eight lives so far, although his role has only been confirmed in four cases. The killer, suspected to be a man in his late 20s, targets young, male ragpickers in South Mumbai, killing them in the early morning and leaving a beer can at the scene of the crime.

Although the latest killing appears to be the work of the same man, Railway Police officials are wary of declaring this homocide as the work of the same perpetrator, saying there were "similarities as well as differences in the modus operandi of the murderer". Mumbai Police have established a 90-man team tasked with nabbing the serial killer, who a senior police official compared to Raman Raghav, who bludgeoned 9 pavement dwellers in their sleep in the 60s.
