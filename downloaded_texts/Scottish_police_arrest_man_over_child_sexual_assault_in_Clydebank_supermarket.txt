Strathclyde Police have arrested a 19-year-old man in relation to a reported incident of a boy, aged four, being sexually assaulted in the toilet of an Asda supermarket in the town of Clydebank in West Dunbartonshire, Scotland. The suspect is being held in police custody and has an appearance scheduled for Tuesday at Dumbarton Sheriff Court.

Police were initially alerted to the incident at 31 Britannia Way in Clydebank approximately 1355 BST (1255 UTC) Tuesday. According to Sky News, the boy's mother had given him permission to enter the toilet by himself as she waited outside. Police said the incident took place in the minutes following the boy's entrance into the toilet; upon his departure, the boy raised the alert.

"This is an isolated incident, nevertheless, one that has caused significant stress to the young child and his family," said Detective Inspector Graham Cordner, who said the child was not injured and is at home with his family.

Police said that they had taken one whole day to interview the child and an additional day to have initial investigations into the incident. All supermarket staff have been questioned and CCTV video has been examined.

"We have taken this report very seriously", said a spokeswoman for Asda. "We alerted the police and are supporting them fully in their investigation."
