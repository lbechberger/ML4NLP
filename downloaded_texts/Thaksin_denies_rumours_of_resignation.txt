With a boycott by all seat-holding parties other than Thaksin Shinawatra's Thai Rak Thai party, the embattled Prime Minister of Thailand has ruled out resigning as demanded by protestors.

Announcing his plan to lead Thai Rak Thai candidates to sign up for the April 2 snap election on Thurday morning, Thaksin stated that it was business as usual in his role as now-caretaker Prime Minister. His intention is to address a rally this Friday at Sanam Luang, the location of last Sunday's protest. According to Thailand's English-language paper, The Nation, he may announce proposals to have any newly formed parliament work on constitutional amendments.
