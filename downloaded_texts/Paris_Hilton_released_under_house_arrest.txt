Paris Hilton has been released from prison after serving only three days of her 23-day sentence, reports TMZ.com, though she will receive credit for five days (as the authorities in Los Angeles have counted Sunday evening and Thursday morning as a part of her sentence).

Reports indicate that Hilton was overcome by the stress of incarceration (credited as "medical reasons"), and reached an agreement to serve the remaining days of her sentence under house arrest. She will have to spend 40 days in house arrest, forced to wear a tracking ankle bracelet. The 26-year-old Hilton was released from the Los Angeles Jail Thursday and was placed into house arrest.

In January, the hotel heiress pleaded guilty to charges of alcohol-related reckless driving. In February, the California highway patrol caught her violating her three year probation. Hilton on Sunday entered the Century regional detention facility in Los Angeles, almost immediately after the MTV Movie Awards.
