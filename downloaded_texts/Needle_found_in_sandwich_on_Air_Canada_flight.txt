Air Canada stated that a passenger found a sewing needle in a sandwich Monday on a flight from Victoria, British Columbia to Toronto, Ontario.

Air Canada spokesman Peter Fitzpatrick stated they are working with the unidentified caterers "to ensure heightened security measures have been put in place." He also stated authorities are undertaking an investigation. 

Last month, the FBI and Dutch authorities investigated needles in six sandwiches on Delta Air Lines flights. Four of those were discovered by passengers; one passenger was injured but dismissed medical treatment. Robert van Kapel of the Dutch police said it is not yet known if the two incidents are linked or if there is a copycat.
