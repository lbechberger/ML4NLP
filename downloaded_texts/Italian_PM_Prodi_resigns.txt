Italian Prime Minister, Romano Prodi, delivered his resignation today to the country's President Giorgio Napolitano. The decision came following an embarrassing loss suffered by the Italian government on a foreign policy vote in the Italian Senate, concerning the engagement in Afghanistan and after a political split in the government coalition about the planned expansion of a U.S. Army base in Vicenza, in Northern Italy.

President Napolitano will begin consultations among Italian party Leaders on the next Thursday: according to the Italian Constitution, the President can send back Prodi to the Chambers for a vote or might choose another Prime Minister who might have enough support to put together a new government, or could be forced to dissolve the Parliament and call for new elections. 

In the meantime, the President asked the government to stay on in a caretaker role.

Prodi has been Prime Minister for nine months.
