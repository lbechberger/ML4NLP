Reports say that at least 200 members of the Hamas security force have taken control of the security headquarters of Fatah in Gaza. Reports also say that the attack of the headquarters killed 10 people and injured at least 30.

"Hamas has decided to punish the attackers and the killers and it will not be reluctant to punish them without any mercy. They crossed all the red lines," said Fawzi Barhoum, a top spokesman for Hamas in a statement to the press.

Mortar shells and rockets were fired at the headquarters before the forces entered it and took control.

Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas has condemned the attack and has accused Hamas of attempting a "coup" of the Palestinian government.

"The political and military leaders of Hamas are planning a coup against the legitimate institutions, thinking they will be able to control the Gaza Strip by force," said Abbas in a statement to the press.
