British singer, song-writer and guitarist John Martyn has died at the age of 60. He died while in a hospital in Ireland.


"With heavy heart and an unbearable sense of loss we must announce that John died this morning," said a statement posted on his website. The details surrounding his death are not known, but Martyn has admitted to past drug and alcohol abuse.

Martyn had to have his right leg amputated in 2003 because of a cyst, but despite the loss, he continued to play his music from a wheelchair. On December 31, 2008 during the UK's New Year's party he was awarded the Order of the British Empire (OBE) award.

Martyn is said to be best known for his album Solid Air, made in 1973. He previously played with other music stars such as Phil Collins, who recorded an album with Martyn in 1980 titled Grace and Danger. Martyn also worked with Eric Clapton.

"John’s passing is terribly, terribly sad. I had worked with and known him since the late 1970s and he was a great friend. He was uncompromising, which made him infuriating to some people, but he was unique and we’ll never see the likes of him again. I loved him dearly and will miss him very much," said Collins in a statement to the press.
