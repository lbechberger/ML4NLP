A bomb explosion heard throughout Jerusalem wounded over 30 people at a crowded bus stop Wednesday, leaving one woman dead. Initial reports by local media indicated that the entrance to the city had been closed and the Associated Press said it appeared to be a militant attack, the first since attacks were halted in 2004. A day later, CNN called it a terror attack.

The blast blew out the windows of two buses and Israel's national rescue service have said that the explosion seriously wounded 15 people. The injured were carried away from the scene with stretchers.

A 59 year-old British student, identified as Mary Gardner, died in a hospital following the incident.

Micky Rosenfeld, a foreign press spokesman for the Israel Police, said a device in a bag left in a phone booth near the bus station exploded when the bus passed.

The blast occured near the entrance to the city and next to the city's central bus station, and came at the same time when tensions are rising between Israel and the militant group Hamas.
