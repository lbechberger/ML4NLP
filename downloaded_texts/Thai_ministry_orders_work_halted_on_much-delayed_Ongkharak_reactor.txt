According to a report by Thailand's The Nation, the Science Ministry has ordered a halt to work on the much-delayed Ongkharak reactor.

The reactor, first commissioned from U.S. firm General Atomics in 1997 by Thailand's Office of Atomic Energy for Peace (OAP) has had prolonged delays in the project and faced threats from activists.

Despite calls in 2002 for the reactor to be completed within two years, the reported position of the government now is to seek advice from the office of the Attorney General on how to proceed. Irregularities uncovered by the State Audit Commission may lead to cancellation of the contract and legal action taken against people believed to have been involved in corruption or abuse of authority.
