The Ministry of Defence has tonight confirmed that a British soldier has been killed whilst fighting with insurgents in southern Afghanistan. 

The unnamed troop was killed in a gun battle with Taleban forces in the volatile Helmand province at around midday local time. 

A spokesman from the Ministry of Defence said: “The soldier died as a result of injuries sustained during the contact. Three other British soldiers received minor injuries.” The MoD also said that they are in the process of informing the soldier’s family about his death.

Defence Secretary Des Browne said: "I was deeply saddened to be informed of the death today of a British soldier and the injuries of three others as they supported the NATO mission in Afghanistan," he said. "I wish to express my sincere condolences to their families and friends. My thoughts are with them at this difficult time."

So far, twenty British armed forces personnel have died in Afghanistan.

Today, it has been reported that around seventy Taleban fighters were killed when they clashed with Afghan security forces and Nato-led troops.
