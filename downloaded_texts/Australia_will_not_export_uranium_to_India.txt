The Australian foreign minister, Alexander Downer, has confirmed that Australia will not export uranium to India while it is not a signatory of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). The confirmation was prompted by a recently announced agreement between India and the United States involving the sale of civilian nuclear technology.

"Well our policy has developed over many years, going right back to the time of the Fraser Government actually, our policy has been that we would only export uranium to countries that are signatories to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty," Mr. Downer said in an interview on today's AM radio programme.

Mr. Downer also said that the Australian government was disappointed when India and Pakistan developed nuclear weapons, but supports the new United States deal with India as an attempt to engage with India and "open up their civilian nuclear industry to International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors."

"We've considered very carefully over the last few months the American proposal for this agreement that President Bush has signed with the Indians, and our view about it is that it's a good step forward in what's been a difficult situation," Mr. Downer said.

The Australian Labor Party (ALP) supported the government's stance on exporting uranium to non-NPT countries. "Any future agreement to export to India must be dependent on India becoming a signatory to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and the negotiation of a bi-lateral agreement ensuring that Australian uranium is only used for peaceful purposes," they said in a press release.
