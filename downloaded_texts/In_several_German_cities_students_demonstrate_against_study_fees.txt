In Germany 30,000 students demonstrate in 5 big cities against study fees. People think, that paying for information is not socially compatible and gives only privileged people the chance to get in depth information. Germans demand a broad and free education for every citizen of the world. In the next weeks, students will fight for justice and show solidarity with the Countries of the Federal Republic, which want to already demand study fees in the next term.

At this time, the first education in Germany is free, but the Federation decided days ago, that the states of the Federal Republic can create their own financing concepts, because CDU governed states complained against the Federation.

Several German states partly plan to plug budget gaps with the money from the young people willing to give their power for a broadly educated Germany.
