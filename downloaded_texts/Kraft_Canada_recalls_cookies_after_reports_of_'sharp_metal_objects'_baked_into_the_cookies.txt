On March 2, 2007, Kraft Canada Inc. (Kraft) issued an alert to news media requesting the recall of a brand of cookies manufactured in their Toronto, Ontario plant.

The news release indicates that certain packages of Christie Chewy Chunks Ahoy! cookies may have been tampered with. Kraft had received 2 complaints from consumers that small, sharp metal objects had been found in the cookies.

The product had been distributed to stores in Quebec, Ontario, and to a Wal-Mart in Labrador City, Newfoundland and Labrador in the province of Newfoundland. Kraft indicated that no other Christie products are affected by the recall.

Kraft is undertaking an internal investigation and has referred the case to police, although they suggest that there have been no serious injuries associated with consumption of the product.

According to spokesperson Lynne Galia, Kraft is treating the case as suspected tampering, as "the material found in the cookies is not found in our plant."

The police investigation is in early stages, with accidental contamination or intentional tampering both being given consideration.

The product recall affects the following packages of Christie Chewy Chunks Ahoy!:
