One Frontier Constabulary official died and several other people were injured on Monday when a remote-controlled bomb was detonated at Panjgur, in the Balochistan province of Pakistan. The Balochistan Liberation Front (BLF) later claimed responsibility for the attack.

Witnesses say the bomb was planted in a motorbike parked on Hospital Road in the town. When town security vehicles were passing, the bomb exploded. A security official, identified as Head Constable Mohammad Rafique, was killed. Ten others were severely injured; according to witnesses, this included six civilians. The victims were immediately rushed to hospital.

The blast was so powerful that the sound could be heard in a significant area of the town. Three of the injured were Frontier Corps (FC) officials. Some victims are said to be in a critical condition. 

Frightened shopkeepers soon shut down after the incident. Police soon arrived in the area to take control of the situation.

Doda Baloch, spokesman for the BLF, called journalists to say that they had executed the attack with a remote-controlled motorcycle bomb. He claimed the attack killed eight from the security forces, including an officer.

An investigation into this explosion is underway, said Panjgur police.
