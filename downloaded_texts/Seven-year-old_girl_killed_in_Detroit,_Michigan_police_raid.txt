A seven year-old girl was shot and killed Sunday during a police raid in Detroit, Michigan, United States when one of the officer's guns was accidentally set off during an argument with the girl's grandmother. Police were raiding the home in search of a 34 year-old male suspect accused of murdering teenager Jarean Blake near a local liquor store the previous night.

According to police reports, Mertilla Jones got into a verbal confrontation with a police officer, which quickly turned physical. The woman, according to the police, then came into contact with the officer which inadvertently set off the gun that he was carrying. The bullet then struck the girl, Aiyana Jones, in the neck while she was sleeping on the family's couch.

The murder suspect was apprehended later that day. However, the family and public became outraged at the killing of seven year-old Aiyana. In response, the Detroit Police Department held a press conference.

"We cannot undo what occurred this morning [...] All we can do is to pledge an open and full investigation and to support Aiyana's family in whatever way they may be willing to accept from us at this time," said Assistant Police Chief Goodbee speaking on behalf of the Police Chief, who was on vacation at the time of the shooting.

Meanwhile the girl's father, Charles Jones, was outraged about the incident. "She had a lively, free spirit," said Jones. "They came into my house with a flash grenade and a bullet [...] They say my mother [Mertilla] resisted them, that she tried to take an officer's gun. My mother had never been in handcuffs in her life. They killed my baby and I want someone to tell the truth," he added.

The incident is currently under investigation by the Detroit Police Department. It is not known who fired the shot that killed the girl, or whether or not they will receive any disciplinary action from the department.
