A soldier from Hereford, Britain died yesterday in Afghanistan's Helmand province. The incident occurred when the soldier (who belongs to Third Battalion The Rifles) was on foot patrol, and takes the death toll in the conflict to 251, which is four short of the number who died during the Falklands war in 1982.

The soldier, whose name has not yet been released by the UK Ministry of Defence, died due to the wounds incurred when the bomb exploded in the southern part of Sangin, Helmand. Lieutenant Colonel David Wakefield, spokesperson for Task Force Helmand, stated: "He was part of the operations that have been bringing security to the local population. It happened in the 'green zone' south of Sangin district centre."

He further added that "he [the soldier] was on a foot patrol as part of the operations that have been bringing security to the local population in that area." The soldier's family has been informed about the former's death.

Earlier, Peter Aldridge, aged 19, belonging to A Company 4 Rifles, died after a blast in the same place. The teenager's final words were to express his love for his mother. His family said that their son died a hero and had lost his life "doing what he believed in." According to them, Peter had earlier stated: "If I'm going to die I want to die a soldier."
