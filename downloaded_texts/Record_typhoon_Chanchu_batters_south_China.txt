A powerful typhoon that killed 37 people in the Philippines has hit southern China. Typhoon Chanchu battered coastal Guangdong and Fujian provinces where an estimated 900,000 fled to safety. With winds up to 170 kph, Chanchu is the strongest typhoon on record to enter the South China Sea in May. 

Xinhua news agency said 11 people had died in China from the storm and four others were missing. The storm made landfall near Shantou in the northern tip of China's Guangdong province.

Xinhua reports that Chenchu slammed in Shantou City of Guangdong and continued northward bringing gale-force winds and rainstorms to the regions and triggering flooding, mountain torrents and landslides. Nearly 200 houses in north Shantou were flooded stranding more than 6,400 people. 

Typhoons occur in the South China Sea every year between May and September.
