Six Apart, the owners of the blogging software Movable Type and TypePad, have acquired the RSS reader Rojo, for an undisclosed amount, rumoured to be less than US$5,000,000.

Six Apart does not plan to continue development of Rojo, and "intends to sell a majority interest in Rojo's newsreader services in the coming months", making them a minority stockholder. Rojo founder and CEO Chris Alden and CTO Aaron Emigh will join Six Apart's executive team.

Rojo was founded in June 2003, and launched in October 2004. Rojo had a promising start and its userbase is still growing gradually. But the feed reader market is dominated by Ask.com's Bloglines and NewsGator.
