The European Union has agreed to give Iran two more weeks to comply with the United Nations resolution to stop its nuclear program.

"We in the EU and Germany have no interest in an escalation in the coming weeks due to deliberations in the Security Council. That's why we will neglect no opportunity to keep trying to find out through talks whether there is a possibility to return to the negotiating table," said Frank-Walter Steinmeier, the German Foreign Minister.

The U.N. gave Iran until August 31 to halt is nuclear program which Iran states is for peaceful purposes.

"Hyperbole against Iran's peaceful nuclear activities by Western countries especially the US will continue. Today those countries, which have filled up their arsenals with nuclear weapons, threaten nations and make claims about human rights and democracy. They are the biggest liars of the world. Avaricious powers can't create any obstacles on the way to the progress of our nation," said Iran's President, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.

Germany, China, Russia, the United States, Great Britain and France are scheduled to meet on September 7, 2006 in Berlin, Germany to discuss the next step regarding Iran's nuclear program.
