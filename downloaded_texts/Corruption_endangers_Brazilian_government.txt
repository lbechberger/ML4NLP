Denunciations of political corruption threaten the Brazilian government. The most recent case involves a deputy of the political party PTB (who supports the government of the Brazilian President Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva) in a scandal of the services of post office.

Lula's government representatives said that they will investigate all the denunciations and affirmed that the government is a victim of political enemies.
