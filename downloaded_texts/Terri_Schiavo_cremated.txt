Michael Schiavo's lawyer informed the media that Terri Schiavo's body was cremated last Saturday at 9 a.m. on April 2nd at the National Cremation Society in Florida.

A complete autopsy was done prior to the cremation to dispel any beliefs that the cremation was done to hide anything about Schiavo's condition. According to the district medical examiner's office in Largo, full results of the autopsy will not be ready for several weeks.

Terri Schiavo's parents, the Schindlers, requested an independent expert to observe the operation, but the request was denied by medical examiners.

Both sides of Terri Schiavo's family plan to have separate funerals. Mr. Schiavo apparently plans to bury Terri's remains in Pennsylvania, while the Schindlers are planning a funeral mass tomorrow at the Holy Name of Jesus Catholic Church in Gulfport, Florida.
