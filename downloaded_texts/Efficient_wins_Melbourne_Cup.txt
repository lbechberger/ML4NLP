The racehorse Efficient has won the 2007 Melbourne Cup. 

Flemington Racecourse in Melbourne, Australia was abuzz today as the Melbourne Cup was raced for the 147th time. The New Zealand horse Efficient finishing the 3200m race in a time of 3:23.24. The horse, which had won the 2006 Victorian Derby, became the first horse since Phar Lap (also a New Zealand horse) to come back and win the Melbourne Cup a year later.

The race ended with a stunning finish as Efficient and his jockey Michael Rodd came from behind to overtake Purple Moon in the final stretch. The odds on Efficient were 24-1 to win and A$7.40 for a place. Purple Moon finished second and Mahler finished third.

120,000 spectators looked on as Mahler took the lead at 1600m and fell back to third in the closing stages. Early leader Tungsten Strike finished 21st (last).

The win is the third of its kind for owner Lloyd Williams with two previous victories in the 1980s. Williams had two horses in the race, Zipping and Efficient, but Zipping fell to fourth place while Efficient surged forward. 

Lloyd Williams' son Nick was at the raceground and was aiming high for Efficient. 

"People keep telling me the last horse to do what he has done was Phar Lap," he said.

Efficient was a favourite for the 2006 Melbourne Cup but was scratched at the last minute.
