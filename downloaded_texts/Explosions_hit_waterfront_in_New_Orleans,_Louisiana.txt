Fires are raging in New Orleans following a series of explosions along the waterfront. The cause of the blasts is not known. A chemical reaction with the rising waters is one possibility. One official has stated that the explosions took place at a chemical storage facility near the riverfront a few miles south of the French Quarter.

This news comes as police suspended search-and-rescue operations in order to attempt to halt the rising levels of looting in the city, and after Louisiana Governor Kathleen Blanco ordered National Guard troops to "shoot and kill" rioters and looters. 





Although aid has been promised by the US federal authorities, New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin criticised them for what he feels is a slow response.

"They don't have a clue what's going on down there," Mayor Ray Nagin told WWL-AM Thursday night.

"They flew down here one time two days after the doggone event was over with TV cameras, AP reporters, all kind of goddamn â€” excuse my French, everybody in America, but I am pissed."
