Cristóbal Cortina and Víctor Vergara, in conjunction with their horses "Cumpa" and "Tío Pedro", have won the last phase in the 62nd Campeonato Nacional de Rodeo. They earned the maximum honour for a Chilean huaso: to win the Chile Championship.

José Luis and Jorge Ortega, the horsemen favoured to win, won second place mounting "Ahijado" and "Floro"; third place was won by Ricardo Bustamante and Eduardo Salas with "Rociado" and "Viajero".

The winners of the movimiento de la rienda were Yenny Troncoso with "Fachoso" and Ricardo González with "Chao No Más", in the feminine and masculine competence, respectively. The Sello de Raza was given to "Fantástico", from the Santa Isabel Farm and mounted by Eduardo Tamayo Órdenes.

This championship concludes the Chilean rodeo 2009–2010 season and was performed at the Medialuna in Rancagua.
