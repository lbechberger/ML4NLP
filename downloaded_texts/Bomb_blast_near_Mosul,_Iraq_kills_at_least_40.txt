A bomb blast near the northern city of Mosul has killed at least 40 Iraqi people. The bomber struck shortly after noon in front of a U.S. military base. The Defence Ministry said 30 people were injured in the blast which they said was carried out by a suicide bomber. The U.S. military says a car bomb had exploded at an Iraqi police recruiting centre at Kisak, west of Mosul. 

The blast follows the killing of 20 Shiites at a mosque compound in Baghdad. Shiites have blamed U.S. forces for killing 22 people Sunday and cut off political talks in protest. The United States has said no mosque was attacked.
