Two people have been injured in a road traffic accident involving two vehicles on the Isle of Man. One of the two men was driving a Toyota Celica and the other a Renault Laguna.

Police reported that the collision occurred at around 2150 GMT on Sunday near to the location of Greeba Castle. The two men, who were aged 32 and 19, were both injured, with the 19-year-old man having to be physically cut out of his Toyota by workers from the emergency services.

Both gentlemen had to be transported to Nobles Hospital; however, police officers noted that neither of the two suffered from life-threatening injuries. The road which the collision occurred on had to be closed for roughly five hours.
