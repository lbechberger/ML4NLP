American comedian Harvey Korman has died at the age of 81, according to a statement released by his family.

Four months ago, Korman suffered a rupture in an aortic aneurysm located in his abdomen and died from complications related to the illness.

"Everything he did on The Carol Burnett Show, especially the Mother Marcus character, was a special favorite. Everyone in the hospital referred to him as 'miracle man' because of his strong will and ability to bounce right back after several major operations. It was a miracle in itself that he survived the incident at all," said Korman's daughter, Katherine Korman, in a statement to the press.

Korman, who started his career on Broadway in New York City, was famous for and won awards for his appearances on the Carol Burnett Show in the 1960's and 70's. He also was a starring actor in the film Blazing Saddles as well as other movies made by Mel Brooks. As a result of his work on television, Korman was nominated for seven Emmy Awards, but won a total of four for his work on the Carol Burnett Show.
