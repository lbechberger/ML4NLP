Mel Gibson made anti-semitic remarks after being pulled over for drunk driving, having a blood alcohol level of .12. After being pulled over, Gibson berated the police, calling them 'motherfuckers' and saying he would 'fuck them'. The police report also said "Gibson almost continually [sic] threatened me saying he 'owns Malibu' and will spend all of his money to 'get even' with me." Gibson went on to say "Fucking Jews... the Jews are responsible for all the wars in the world," and then he asked the deputy: "Are you a Jew?" He also is reported to have referred to a female police officer as "sugar tits".

On Saturday, Gibson released this statement.
