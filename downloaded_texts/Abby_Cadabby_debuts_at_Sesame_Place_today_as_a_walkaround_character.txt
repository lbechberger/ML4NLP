The Sesame Place theme park in Langhorne, Pennsylvania opened for its 2007 season this morning, adding Abby Cadabby to its all-star lineup of characters that children can meet.

Described as a "sweet, inquisitive enthusiastic three-year-old fairy-in-training" who loves making new friends, the character stars in a musical show called Abby Cadabby's Treasure Hunt. Featuring all of the stars of Sesame Street, the production joins Elmo's World Live: Fishes.

Abby was not the first recurring female character to be introduced to Sesame Street since 1993, as press materials for season 37 of Sesame Street proclaimed; Phoebe and Googel from the short-lived Monster's Clubhouse segment both hold that title. She is however the first new female character since 1993 to show any lasting power. Her performer, Leslie Carrara, says Abby will appear in "almost every episode next season".

The Langhorne, Pennsylvania attraction was opened in 1980, sparking robust commercial development in the town. While similar parks have opened in Irving, Texas, Tokyo, Japan, Monterrey, Mexico and SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil, none of them managed to strike the hearts and minds of tourists.

Roller coaster Super Grover's Vapor Trail, the Sky Splash water ride, and the "Rock Around the Block" musical parade all return for the 2007 season, as do other rides, shows, and physical play activities.

The park is open Friday through Sunday until 25 May, when the park begins opening daily. After Labor Day, Sesame Place is open weekends only until 27 October 2007.
