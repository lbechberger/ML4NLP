The body of Mike Seavers, a mountaineer who died in a climbing accident in the French Alps, has been found after seventeen years.

The 31 year-old, who lived in Bristol, was scaling Mont Blanc with a climbing party when they got caught up in a fierce storm. 

He was found alongside a German member of the party in a melting glacier which preserved their bodies, according to Nick Cotton from the British Mountaineering Council. “They may have gone inside a crevasse to take cover and got covered, possibly by an avalanche or snowfall. Glaciers are flowing things. They move at an imperceptible speed and anything travels with it encased in ice. When they get to a point where the glacier melts, things appear,” he said.
