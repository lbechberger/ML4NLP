Ferrari driver Felipe Massa won the FIA Formula One 2008 Grand Prix de France at the Circuit de Nevers Magny-Cours, France.

Though his teammate Kimi Räikkönen started from pole, Massa was able to get closer and overtake after a problem with exhaust lines onboard Räikkönen's car started.

Jarno Trulli did his best to withstand Heikki Kovalainen, McLaren Mercedes, pushing hard on him. Trulli made the first podium finish for Toyota team. This achievement was dedicated to the memory of Ove Andersson, team founder, who died in a rally crash recently.

BMW Sauber driver Robert Kubica, the previous GP winner, finished only 5th this time.

4 Renault-engined cars occupied the placeholders from 6 to 9th of the final protocol. Mark Webber gained 3 points for Red Bull. Fernando Alonso dropped to 8th place from the 3rd upon the start. His teammate Nelson Piquet Jr. passed Alonso on the closing laps of the race after a slight driving error by the Spaniard.

Lewis Hamilton qualified third but was penalized 10 places down the grid after his collision in the previous race. Soon after the start he made an error attacking Sebastian Vettel cutting the Nurburgring chicane and was penalized again by a drive-through penalty. He finished 10th.
