Earlier today in a twelfth round Australian Football League game played in rainy Sydney, the Richmond Tigers beat the expansion GWS Giants by a score of 11.20.86 to 12.2.74. 

Jeremy Cameron led the Giants in scoring with three goals. Rhys Palmer and Toby Greene each scored a pair of goals. Jonathon Patton, making his first appearance with the team, scored a goal. On the Tigers side, Daniel Connors led in scoring with three goals and one behind, while Jack Riewoldt also scored three goals.
