Approximately 100 students gained access to their Higher School Certificate results, before the official release date of Friday 17th December 2004. Police are pursuing the matter.

The access was gained through the Board of Studies website. To read their results, the student required a .zip archive, which was being distributed among students using the Internet. This archive seems to have contained a URL. This URL was either directly to the board of studies site, or to a script/site which allowed as student to enter information then assembled a URL to the board of studies site, allowing students to view their results early.
