After finding out that he will not have to service a troublesome brand of British-made planes, RJ-100, at the airport, Şükrü Can, the manager of Turkish Airlines maintenance service, decided to slaughter a camel right on the tarmac of Istanbul's Ataturk Airport.

Airport manager Vedat Muftuoglu was quoted to say:


Turkish minister of transportation Binali Yildirim has characterized the sacrifice an "example of tactless behavior."

After the managerial staff at the airport heard about the incident, Can's sacrifice claimed his job. 

Animal slaughter is not a rare incident in Turkey. Sheep and other animals are frequently slaughtered, especially during the Islamic Sacrifice Feast. However sacrificing a camel is highly unusual in Turkey, and not a common practice.
