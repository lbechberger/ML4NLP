Iran has successfully tested the Kowsar land-to-sea missile, and a "flying boat", Iran state media report.

According to the country's state television service, "A super-modern flying boat was successfully tested in the 'Great Prophet' war game in Persian Gulf waters. Because of its hull's advanced design, no radar at sea or in the air can locate it. It can lift out of the water. It is wholly domestically built and can launch missiles with precise targeting while moving."

Iran says that the Kowser missile can be used to sink enemy ships in the Gulf. Iran also announced that the missile's onboard systems could not be scrambled by enemy action.

Brian Whitman, a spokesman for the Pentagon in the United States, said, "We know that the Iranians are always trying to improve their weapons system by both foreign and indigenous measures. It's possible that they are increasing their capability and making strides in radar-absorbing materials and technology. [However] the Iranians have also been known to boast and exaggerate [in] their statements about greater technical and tactical capabilities."

On Friday, Iran tested its Fajr-3 missile, which Iran says can evade radar and can carry many warheads. On Monday, Iran tested in the Straits of Hormuz a torpedo that the country claims can evade sonar.

It is estimated that at least 1500 ships and aircraft, and at least 17,000 Iranian Revolutionary Guard troops, are participating in a week-long war games exercise in the Gulf.
