Series even at 1-1. (Best of Seven)




The Tampa Bay Lightning got back into the best-of-seven series, tonight, drawing even with the Devils at one game apiece. Vincent Lecavalier, Martin St. Louis, and Filip Kuba all scored for the Lightning. Offense plus sturdy goaltending by Johan Holmqvist equaled a win for the Lightning, which will return home to the St. Pete Times Forum for the next two games of the series.

Both Lecavalier and Devils center Zach Parise have three goals in the past two games.

Tampa and Jersey will face each other at least three more times in the opening round of the NHL Playoffs. The next meeting between the two clubs will be Monday, April 16, at 7:00 pm EDT, when the teams will meet again at the St. Pete Times Forum in Tampa, Florida.
