President Bush's highly controversial nominee to fill the seat of retiring Supreme Court justice Sandra Day O'Connor will have a chance to respond to congressional questions this week, with hearings scheduled for him to appear before the senate Judiciary Committee.

The 55 year old Samuel Alito has served as a federal appeals court judge for 15 years, and previously served as a lawyer for the Reagan administration.

His lengthy track record of more than 700 judicial opinions includes several writings on abortion-rights, among other issues, including statesâ€™ rights, first amendment rights, police rights, and the separation of church and state.
