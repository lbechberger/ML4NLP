A huge fire set the Armando museum in Amersfoort, Netherlands in flames around 1:00pm (local time). The museum was having a special exhibition and had borrowed many paintings from other museums and individuals. The museum was being worked on by painters, though there is no evidence that that was the cause.

Armando is a Dutch artist currently living in Germany. The collection of his work in the museum is estimated to have been worth roughly â‚¬3 million. The collection consisted mostly of paintings and statues.

The people living near the museum had been evacuated in case the fire spread beyond the buildings which had already caught fire. They were able to spend the night in the local city hall.
