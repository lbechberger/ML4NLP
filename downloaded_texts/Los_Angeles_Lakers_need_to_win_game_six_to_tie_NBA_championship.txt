The Los Angeles Lakers need to win tonight's 9:00 p.m. local time (0400 UTC) home game to stay in the 2010 NBA Finals. 

The Boston Celtics beat the Los Angeles Lakers 92â€“86 on Sunday in game five of the seven-game series. The Celtics may have underperformed over the season, but in these 2010 playoffs, they have been playing like the championship team they were two years ago. 

Though Kobe Bryant scored 38 points, there were no other other major point contributors from the Lakers. Pau Gasol scored twelve points, and Derek Fisher added nine points. The Celtics' Paul Pierce scored 27 points, and their other two "big three" players (Kevin Garnett and Ray Allen) scored 30 points between them, with Allen scoring 12 and Garnett adding 18. Rajon Rondo also had a good scoring game, contributing 18 points. 

For the final two games, if there are two games, the Lakers will have home-court advantage at Los Angeles' Staples Center. Kobe Bryant is a proven scorer, and Pau Gasol uses his size to pick out rebounds. The Celtics have the "big three" group of veteran players and also Rajon Rondo, a potential superstar. After the Celtic's win in game five, and a three-thousand mile journey back home, the Lakers find themselves needing to win tonight to tie the series and deny the Celtics the win they need to wrap up the 2010 championship.
