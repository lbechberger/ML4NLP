Today, Governor General of Canada MichaÃ«lle Jean issued a statement regarding International Women's Day. The day was first designated unofficially by some in the United States in 1909, to acknowledge the economic, political and social achievements of women. In 1975, during International Women's Year, the United Nations gave official sanction to the day, and began sponsoring events.
