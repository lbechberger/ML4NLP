The body of Emirati Sheikh Ahmed bin Zayed Al Nahyan has been found in a lake near Rabat, Morocco. Sheikh Ahmed had been missing since his glider plane crashed four days ago. 

Sheikh Ahmed was the managing director of the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority at the time of his death. He was the son of Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, and although he was the brother of Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed he was not in the immediate line for succession. 

The Spanish pilot survived the crash and is at the hospital in stable condition. Divers from several countries including Morocco, France, Spain, the United States, and the UAE all helped search for the missing Sheikh. The search had become more complicated after heavy rainfall over the weekend. 

Sheikh Ahmedâ€™s funeral will be held on Wednesday in Abu Dhabi.
