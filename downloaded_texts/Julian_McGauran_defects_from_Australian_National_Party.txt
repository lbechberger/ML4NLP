Australian National Party senator Julian McGauran left the party in order to join the Australian Liberal Party. McGauran has made comments to the effect of stating that the Liberals have the best chance of representing regional Australia.

The Prime Minister John Howard has said that McGauran was not "poached", over suspicions in relation to an upcoming frontbench reshuffle, and the Federal Treasurer Peter Costello welcomed McGauran's defection, with suspicion he may have orchestrated the move in order to bolster his leadership prospects. 

Many Nationals felt hurt; Victorian Nationals leader Peter Ryan called his move the "ultimate act of treachery".

His House of Representatives brother Peter McGauran remains in the National Party.
