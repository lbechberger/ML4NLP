Eight teens were shot Friday night outside a Gary, Indiana skating rink during a concert. According to Gary Police Cpl. Gabrielle King, "all chaos broke loose" when security asked patrons to leave after a fight broke out.

The wounded ranged from 14 to 18 years of age and were taken to three local hospitals with gunshot wounds to the legs, wrist, stomach, and back. The injuries were not life-threatening. Cpl. King said that the wounded were not clear on the motive for the shooting and that no arrests have been made. The shooting happened at Skate World, in the Commons shopping center at 4415 West 5th Avenue.

One victim said he was shot in the stomach by an African-American man holding a rifle, wearing a red hat and with dreadlocks. Two other victims said that security asked them to leave after a fight broke out. When they stepped outside, both were shot in the leg.
