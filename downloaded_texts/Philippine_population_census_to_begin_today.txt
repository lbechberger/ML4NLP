The Philippines National Statistics Office begins its twelfth population census today. Close to 40,000 enumerators will interview people in house-to-house visits to collect demographic data. 

The Population Census (POPCEN) 2007 will gather information on age, sex, marital status, education, and other demographic characteristics and is scheduled to last till August 25. 

All areas, ranging from exclusive subdivisions and condominiums to institutional populations such as those living in hospitals, sanitaria, penitentiary, military camps, convents, and seminaries will be covered, the NSO said in a press release. 

The population count by province, city, municipality and barangay is scheduled to be released on February 28, 2008. 

"The final count shall be considered official for all purposes upon proclamation by the President of the Philippines," the statement said.

NSO Administrator Carmelita N. Ericta urged the public to co-operate with the operation, "please allow our authorized census enumerators to take a few minutes of your time for the interview which will last for about 15 to 30 minutes."

The last census was taken in 2000. The NSO estimates the countryâ€™s population as of July 2005 as over 87 million.
