Justin Trudeau, the son of late former Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, will seek the federal Liberal party nomination to run for office in the riding of Papineau in Montreal, Quebec.

Trudeau, 35, will run in the next federal election, widely expected this spring, if the Liberal party accepts his nomination, a regular practice in Canada to run for office.

"I admire his courage and I encourage him," said Liberal leader Stéphane Dion. "It's not going to be easy."

"It's an absolute bonus that I'll be able to take back this riding for the Liberals," Trudeau told the CBC.

Pierre Trudeau, who was Canada's PM for 16-years straight, died at age 80 in 2000. His son is an avid speaker and supported Gerard Kennedy for leadership of the Liberal party. Kennedy backed out to support eventual winner Stéphane Dion and Trudeau did the same.

Bloc Québécois' Vivian Barbot is the current MP for the riding. Papineau is known as the poorest riding in Canada with an average annual household income of CAN$34,380. It is also the smallest riding in Canada.
