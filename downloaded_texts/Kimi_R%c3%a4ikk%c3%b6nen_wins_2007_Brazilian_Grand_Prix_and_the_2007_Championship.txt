Ferrari driver Kimi Räikkönen wins the FIA Formula-1 2007 Grande Prêmio do Brasil at Autódromo José Carlos Pace, São Paulo, Brazil. Iceman smiled on the first place of the podium as the 2007 Championship in full went to his team. Finally, the highly controversial and enthralling 2007 season came to an unexpected close. It was Ferrari who catched the Constructors' championship at Belgian Grand Prix from McLaren team and now ended their drivers domination.

The weekend starts by Felipe Massa won the pole position, proving himself able to win his home race for the second time since 2006. McLaren Mercedes driver Lewis Hamilton showed second result aiming to secure his first place in the championship.

Still, the start became just a first nuisance for Lewis, when Massa and Kimi together closed the gate for him and in the next turn his teammate Fernando Alonso obviously denied Lewis to pass him, and the English driver went out in the field. Lewis rolled back, but after eight laps suffered a bigger problem with his gearbox losing even more positions.

It became clear by that time that not only Fernando, but even Kimi, has a chance to win the season. The possibly last word was said by Massa, who returned from second pit stop to give up the lead to Kimi. Some flying laps by the Finn and he secured his win of the race.

Lewis was also flying though. Like Michael Schumacher chasing Alonso in 2006 he overtook a number of drivers as McLaren changed his flight plan to three pit stops. But this was actually not enough to prevent Kimi of winning the season with 110 points, only 1 crucial point ahead both Alonso and Hamilton (109 pts).

The closing stages of the race saw a battle of Nico Rosberg's Williams-Toyota car with both BMW Sauber, German driver stayed in front of Robert Kubica and Nick Heidfeld.

Lewis finished only 7th in one lap behind the leader. Top eight closed by Jarno Trulli's Toyota, last driver who was overtaken by no more a rooky Hamilton.
