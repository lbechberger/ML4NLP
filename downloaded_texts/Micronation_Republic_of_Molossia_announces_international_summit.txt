On March 18, President Kevin Baugh of the Republic of Molossia, a micronation located in Nevada, announced that his country would hold its first ever international summit this June.

Grand Prince Christopher I and Princess Erin of the Principality of Vikesland, another micronation located in Canada, will be attending.

Besides the meeting itself, which is scheduled to take place in Molossia's capital city, Espera, President Baugh is to give them a tour of his country as well as the surrounding areas. He is looking forward to the event and hopes that it may "open the way to future visits between Molossia and the other small nations of the world."

The Republic of Molossia and Principality of Vikesland are not recognized by any major countries or international organizations. However, both are by other micronations.

Earlier this month, Wikinews held an interview with President Baugh.
