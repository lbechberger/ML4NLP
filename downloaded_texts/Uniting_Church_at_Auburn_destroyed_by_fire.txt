The Uniting Church at Auburn in Sydney's inner west has been destroyed by fire overnight.

According to a press release by New South Wales Police, police and fire brigade personnel arrived at the church at approximately 1:35 a.m. local time to discover the church well alight.

Around 30 firefighters fought the blaze for two hours before bringing it under control.

The church is located near an Islamic centre and police are not sure if the fire is linked to the racial violence in Sydney over the past two days. Police are treating the fire as suspicious and will be continuing their investigations today.
