Seattle based soccer club Seattle Sounders FC 2 (S2) lost their initial two away games of the season despite having entered the road trip undefeated with three wins. First, they played the Tulsa Roughnecks who won 4–3 on Thursday. Next, S2 traveled to nearby Oklahoma City to battle Energy FC on Saturday but lost 2–1.

The first half of the game against Tulsa was very exciting with five goals within the first twenty five minutes. Gibson Bardley scored immediately (2') for the Roughnecks. This prompted two quick goals from Qudus Lawal who scored two along (9', 10') to put the Sounders back in the lead. Eli Galbraith-Knapp scored for the opposition in the 19th minute to bring the teams level but Jimmy Ockford (25') notched one shortly after to give the Sounders three goals before the half. After the break, the Roughnecks were able to keep the Sounders from scoring but pulled ahead with two goals of their own from Steven Miller (69') and Lucas Cordeiro (77').

The Sounders struck first in the game against the Energy with a goal from Darwin Jones in the 33rd minute. This was a short-lived lead, however, with Oklahoma City scoring five minutes later with a goal from Chuy Sanchez. Energy FC might have led going into the half when they were awarded a penalty kick but Michael Thomas was unable to convert. The Sounders almost held on for a draw but Danni König scored in the 86th minute.

S2 next faces the Vancouver Whitecaps 2 away while the Roughnecks are to travel to Kentucky to face Louisville City FC. The Energy are to host Saint Louis FC.
