Car and suicide bombs killed at least 63 people within a single hour near markets in an area called "New Baghdad" and in Sadr City, Iraq.



The two car bombs were detonated near marketplaces and bus stops in al-Jadida at 3:00 PM local time. Another was detonated near a security checkpoint. At least 134 people were wounded in the attack.

A news release from the United States Army forces in Iraq said that troops helped 327 families displaced by the bombings to safe locations. During a search of a building, troops found three pistols, two AK-47s, eight women, and at least 23 children.

Major General Joseph F. Fil said that he believes that the insurgents are "...watching us carefully," to determine their next move.
