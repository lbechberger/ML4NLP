Canada has become the first western country to freeze aid and cut diplomatic ties to Palestine after the Palestinian Legislative Council installed a government led by Hamas. No other country has yet followed through on threats to end aid to the Palestinian Authority. Aid may still go to Palestine through the United Nations.

The Canadian Arab Federation head, Faraj Nakhleh, later expressed his dismay at the decision, which he says will harm the interests of the 3.5 million Palestinians who are at risk of starvation.
