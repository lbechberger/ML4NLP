Yesterday the Prime Minister of New Zealand, Helen Clark, presented song writer, Don McGlashan with his second Silver Scroll at an exclusive awards ceremony. The song that won him the prestigious APRA music award was the hit song Bathe in the River, which featured in the hit New Zealand movie No. 2 sung by Wellington singer, Hollie Smith.

McGlashan won his first Silver Scroll in 1994 for his song Anchor Me when he was with the band The Mutton Birds.

Anthony Healey, APRA New Zealand Director, said: "Bathe in the River is a song that captures the hearts and emotions of everyone who hears it. All Don's music is emotive and powerful and this song is no exception. ...Absolute classic."

There were four other songs that were finalists in the award that is based on songwriting, not record sales. One other song that was written by McGlashan was a finalist.

Other winners at the ceremony were:
*Richard Bennett was presented with the Maioha Award at the Silver Scroll ceremony for his waiata E Hine (waiata is the MÄ�ori term for song and singing).
*Ross Harris's song Symphony No. 2 won the Sounz Contemporary award for the third time. Harris said: "[It] is intended to convey the terrible sadness of the man-made hell of war."
*James Reid for the single Stand Up which was the most performed work in New Zealand.
*Neil Finn took the award, once again, for the most performed work overseas.

Evermore were nominated this year after winning the award last year.
