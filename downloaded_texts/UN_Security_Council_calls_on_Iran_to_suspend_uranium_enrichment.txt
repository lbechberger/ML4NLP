The U.N. Security Council has unanimously approved a non-binding statement earlier today reaffirming its commitment to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NTP), including the right of NTP states to "develop research, production and use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes without discrimination", and also calling for Iran to temporarily suspend this right — including all activities related to uranium enrichment and reprocessing, including research and development activities — in order to "build confidence in the exclusively peaceful purpose of its nuclear programme and to resolve outstanding questions".

The five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council agreed on the statement earlier today. This is the first action by the Security Council over the alleged fears of some countries that Iran wants to join the growing list of nations possessing nuclear weapons.

The Security Council requested that in addition to the International Atomic Energy Agency's ongoing inspections in Iran, that it monitor Iran's compliance with "the steps required by the IAEA Board". Russia and China, two members of the Security Council, have stated opposition to using force or imposing sanctions on Iran.

The IAEA was requested to file a report in thirty days' time.
