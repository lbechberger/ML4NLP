A poll conducted by Colmar Brunton on behalf of TV One released yesterday, showed that the New Zealand Labour Party had slipped two percent to 36%. The New Zealand National Party is leading with 49%, a gap of 13%. But acting Prime Minister, Michael Cullen, is brushing this poll off saying that the Colmar Brunton polls are always siding for National and there are two years until the next election.

The gap is the biggest it has been since the leader, Don Brash, of National made a speech about race relations in 2004 at Orewa which was hugely popular.

Cullen said: "Clearly the poll reflected the government legislation last week validating the unlawful spend by political parties in the lead up to last year's election. The poll was taken right at the time the legislation was being passed under urgency through parliament so a hit was expected."

However Prime Minister (PM) Helen Clark, is still leading as the preferred PM on 33% and Don Brash on 17%. Finance spokesman for National has been rumoured to take over Brash's job, John Key, has risen to 11%, the biggest support it has ever been.

Support for National has not changed on 49%, and the Greens is remaining on six percent. The Greens, National and Labour are the only parties to have broken the five percent threshold required in Mixed Member Proportional (MMP).

New Zealand First is up two percent on three percent. Maori Party went down one percent and is now on two percent. Both ACT and United Future are on one percent.
