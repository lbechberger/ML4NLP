Investigations into claims of sexual abuse by the former television presenter, and , Jimmy Savile are expanding to cover an additional 19 hospitals in the United Kingdom, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt announced Friday. Hunt told Parliament, in a written statement, the investigation around Savile's access through the health service are now to report by June next year.

The announcement brings the total number of hospitals being investigated for links with sexual abuse allegations made against Savile to 32. Metropolitan Police are continuing their inquiries into Savile, stating: "Inquiries are ongoing, and we continue to work with the Department of Health. Inquiries into criminal offences are not concluded yet".

About a year after Savile's death in October 2011, ITV broadcast a documentary where several women claim to have been sexually abused by the former TV star. Since then, many more people have come forward with statements claiming abuse by Savile. In addition, a number of other celebrities and public figures have been arrested in connection with claims of sexual abuse and rape.

Solicitor Jessica Standley, whose law firm represents about 70 of Savile's alleged victims, said of the news: "What is concerning me is that the Department of Health have taken until now to include those additional hospitals".

Brian Tooke, a former nurse at the now closed De La Pole Hospital in Willerby, said: "I was appalled when I heard it all â€” they are vulnerable people and should be protected. I can't understand how, if it is true, he would have been allowed to have free run and exploit vulnerable people."
