U.S. presidential candidate Mike Huckabee won Saturday's GOP caucuses in Kansas and Louisiana, CNN reported earlier. Huckabee, a former minister and governor of Arkansas, trailed party frontrunner John McCain by nearly 500 delegates at the beginning of the day. Kansas has pledged 36 delegates to the winner of today's contest.

Just days after winning several key states in the Super Tuesday showdown, Huckabee has again demonstrated his ability to compete with McCain, the presumptive Republican nominee. Since Tuesday's surge, McCain has come under fire from various leaders of the conservative wing of his party. Some feel McCain can shore up his conservative flank by naming Huckabee his running mate for the general election in November. McCain has repeatedly called for conservative former governor Mitt Romney to meet and work with him.

Though Romney, Huckabee's chief rival among conservative voters, suspended his campaign on Thursday, Huckabee says he has no plans to give McCain a clear path to the Republican nomination. Including Kansas, he has finished first in seven races this primary season.

According to CNN, Huckabee spoke at a Conservative Political Action Conference in Washington, D.C. this morning and said, "I know the pundits, and I know what they say: The math doesn't work out. Well, I didn't major in math, I majored in miracles. And I still believe in those, too."
