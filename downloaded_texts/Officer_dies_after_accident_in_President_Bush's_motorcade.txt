A police officer was killed after a motorcycle accident in Albuquerque, New Mexico. The officer, forty-year-old Germaine Casey, was driving his motorcycle in a motorcade as President Bush was leaving the city heading to the Albuquerque Airport following a fund raiser for Senator Pete Domenici.

The vehicle was traveling at a high speed when it hit a curb, then crashed into a tree. Casey was taken to Albuquerque Hospital where he was pronounced dead. President Bush passed the accident scene on his way out of Albuquerque. Bush issued a statement thanking the officer for his service. 

Trish Hoffman, of the Albuquerque Police Department, said the single vehicle crash was under investigation and that it was still too soon to pinpoint a cause.
