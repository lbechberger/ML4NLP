The Space Shuttle Discovery has returned to the Kennedy Space Center in Florida.

The 109 ton vehicle was flown back from Edwards Airforce Base (AFB) in California on top of a modified Boeing 747 known as the Shuttle Carrier Aircraft. The 3,591 km journey across the United States took 2 days and cost about one million dollars. The Shuttle Carrier Aircraft made pit-stops in Oklahoma and Louisiana before landing in Florida this morning.

On its way back from space, Discovery had to land at Edwards AFB on August 9 because its homebase in Florida reported bad weather.
