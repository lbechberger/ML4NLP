Three soldiers of the Italian part of NATO's mission in Afghanistan, ISAF, were injured while their helicopter was performing an emergency landing. The Italian Ministry of Defence reported that the soldiers are not in a serious condition, and they are currently hospitalized at a French field hospital in the Afghan capital, Kabul.

The helicopter, an AB-212 with seven on board, was forced to make an emergency landing because of technical malfunction, 21 km south east of Kabul.
