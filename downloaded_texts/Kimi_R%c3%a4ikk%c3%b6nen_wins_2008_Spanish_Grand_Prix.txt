Ferrari driver Kimi Räikkönen won the FIA Formula One 2008 Gran Premio de España Telefónica at Circuit de Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain. Both Ferrari drivers were on the podium, with Ferrari's Felipe Massa finishing right after his teammate.

Fernando Alonso's Renault couldn't maintain the high pace. Having started from second place after Räikkönen, the car's engine failed midway through the race.

McLaren Mercedes drivers took the third row in qualification, but Heikki Kovalainen suffered a full speed crash into a wall of tyres during the race. The driver was evacuated to the hospital and is reported to be 'in stable condition'.

His teammate Lewis Hamilton gained third place after the two Ferraris, having qualified in fifth place.

Robert Kubica earned 5 points for BMW Sauber finishing immediately after Hamilton.

The rest of the cars to finish did so more than 30 seconds after Räikkönen.
