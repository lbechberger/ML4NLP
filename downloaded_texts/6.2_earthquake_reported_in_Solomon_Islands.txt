A magnitude 6.2 earthquake has struck in the Solomon Islands, the United States Geological Survey reports.

The quake was centered roughly 53 km (33 miles) NW (313Â°) from Gizo, Solomon Islands and occurred at 06:34:46 (UTC) but no tsunami warning has been issued and there are no reports of any damage.

This follows a magnitude 8.1 undersea earthquake three days ago that triggered a tsunami that killed at least fifteen people, including six children, in the Solomon Islands. A series of aftershocks have shaken the area since then. A smaller 6.0 magnitude quake was reported at 8:39:44 PM (EDT) and on Monday, two quakes of magnitudes 6.0 and 6.2 quake struck the same area, the second 70 km (45 miles) South East of Gizo, New Georgia Islands, Solomon Islands.
