In a true sign of the times, a mobile phone ringtone has topped the UK singles chart. The Crazy Frog ringtone, long marketed to children and teenagers was last week launched as a single - and promptly proved more popular than both Coldplay's comeback release, Speed of Sound and last weeks number one by Oasis.

The song, if it can be called that, is a variation of the hugely popular Crazy Frog ringtone remixed with Axel F - the theme tune from the 1980s film Beverly Hills Cop which starred Eddie Murphy.

The Crazy Frog ringtone has been marketed in Britain, and throughout Europe, by German firm Jamster! It is primarily marketed by multiple TV adverts on music channels which are targeted at teenagers and kids.
