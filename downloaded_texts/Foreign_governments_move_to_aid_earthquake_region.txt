After facing criticism for being slow to act and initially giving too little after the December 26 Indonesian earthquake and tsunami, the United States government was quick to act when a massive earthquake hit Indonesia again March 28. U.S. State Department Adam Ereli said under orders of President George W. Bush, American embassy officials have been in contact with both Indonesia officials and the International Red Cross to coordinate international relief efforts and other foreign aid.

The two former U.S. presidents, Bill Clinton and the current president's father, George H.W. Bush, already are heading up U.S. aid efforts in the region as the result of the last major temblor. "We still have people over there assisting from the first one, and they will be our first line of defense, once we know what kind of damage there is," Pat McCrummen, spokesman for the American Red Cross told the Associated Press.

Although relief officials have been in contact with various governments, no specific pledge amount has been announced (as of 20:51, 28 Mar 2005 (UTC)).
