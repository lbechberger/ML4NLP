After two games into the season, the Minnesota Twins are the sole leader of the American League Central division, something they couldn't accomplish last year until an hour after their final game ended. The Twins, now 2-0, defeated the Baltimore Orioles Tuesday night at the Metrodome. The Twins played offensively, stealing five bases in the night, and tomorrow will attempt at a sweep of the three-game series.

Twins starter Boof Bonser pitched six innings, giving up three hits and two runs with six strikeouts. Pat Neshek pitched one inning with one strikeout. Juan Rincon pitched a third of an inning, giving up one hit with one strikeout. Dennys Reyes pitched a third of an inning, giving up one hit. Jesse Crain pitched a third of an inning with one strikeout. Joe Nathan picked up his second save with one strikeout.

Orioles starter Daniel Cabrera pitched seven innings, giving up six hits and three runs with nine strikeouts. Jamie Walker pitched two thirds of an inning, giving up one hit with one strikeout. Chad Bradford pitched a third of an inning.

Baltimore struck first, with Melvin Mora hitting a solo home run in the top of the third. Later in the third inning, Oriole Aubrey Huff hit an RBI single to score Nick Markakis from second base.

Orioles shortstop Miguel Tejada made an amazing defensive play in the fourth inning, diving to grab a line drive and setting up a double play. The same play also led to the Twins' first run with Nick Punto scoring on the sacrifice. The Twins tied the game in the fifth when Luis Castillo hit to the pitcher, but the ball bounced out of Cabrera's glove, scoring Torii Hunter from third base. The tie would remain until the seventh inning when Jason Bartlett hit a single to left, scoring Jason Tyner from second base.
