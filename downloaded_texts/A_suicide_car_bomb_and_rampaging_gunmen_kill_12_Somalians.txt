At least 12 people were killed after a roadside bomb went off next to a hotel so gunmen could storm in and shoot in Mogadishu, Somali capital. Al-Shabaab, a Somalia based militant Islamist group and al Qaeda’s affiliate claimed responsibility, claiming the group was the ones who infiltrated the hotel after the explosion. The Mogadishu hotel is said to be popular with Somalia’s members of Government. 

Among the victims were MP and general who led the 2012 offensive that drove al-Shabaab out of Mogadishu and the hotel owner Gen Abdikarim Dhagabadan, who commanded the operation. 

The Islamist group have carried out a number of attacks on hotels in Somali’s capital and are known to use car bombs driven by suicide bombers to blast a building so gunmen can then storm in on foot. 

The attack follows a brutal fight the day before between African Union troops and jihadist fighters in the Bakool region near the border with Ethiopia. Militant group al-Shabaab attacks Somalia’s capital and neighboring countries regularly. Killing almost 150 people at a University in Kenya in April.
