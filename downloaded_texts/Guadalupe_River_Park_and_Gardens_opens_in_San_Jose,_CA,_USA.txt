The city of San Jose, California greeted the opening of the Guadalupe River Park and Gardens today with festivities, music, and dancing. Local organizations and businesses offered booths and activities for the crowd.


Themed "A park for many reasons, a park for all seasons", the opening marked the culmination of 12 years of building, at a cost of $340 million. With trails running 2.6 miles along the Guadalupe River, the park offers an open space for city residents, preserves habitat for local wildlife, and works in conjunction with local flood control projects. 

Planning for the park began in 1985 and construction continues to extend the trails along the lower Guadalupe River to Alviso by 2006.
