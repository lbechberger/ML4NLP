The discussion on the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007, which, if passed, would result in a temporary worker program, was put back on the political agenda. The Senate voted 64â€“35, which, though not sufficient to pass the bill, was enough to resume debate on the subject.

President Bush has been working to get the bill back into the agenda, making a trip to Capitol Hill to "twist a few arms" according to CNN. He also gave a speech on the subject on Tuesday morning. 

The bill faces stiff opposition from Republicans in Congress, who say that "it would do little to stem the flow of illegal immigration into the United States."

President Bush spoke about the issue, saying that, "I view this as a historic opportunity for Congress to act... This is a moment for people who have been elected to come together, focus on a problem and show the American people we can fix a problem."
