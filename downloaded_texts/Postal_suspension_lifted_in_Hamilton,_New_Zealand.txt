The two-day postal delivery suspension placed on three streets in Hamilton, New Zealand has been lifted by New Zealand Post and the posties are back to work delivering mail.

The suspension of deliveries applied to Tennyson Road, Dryden Road, and Emerson Place, which are located in Fairfield. New Zealand Post came to the decision on Friday to put the ban in place because of recent gang violence/conflict. Along with the New Zealand Police, New Zealand Post reviewed the current situation, and also drove along the streets, they came to the conclusion that the situation has now "cooled down," according to New Zealand Post spokesperson, Fiona Mayo and postal delivery general manger, Matthew Nant.

The residents on those streets came out to greet the postie, who was accompanied by business leader Brendon Coker, as she delivered the residents mail. Martha Rollo, Tennyson Road resident for 13-years, said that she was thrilled that her mail was once again being delivered after the "senseless" gang violence had temporarily stopped post. "Why should the rest of the locals suffer because of the gangs. We don't need this hassle." Ms Rollo said that the gang activity has only recently happened.

Vicky Roughan and Kevin Roughan, 12-year residents of Dryden Road, said that the post suspension, vandalism, and gang activity has been a problem for them. Mr Roughan claims that children from the age of nine and up are drinking late at night. "You don't know what the hell's going to happen."

Mr Nant has apologised to the affected, inconvenienced residents.

New Zealand Post state they are going to continue to monitor the situation, however and also have on-going discussion with the local council and police "to make sure we're abreast of any developments in the area."

The gang violence/activity New Zealand Post are referring to is, on the previous Thursday the Armed Offenders Squad was called out where they raided three homes following a shooting, eight people were arrested, and a large number of firearms were seized.

Despite post not being delivered, newspapers were still being delivered, waste collection was still happening, and electricity meter readers were also going around house to house, checking the meters.

MÄ�ori Party co-leader, Doctor Pita Sharples, has said that gangs are again starting to imping on on society like in the 1970s. He says we should include gangs into society, instead of disrupting them.
