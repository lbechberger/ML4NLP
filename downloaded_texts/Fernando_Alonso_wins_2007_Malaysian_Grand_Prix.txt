McLaren-Mercedes drivers Fernando Alonso and Lewis Hamilton placed first and second in the FIA Formula One 2007 Petronas Malaysian Grand Prix on the Sepang International Circuit, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.

From the start to the end of the race, the two "silver arrows" held the lead against their competitors from Ferrari. Alonso created a comfortable gap, while Hamilton held off Felipe Massa and Kimi Räikkönen. Massa pushed very hard on the rookie, who was driving in only his second race, trying to overtake him, but made a crucial mistake before the first pit-stop and found himself off the track. Massa finally finished fifth, behind Nick Heidfeld, a BMW Sauber team driver. Räikkönen showed much more careful driving than Massa, finishing third.

Giancarlo Fisichella, driving for Renault, came sixth,
with his young teammate Heikki Kovalainen eighth. Jarno Trulli, from Toyota, split the two Renaults in seventh.

Alexander Wurz, from Williams-Toyota, finished ninth, while his teammate, Nico Rosberg, who had been driving in sixth place, retired following the second round of pit stops due to engine failure.

Mark Webber, from Red Bull-Renault, completed the top ten, making his first finish in the Malaysian Grand Prix, following retirements in his 5 previous seasons.
