A Federal Air Marshal decided to exit a Southwest Airlines flight today after dropping ammunition on the aircraft floor. The incident occurred at Chicago’s Midway Airport.

After earlier arriving from Philadelphia, the Marshal was on board a Southwest Airlines jet bound for Kansas City, when his gun’s clip fell to the aircraft floor, spilling bullets. According to Southwest Airlines spokeswomen Whitney Eichenger "He picked up the bullets immediately." She also added, "Since he was no longer traveling incognito, he decided not to continue on the flight to Kansas City."

Because of the incident, the flight was delayed 45 minutes.
