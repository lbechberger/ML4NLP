Hamas, the current government controlling Gaza and a labeled as a "foreign terrorist organization" by the United States, is claiming that the Israel Defense Forces are preparing for an incursion into Gaza, and they are preparing for any such attempt, performing military exercises and drills to "surprise" Israeli forces with "ferocious fighting." Hamas says that Israel is planning to attack after several rockets were fired into populated cities the southern portion of Israel from Hamas controlled portions of the strip.

"Your brothers, the sons of Hamas ... have the weapons that they claimed as booty from the war of cleansing (of Fatah) and will now fight the state of Israel with them," said Nizar Rayyan a senior Hamas government official in a statement who also added that they would kidnap any Israeli soldiers attempting an attack on the government or the city.

Drills and exercises including training their forces in handling and firing rocket launchers and automatic rifles. They also train in "taking cover" and wear camouflage outfits. An abandoned building was also blown up in a controlled explosion.

Israeli officials don't deny that any military action is not part of possible plans to stop the rocket fire into the country, but also say that there are several other plans to try and stop rocket attacks.

"I think there are a series of actions other than military actions," said Tzipi Livni, the Foreign Minister of Israel.

Some plans include stopping supplies such as water and fuel from going into Gaza, and shutting off the gas and electricity to homes and businesses in the attempt to stop attacks.
