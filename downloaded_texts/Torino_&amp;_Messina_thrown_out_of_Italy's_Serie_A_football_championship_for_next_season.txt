Torino and Messina are facing the risk of expulsion from Serie A because of fraud. Both clubs submitted false financial information to the Serie A management.

Covisoc, the body who must ratify that all clubs have the funds necessary to be registered for the new season, have found problems with both outfits.

As it stands now, they are not part of the Italian First Division but the pair have submitted an appeal on July 12 against the initial decision.

A final verdict on whether the clubs can compete in the top-flight next term is expected on July 15.

Numerous other clubs in lower Divisions are facing similar problems, with Perugia and Salernitana risking demotion from Serie B. A total of 20 clubs are in trouble in Serie C.
