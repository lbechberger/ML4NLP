Kathmandu, the capital of the Asian country of Nepal, has been shut down after former Maoist rebels called a strike to protest to the alleged killing of one of their leaders.

Businesses, schools, and factories closed down on Monday, when members of the Young Communist League (YCL) entered city intersections to enforce the strike. Vehicles of drivers who have defied the strike have been torched and vandalised.

The protests and strikes come several days after local Maoist leader Rajendra Phuyal was found dead in the country's capital on June 11. The rebels suspect that he had been killed, and want an investigation into the incident.
