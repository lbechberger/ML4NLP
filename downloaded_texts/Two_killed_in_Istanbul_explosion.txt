Two were killed and at least four were injured in Thursday's explosion in Pendik, eastern Istanbul suburb, Turkey. Some media reported that the blast occurred in a trash bin, while others say that it occurred in a moving vehicle.

A 21-year-old woman and her mother died in the blast. It is still unknown who is responsible.

This was the last of a series of explosions in Turkey, and trash bins have already been used for bombing. A similar explosion happened in Antalya on Tuesday, when two smaller explosions wounded nine people.

Other tourist resorts have been targeted as well. In July, mini-bus bombing killed five in Kusadasi, and 20 were injured when a bomb in a dustbin exploded in Cesme.
