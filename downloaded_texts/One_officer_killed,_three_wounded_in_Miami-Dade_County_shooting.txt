A manhunt in southeastern Florida has begun after four Miami-Dade Police Department officers were shot with a high-powered rifle. One of those officers has died. Two others are in serious condition. One has been released from Homestead Hospital.

"Shortly after 11:21 a.m. Thursday, Miami-Dade police officers from the Cutler Ridge district were in a development conducting a burglary surveillance detail. They saw a vehicle driving erratically. They stopped the vehicle and attempted to question the driver. The subject got out of the vehicle and started to shoot at officers," said Linda O'Brien, the media relations bureau commander. "This man is armed and dangerous."

The suspect in the shooting is 25-year-old Shawn Sherwin Labeet, of Margate. Labeet has a warrant for his arrest with the charge of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon. 

Police had blocked off I-95 ramps to Southwest 10th Street in Deerfield Beach to search a Publix distribution center. 

Police began a search for a black 2007 four-door Pontiac Vibe with Florida license tag number W59 EBT. They believed that Labeet was traveling with a woman and two children. The police detained the car in question in a parking lot at an Oakland Park Target. The driver of the vehicle was not the suspect.

Several hundred police officers between Florida Highway Patrol, the Broward County Police Department, and the Miami Dade Police Department are focusing their attention on finding Labeet.
