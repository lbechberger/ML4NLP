A CNN news program, The Situation Room, today reported that George W. Bush's job approval rating has dropped to 31 percent, with 63 percent disapproving of the job he is doing.

The Situation Room also reported that leaders of Iran and Syria have said that if the president were to ask for help from them, "...all their problems will be solved." 

President Bush has not yet responded to the announcement made by the leaders of Iran and Syria, but The Situation Room said that Bush should definitely "take the deal".
