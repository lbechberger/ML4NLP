Queensland election candidates running for electorates on the Gold Coast have backed the concept of daylight saving.

"I'm quite happy to offer my personal position which is a split zone from Noosa to the border," said Liberal National Party candidate Ray Stevens. "This is not an LNP policy for the state but it's my personal position."

An unnamed spokesperson of Lawrence Springborg ruled out daylight saving altogether. "Absolutely not," he said.

Christina Landis had a similar position within the Australian Labor Party. "I think it would be a benefit for the Gold Coast. It is a difficult situation for businesses and I understand that," she said.

"Daylight saving is the elephant in the room," said Daylight Saving for South East Queensland (DS4SEQ) founder Jason Furze. "We waste billions of dollars every year by not having daylight saving."

Mr Furze told Wikinews in January that DS4SEQ is proposing a dual time zone for Queensland which "is a well thought out compromise to the current situation that obviously does not work."

Gold Coast Central Chamber of Commerce president has said the daylight saving was an issue for local businesses. "Daylight saving costs business money. It would have a great flow-on effect for businesses like golf courses and other tourism operators to be able to take advantage of extra sunshine," he said.
