Lance Armstrong, seven-time Tour de France champion and partner of singer Sheryl Crow, has criticized Tour director Jean-Marie LeBlanc for his comments that next year's race will be more exciting without him. LeBlanc said Thursday, "It is a change of era. A period of long domination is over. The path is open. It is an exciting time."

On Saturday night, Armstrong hosted NBC's satirical TV show Saturday Night Live, making light of the allegations. During the opening of the show, Armstrong said: "The last time I did something too good, the French started testing my urine every 15 minutes!" Armstrong's Fiancee, Sheryl Crow, also appeared on the show.
