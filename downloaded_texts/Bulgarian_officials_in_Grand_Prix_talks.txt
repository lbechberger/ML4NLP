Rumen Petkov, the chief of the Bulgarian Motorycling federation has been invited by Bernie Ecclestone, the Formula One boss, to discuss plans for a Bulgarian Grand Prix to be added to the Formula One calendar in 2011.

The talks will be held during the German Grand Prix at the NÃ¼rburgring next weekend. If the bid is successful, the new circuit is likely to be located near Pleven.

The president of Bulgaria's Automobile Sport Federation, Georgi Yankulov is said to be lacking opitimism regarding the bid due to the current recession creating problems attracting sponsors and constructing a circuit.

It was announced in 2008 that the Indian Grand Prix will be added to the 2011 calendar, delayed from its intended 2010 debut.
