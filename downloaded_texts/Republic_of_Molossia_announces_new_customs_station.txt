On May 11, President Kevin Baugh of the Republic of Molossia, a micronation located near Dayton, Nevada, inaugurated his country's first ever customs station near the border with the United States, in the capital city of Espera.

It was built after Baugh noticed that the tiny nation had no welcoming spot for its visitors. Though the station is unmanned as of now, there are plans for a customs officer to be stationed there in the near future. A sign asks that foreigners leave their pocket change as an entry fee.

Several items are banned in Molossia, including firearms, tobacco and incandescent light bulbs. The customs station was designed to ensure that these are not illegally brought into the country from the United States.
