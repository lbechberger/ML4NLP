Barbra Streisand was heckled during a concert on Monday night in New York City inside Madison Square Garden after doing a comedy sketch, impersonating the United States President, George W. Bush portraying him as a "bumbling idiot."

Some of the audience members did not like her sketch and began to heckle the singer, causing Streisand to ask "Come on, be polite!" during her sketch.

One audience member refused to stop and Streisand told him off.

"Shut the fuck up! Shut up if you can't take a joke!" said Streisand.

The heckler was then asked to leave the concert. There is no word on who the heckler was.

Streisand is currently making her first 16 city tour after nearly 12 years.
