Clark Rockefeller, a former director of the Algonquin Club in Boston, Massachusetts, has allegedly abducted his 7-year-old daughter, Reigh Boss, during a supervised weekend visit. The weekend visit was supervised by a social worker, and Rockefeller got away in a black SUV, affixed with Red Sox stickers, driven by another man.

Authorities believe that Rockefeller might try to escape to Bermuda from New York City on his recently purchased yacht, "Serenity". The New York City Police Department, Coast Guard, and the FBI searched the area around New York City and Long Island for the yacht.

Massachusetts State Police issued an Amber Alert for Reigh on Sunday, but canceled it Monday after New York Police said that Rockefeller was last seen at 7:30pm Sunday at Grand Central Station.
