University of Miami head football coach Larry Coker was fired today after a five win, five loss season. 

He was fired after a disappointing season which was filled with conterversy and tragedy. On October 14th, a brawl in a game against Florida International University led to the suspension of 13 UM players. On November 7th, starting defensive lineman Bryan Pata was shot and killed outside his apartment in Kendall. The Hurricanes also went though a four game losing streak.

"We have suffered disappointments and tragedy off and on the field," University of Miami President Donna Shalala said in a statement regarding Coker's firing. "We can and will do better."

Coker firing came one day after a 17-14 win over 17th ranked Boston College. Coker may coach one more game if the Hurricanes get selected for a bowl game. University of Rutgers head coach Greg Schiano and former University of Wisconsin coach Barry Alvarez has emerged as one of the top candidates.
