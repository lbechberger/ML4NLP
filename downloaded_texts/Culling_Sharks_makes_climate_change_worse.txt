According to lead researcher from the Australian Research Council Dr Peter Macreadie, the rise in shark culling to try to reduce the number of shark attacks has found the apex predators play a very important role in helping prevent climate change. Further down the food chain in the marine environment are mangroves, which are the most powerful carbon stores in the world. A process called biosequestration has brought the carbon that has been released into the airs atmosphere and sealed it deep into the earth’s soil around the mangroves. 

With less sharks in the ocean it is now teeming with the predator’s prey, turtles, string rays and crabs. With an over abundance of these animals, the ecosystems surrounding are being eaten at an alarming rate. Causing the release of ancient carbon to be unleashed back into the atmosphere. The domino effect of removing an animal from a food web causes a detrimental effect on the environment, even if it is a predator.
