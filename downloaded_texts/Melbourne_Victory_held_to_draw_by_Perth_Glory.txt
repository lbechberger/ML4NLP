Nearly 15,000 people turned up to Olympic Stadium Melbourne to see the home side Melbourne Victory being held to a draw by the visiting Perth Glory in their round 16 A-League match last night.

Victory where without captain Kevin Muscat who was out serving a ban from Victory's previous game against Sydney FC. Archie Thompson wore the captain's armband for the night for Victory.

In the first game under Alan Vest, Perth's Glory came in strong and held long to pull the tie from the Victory.

The lead goal came from Damian Mori for the Glory 5 minutes in, answered by Thompson and Daniel Allsop to give Victory a lead 2-1 at half. Boby Despotovski's equaliser in the second kept the Glory in the top four.
