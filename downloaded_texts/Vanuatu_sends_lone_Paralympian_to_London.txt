London, England â€” When Marcel Houssimoli enters London's Olympic Stadium tonight, he will be the only competitor from Vanuatu to represent his country at the 2012 Summer Paralympics.

The 2012 Games will be only the third time that Vanuatu has sent a team, with George Kalkaua and Mary Mali Ramel representing the country at the 2000 Summer Paralympics, competing in the javelin, and Tom Tete representing the country at the 2008 Summer Paralympics in powerlifting.

The Espiritu Santo based Houssimoli will compete in the men's T37 classification running in the 100m, 200m and 400m events. Athletics at the 2012 Summer Paralympics start on Thursday.

Just getting from his home to London required a lot as he flew from Santo to the capital of Port Vila, flew to Brisbane, caught another flight to Singapore before finally getting a plane to London.
