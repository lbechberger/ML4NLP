According to Defend America, US Department of Defense News website, US
soldiers members of the 256th Brigade Combat Team, the 199th Forward Support Battalion (FSB), with several units from Camp Liberty (18th Military Police Brigade, 16th MP Brigade, 617th MP Brigade, 307th Psychological Operations Battalion, and the Iraqi Highway Patrol) provided medical assistance to Iraq children at an elementary school in Bagdah.

US Major Alan Kabakoff, with the 16th MP Brigade, says humanitarian
missions are very important in winning the war on terror, although you can't see
the importance sometimes: "It's like fire prevention, everyone knows
that it works, it's just hard to prove, unless something bad happens. These
people want the same things that we do, they want safe schools,
safe homes, and safe areas to raise their kids."

Staff Sgt. Jason Escoyne, Co. C, 199th FSB, who examined the children said
that there was nothing seriously wrong with them. 

This effort is part of the US reconstruction of Iraq.
