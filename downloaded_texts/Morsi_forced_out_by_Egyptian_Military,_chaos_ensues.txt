Today at XXX, Egyptian President was removed from office by the Egyptian Military. 

This comes after the military issued an ultimatum to Morsi two days ago, giving him until now to answer the demands of the hundreds of thousands of people protesting Morsi's presidency since his one year presidential anniversary on Sunday.

Yesterday, Morsi gave a 45 minute speech on Egyptian State Television reinstating he was a legitimate, democratically elected leader, and should not be forced out by the ultimatum. In his speech he said “The people empowered me, the people chose me, through a free and fair election. Legitimacy is the only way to protect our country and prevent bloodshed, to move to a new phase. Legitimacy is the only thing that guarantees for all of us that there will not be any fighting and conflict, that there will not be bloodshed. If the price of protecting legitimacy is my blood, I’m willing to pay it. And it would be a cheap price for the sake of protecting this country.”
