Prosecutors in the child pornography case against John Mark Karr in California, who had confessed to the murder of JonBenet Ramsey in 1996, have dropped all charges against Karr due to the lack of evidence.

"The impression that we've had all along is that the prosecution had every intention of getting this case to trial, regardless of the evidence. I am pleasantly surprised by them having done the right thing," said the lawyer who represents Karr, Robert Amparan.

Judge Rene Chouteau, the judge presiding on the case against Karr in Sonoma County has ordered the "immediate release" of Karr.

Karr was extradited from Thailand after he had confessed to the murder of Ramsey and was taken to California in September to face charges of possessing child pornography, but the computer that contained the evidence was lost. Charges against Karr, for the murder of Ramsey were dropped when DNA taken from Karr did not match DNA taken from the crime scene.

The computer was taken from Karr in 2001.
