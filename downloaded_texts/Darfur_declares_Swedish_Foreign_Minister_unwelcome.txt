According to the governor of Darfur, Swedish Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs Carin Jämtin is not welcome in the region due to Sweden's involvement in the Mohammed Cartoons controversy. Her planned visit has now been cancelled for security reasons. Jämtin's press secretary, John Zanchi, believes that the true motivation is that Darfur's governor wants as little foreign involvement as possible in the local conflict. Sweden has been actively working to send UN peacekeepers to the region.

Jämtin had earlier stated a desire to visit Darfur after receiving worrying reports of the humanitarian situation there. Her visit had been cleared by the government in Khartoum. The Foreign Minister will continue her trip to other parts of Sudan, including a visit to the Vice President.
