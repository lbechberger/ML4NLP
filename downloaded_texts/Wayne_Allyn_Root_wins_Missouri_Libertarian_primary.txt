Wayne Allyn Root, one of the leading competitors for the Libertarian Party's nomination for the 2008 U.S. presidential election, won the Missouri primary on Super Tuesday.

He came second in Arizona, ahead of Barry Hess, a native of the state. In California he was beaten by Steve Kubby, taking third place. Mr. Root did not campaign in any of these states.

The Libertarian Party will hold their national convention on May 22, ending on May 26. During this time, nearly 1,000 delegates will meet at the Adam's Mark Hotel in Denver to choose their presidential and vice presidential nominees.

Currently, Mr. Root has raised the highest amount of money out of all the Libertarian candidates, $14,330.
