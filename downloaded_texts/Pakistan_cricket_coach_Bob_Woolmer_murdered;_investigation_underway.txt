Ex-England international cricketer and Pakistan cricket coach Bob Woolmer's death is now the subject of a murder investigation by police in Kingston, Jamaica.

At a press conference last night, the Chief of Police confirmed that Woolmer's death at the age of 58 was the result of "manual strangulation". 

Commenting on his death, the Deputy police commissioner, Mark Shields, said "Bob was a large man - It would have taken some significant force to subdue him."

Jamaican police questioned members of the Pakistan cricket squad on Thursday, after which the team were fingerprinted and then allowed to leave for their hotel in Montego Bay. They are planning to return home to Pakistan on Saturday.

Police are now studying CCTV footage from the hotel where the team are staying, in the hope of finding any clues as to the identity of Mr Woolmer's killers.

The pathologist states that he had died from asphyxiation caused by manual strangulation.
