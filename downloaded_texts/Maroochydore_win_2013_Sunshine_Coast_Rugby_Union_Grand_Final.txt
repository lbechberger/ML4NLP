From its beginnings in 1982 through 2006, Maroochydore and Noosa were the only two clubs to win the Sunshine Coast A-grade rugby union premiership. University were the team to break this run — winning in 2007, 2008, and 2009. Noosa would reclaim the premiership in 2010 before University and Caboolture won the next two respectively.
