The Tech Beat, an online extension of BusinessWeek magazine, posted a profile of Wikinews on Tuesday. Wikinews is an open content news source run by the non-profit Wikimedia Foundation.

The review compares Wikinews to "a cost-free Associated Press or Reuters", noting the volunteer base of citizen journalists that collaborate in writing Wikinews articles. The Tech Beat cites the recent successes of Internet blogs as evidence that Wikinews has a bright future. 

The recent offer by Google to host Wikipedia, an open content encyclopedia, was also mentioned to attest to the potential of Wikinews.

Wikinews was launched as a demonstration wiki in November 2004.
