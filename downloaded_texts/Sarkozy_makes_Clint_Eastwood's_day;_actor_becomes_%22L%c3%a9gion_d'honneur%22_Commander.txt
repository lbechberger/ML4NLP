Yesterday, French President Nicolas Sarkozy appointed the American actor Clint Eastwood Commander of the Légion d'honneur (Legion of Honour). The country's Minister of Culture, many actors, and directors participated in events at the ceremony.

In February 2009 Eastwood was awarded a Golden Palm (Palme d'Or) in Paris for his life's work — an award usually only given at the annual Cannes Film Festival. The internationally-renowned film star was born in San Francisco and described France in an interview as his second home. In 2007, then-President Jacques Chirac appointed him a Knight of the Order.

Within the Légion d'honneur, founded on May 19, 1802 by Napoleon Bonaparte, are five classes of orders in addition to Grand Master, but the ranking distinguishes only the three degrees of Knight (Chevalier), Officer and Commander (Commendatore). With his appointment as Commander, 79-year-old Eastwood skips the level of Officer.
