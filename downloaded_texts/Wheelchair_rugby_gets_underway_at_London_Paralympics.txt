Before a full house at a game that was the first one to sell out in the lead up to the start of the London Paralympics, the United States national wheelchair rugby team defeated Great Britain national wheelchair rugby team by a score of 56–44. While the game got off to a slow start for the United States, once the team found its rhythm, they dominated the home team and appeared to score at will. Despite this, the crowd supported their side, even when they were down by eight points. When the United States bench started a chant of U-S-A! U-S-A!, the crowd soon drowned them out with a chant of Team G-B! Team G-B!

The United States came to London as defending gold medalists and ranked first in the world. Coming into the game, the team's assistant coach James Mate told the media regarding this game, "To be truthful we have played the home team a couple of times, but you have to play the game in that moment and it can give the hosts the edge. [...] In Beijing, Great Britain gave us our best game, and the semifinal was a three-goal game. We had something similar in June (at the Canada Cup). [...] They (Great Britain) play some like us and some like Canada, and are one of the teams that have a lot of good players, so we can't focus on just one player, but on the team as a whole." 

Ranked sixth in the world, Great Britain came to London as the home town favorites. Their roster included club players from across the country including David Anthony who plays for the Cardiff Pirates, Andy Barrow, Bulbul Hussain and Steve Brown who play for the Kent Crusaders, Jonathan Coggan and Mandip Sehmi who play for the Stoke Mandeville Storm, Mike Kerr who plays for the North West Bulls, Myles Pearson who plays for the West Coast Crash, and the team's only female player Kylie Grimes who plays for the London Wheelchair Rugby Club with teammate Ross Morrison. 

Before the game, first time Paralympian Great Britain wheelchair rugby player Mike Kerr told the media regarding his squad selection, "I felt I'd never been given a chance to get noticed, so I got myself some court time at big tournaments like Knock and Roll in 2010 (a USA national tournament) and Bernd Best (the biggest wheelchair rugby tournament in the world, held in Germany). I played well and I think people finally took notice." Regarding the wait to play, Kerr said, "It's hard. I hate waiting around. I'm here to do a job and the sooner I get started the better. But it's been a great experience so far. The crowd and support have been amazing. [...] I'm really confident. We took confidence from how we played against them at the Canada Cup (in June). If we play our game we can shock them." 

The United States meets Japan while Great Britain meets France later today in their second games in pool play.
