With victims of Hurricane Katrina moved to shelters and remote locations, their relatives and friends in other parts of the world have turned to the web to try and establish contact and confirm their health. Many families living in the path of Katrina have even been split up as they are rescued and now desperately need to contact each other.

Several web sites have started forums for posting information on missing people. The forums also allow individuals and families in the path of the hurricane who are safe post their information, where they are now located and how their family should contact them.

The American Red Cross is keeping records of all persons they treat and assist, but those records are not available either by phone or online. They have issued a press release titled AMERICAN RED CROSS URGENT FAMILY ALERT.  Quoting, in part:

:The Red Cross does not have information on the well being of any individuals.
:Our phone lines are being overwhelmed with calls, and we appreciate the desire to know how people fared during the storm.
:Please do not contact any Red Cross media representatives with welfare inquiries.
