Traditionally struggling on "the last day in September," Collingwood won their fifteenth premiership on "the first Saturday in October." Almost 20 years to the day after their last premiership &mdash; they won the 1990 premiership on October 6 that year &mdash; and a day over 33 years since the last drawn Grand Final, Collingwood defeated St Kilda 16-12 108 to 7-10 52.

"This is the best feeling I’ve ever had, let’s hope there’s a few more to come,” Collingwood’s Scott Pendlebury told Channel 7.

The two teams had drawn last weeks Grand Final. Under the AFL's current rules, a drawn Grand Final is replayed the next week, while games played during the proceeding three weeks go to extra time and teams get two premirership points each.

In 1990, Collingwood drew with West Coast in the Qualifying Final, which, under the rules at the time, was replayed, pushing the remain games to a week later.

St Kilda kicked one goal and eight behinds to half time. Suprisingly they only trailed by four and a half goals. They kicked six goals and two behinds in the second half but Collingwood continued to extend their lead, kicking ten goals and six behinds for the half.

The previous Grand Final replay was in 1977 when the competition was still known as the Victorian Football League. On that day Collingwood lost to North Melbourne.

Collingwood finished top of the ladder after the 22 Home and away season matches with four losses and a draw. They defeated Western Bulldogs by 62 points in the Qualifying Final then Geelong by 41 points in the Preliminary Final.

St Kilda finished third. They defeated Geelong by four points in Qualifying Final then the Western Bulldogs by 24 points in the Preliminary Final.
