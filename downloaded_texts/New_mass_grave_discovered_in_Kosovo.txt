New mass grave was discovered in a cave in Klina region, Kosovo. According to UNMIK's report, the remains are probably of non-Albanian victims, killed in Kosovo during the war in 1998. 

According to B92 there are around 46 bodies of people from villages Retimlje, Opteruša and Zočište. UNMIK's forensic team is still working on exhumation and it will take around ten days to search the whole location. Jose Pablo Baraybar, head of the Office on Missing Persons and Forensics, could not specify the number or identity of victims.

Serbian president of Coordination Center for Kosovo and Metohija, Nebojša Čović, said that Serbian authorities knew about the mass grave, but were denied access until now.
