New Delhi authorities hope a fierce looking primate will solve the problem of mischievous monkeys infilitratring the city's subway system. The Hindustan Times reports that langurs will be used to scare away their smaller cousins. A langur-wallah (or handler) is being paid 6,900 rupees (US$ 167) a month as a retainer and "will be called in whenever there is a monkey problem" says Anuj Dayal of the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation. "There are too many monkeys" said Mr. Dayal. 

In June, a monkey reportedly crawled through some pipes and into a subway car jumping around and making faces at passengers who were evacuated to another car while staff chased the creature. 

Delhi is known to suffer from trouble brought on by monkeys. The animals are reported to invade homes, schools and government offices in the city. Scores of animals have moved in as the city expands into surrounding forests. In an effort to control the problem, the Delhi administration captured about 500 monkeys and took them to the outskirts of the city last year.
