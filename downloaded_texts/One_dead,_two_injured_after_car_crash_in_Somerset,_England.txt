A man has died and another man and a woman are injured after a road traffic accident in Somerset, England, United Kingdom. At approximately 02:00 British Summer Time (01:00 UTC) yesterday, a BMW 328 that was carrying the three along the A370 road in East Brent — close to the location of Burnham-on-Sea — struck a telegraph pole before becoming stationary in a hedge and subsequently caught fire.

The 19-year-old male driver died at the location of this one-vehicle collision. The male passenger and female passenger, both of which were also teenage, were transported to Weston General Hospital. The road — which electricity cables had fallen onto — was closed down for approximately nine hours, with the fire service and police present.

It is thought that the A-road has now been re-opened. The police have commenced an investigation to attempt to establish the chain of events.
