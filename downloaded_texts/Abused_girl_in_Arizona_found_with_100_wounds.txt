The 29-year-old father of a 5-year-old Phoenix, Arizona girl is being accused of regularly beating his daughter over the past few months.

KPHO-TV reported that Ezra Hazell abused the girl because she did not do her homework.

Hazell was charged on Tuesday on five counts of child abuse.

The girl's 25-year-old stepmother, Kristie Hazell, was also charged with two accounts of child abuse.

Police report that wounds across the girl's back, buttocks, legs, arms and chest total 100.

Police said that Hazell would order the girl to go into a push-up position, before beating her with a nylon military belt or a computer cord. 

Also, police said that one time, Hazell placed a book in front of the girl's head and if she got the answer to a question from the book wrong, he would beat her.

The victim is now in the care of Child Protective Services.

A school nurse reported the incident to police.
