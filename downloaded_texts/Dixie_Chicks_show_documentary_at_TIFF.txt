The Dixie Chicks screened their new documentary, "Dixie Chicks: Shut Up and Sing", at the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF).

Directed by Cecilia Peck and Barbara Kopple, the documentary follows the group from the London gig in 2003 in which lead singer Natalie Maines said she was "ashamed" George W. Bush came from Texas, up to the release of their latest album. Even though their latest album has gone platinum, the Country Music Association has not nominated them for the CMA Awards, and many radio stations still do not play their music. But despite the controversy, the Dixie Chicks are in the media, getting good reviews.

"When Natalie made her comments particularly from the country music box, there was no community, they were out there all on their own," said Kopple. "Our hope with this film, is that people will see it and no longer will the Chicks stand alone."

"They never asked me to apologize. We never debated that," said Maines. "What I said can come off as silly or whatever and just everything that has happened since then, it's more of a disgrace, just watching the footage from Hurricane Katrina, it's unbelievable." "At this stage, I don't think that I am pissing off any new people," she commented. "Yes, thank God for Canada," said Maines, noting the band found political support from countries around the world. "It's a little surprising that the U.S. hasn't necessarily caught on yet."

The band says the experience gave them the ability to stand up for what they believe in, and strengthened their bond.
