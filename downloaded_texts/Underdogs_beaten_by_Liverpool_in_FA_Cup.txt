Havant and Waterlooville F.C. were today beaten 5 -2 by Liverpool F.C. in their FA Cup 4th round game at Anfield.

Havant, who are 122 places and 5 leagues below Liverpool, scored the first goal in 8 minutes, a header by Richard Pacquette. Liverpool's Leiva Lucas then brought the teams back to one goal each, with a 25 yard attempt going in the top right corner beating goal keeper Kevin Scriven.

Havant then replied 6 minutes later, with a attempt by Alfie Potter being deflected into the goal. However the lead was again only held for a short time, until Yossi Benayoun once again brought the teams level again. Liverpool then closed out their opposition scoring three more goals to bring the end result to 5 - 2.

6,000 Havant and Waterlooville fans travelled the 250 miles to Liverpool and remained in the stadium after the game to applaud their team, most of whom have other jobs. The team were also applauded by Liverpool fans and players, after the game.

It is thought that the game has made Havant and Waterlooville around £400,000 in sales and advertising. However the £350 million deal between Liverpool's American owners highlights the difference between the two clubs.
