The Jury in the Phil Spector murder trial have begun deliberation. Phil Spector is charged with murdering actress Lana Clarkson. Spector, 40, was charged with second-degree murder. If convicted he could receive 15 years to life in prison. 

Lana Clarkson was found dead in foyer of Spector's Los Angeles area house on February 3, 2003 from a gunshot wound to the head. Prosecutors say the gun could have gone off accidentally after Spector shoved the gun into Clarkson's mouth as she tried to leave the mansion. Spector's defense claimed Clarkson was holding the gun herself when it fired and had committed suicide.
