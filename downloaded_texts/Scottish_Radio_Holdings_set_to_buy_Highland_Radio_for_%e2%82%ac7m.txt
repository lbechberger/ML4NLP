Media group, Scottish Radio Holdings (SRH), has reached an agreement to purchase Donegal's popular Highland Radio for around â‚¬7 million (USD $8.6 million). The Broadcasting Commission of Ireland has approved the deal in principle; but both the Competition Authority and the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment still are entitled to block the deal.

Highland Radio, which broadcasts in north Donegal, Ireland, first hit the airwaves in 1990. It is based in Letterkenny. SRH is a major player in the Irish media market; already owning both Today FM and FM104. Apart from operating radio stations, SRH is also a major player in the weekly newspaper market in the UK and Ireland, owning 45 titles.
