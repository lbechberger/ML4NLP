The surviving members of satirical metal band GWAR yesterday announced a charitable arts foundation in the name of Dave Brockie. Brockie, 50, died last month.

Founding frontman and singer Brockie spent 30 years leading "Earth's only openly extra-terrestrial rock band", which actually hailed from Richmond, Virginia. Their obscene lyrics and theatrical live shows brought fame to Brockie, who went by stage name Oderus Urungus, and the fellow Virginia Commonwealth University art students that made up the band.

GWAR unveiled the foundation in a video statement yesterday. Amongst the stated aims are providing support to artists who cannot acquire funds via traditional routes and "the advancement of music, images, letters and performances in the arts". The foundation is also to preserve Brockie's body of work and promote his legacy.

"We would like to thank fans and friends for their outpouring of love", the band said. 

A public memorial for Brockie is scheduled for August 15, and the annual GWAR-B-Q is to go ahead the next day. Drawing a line between the stage persona and the man who played it, the band add "Just face it â€” Oderus would order you to be present and pay tribute to Dave Murray Brockie, his own personal slave!"

Donations can be made at the GWAR-B-Q and via GWAR's website. The rubber-costumed band remains to publicly decide if they will continue to perform and record. They say the foundation's first task will be to fund and erect a monument "to provide the world with a place to pay respects to the memory of a very cherished man".
