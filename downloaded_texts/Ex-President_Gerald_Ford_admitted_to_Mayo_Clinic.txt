Former President of the United States Gerald Ford, 93, has been admitted to the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, tonight, for "testing and evaluation" according to a statement from his office.

"No further releases or updates are anticipated prior to early next week," the statement also said. When contacted, Ford's spokesman did not say what treatment he was getting at the clinic, and referred all other questions to the clinic.

John Murphy, the Mayo Clinic's spokesman, said only "I can verify that the statement is correct and I have no other additional information."

Ford's activity has diminished since he suffered two small strokes five years ago. The 38th president spent 12 days in hospital this past January suffering from pneumonia.
