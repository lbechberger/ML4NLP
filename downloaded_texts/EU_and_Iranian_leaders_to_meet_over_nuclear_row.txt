In what are being called last-ditch talks to head off a nuclear row between the United States and Iran, the EU policy chief Javier Solana and the Iranian nuclear senior negotiator will have a two day meeting in an attempt to diffuse tensions. 

The Iranian official has not been identified in order to protect the secrecy of the talks. 

The location and date of the venue could change at any time - currently the venue is set for Vienna, Austria. The date has not been announced.
