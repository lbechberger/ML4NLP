Scientists in Iran have announced that they have found a new treatment for AIDS.
The Iranian Minister for Health and Education, Kamran Baqeri Lankarani issued a statement yesterday that the new formula would be administered for at least three months and would have lasting effects for up to two years, compared to drugs that need to be continually administered.

Iran's former Health Minister, Doctor Mohammad Farhadi, said that over the past five years researchers developed "a formula with herbal and chemical materials to help treat patients who are suffering from weak immunity system."

"The theory was to determine whether or not it is possible to boost the immunity system of the body. Some 60 projects were initiated to attain the result. At last the scientists found out a formula and then experimental works were carried out on animals at the laboratory to determine the effects of the formula," added Farhadi.

Lankarani stated that the drug has been tested on several patients and that the effects of the drug are "guaranteed" to work for at least two-years, but "we cannot say that effects of the newly-discovered medicine will remain in the body along the life time."
