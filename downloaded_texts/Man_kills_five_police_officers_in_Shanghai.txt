Five police officers were killed when a man attacked a police station in the Zhabei District in Shanghai, China. 

Authorities report that a 28-year-old man with the surname Yang attacked a security guard at 9:40 am CST (01:40 UTC), started a fire outside the building and then entered and attacked officers with a knife. In addition to the injured security guard and the five officers who died at the hospital, four additional officers were injured. A witness with the surname Yi told Xinhua News Agency that some had chest injuries, as well as bloodied faces.

Police state that the attacker is an unemployed man from Beijing who was seeking revenge after he was investigated last year for allegedly stealing bicycles. He is currently detained at the station.

Shanghai is the largest city in China, in terms of population, and is a major business, finance, and trade center. The Zhabei District near central Shanghai has a population of over 800,000 and is a hub for business and education.

Authorities are investigating how the man was able to start a fire outside the station, before causing the deaths and injuries, without being arrested quickly.
