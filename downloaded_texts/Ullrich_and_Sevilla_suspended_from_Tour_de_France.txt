T-Mobile suspended the Tour de France contestants Jan Ullrich and Oscar Sevilla, and they will not participate in the Tour de France. Ullrich's mentor, Rudy Pevenage, is also suspended.

The news was published at today's press meeting.

It is the first consequence of the big Spanish doping-scandal. The 32-year old Jan Ullrich won Tour de France in 1997. He was together with Team CSC's Ivan Basso the favorite winner in Tour de France, and the Spaniards Oscar Sevilla was one of Ullrich's most important helpers.

All three have to prove their innocence before they can be released, said the German crew who will try to get the two new bikers in the game.

Team CSC-owner Bjarne Riis said friday, when he was on his way to meet the other sports executives, and the Tour-management:

- "It is sad news. I just heard it. It is of course a shame."

Altogether 22 riders are mentioned on the list.
