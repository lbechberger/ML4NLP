The Washington Post has reported that the lone anthrax killer, Bruce Ivins, reportedly edited Wikipedia under the username Jimmyflathead. The contributions from the Jimmyflathead account reveal a few hundred edits were made from December 2005 to September 2007, and almost all of them concern inclusion of information critical of Kappa Kappa Gamma, a sorority which Ivins became obsessed with after being rebuffed by a woman in the sorority during his days as a student at the University of Cincinnati.

The anthrax letters are believed to have been mailed from a letterbox in Princeton, New Jersey, some 60 feet from a Kappa Kappa Gamma office.

Wikinews looked at the edits made by the account, and information revealed in the edits is made available below.

Wikipedia user ppfleiger described how Jimmyflathead bullied other users. Ppfleiger said that "most of the negative content on the [talk] page [of Kappa Kappa Gamma] is merely there because you [Jimmyflathead] bullied folks with threats of adding negative content and through personal emails."
