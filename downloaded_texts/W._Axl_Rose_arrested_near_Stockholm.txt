Singer W. Axl Rose, of the band Guns 'N Roses, was arrested early Tuesday morning for assaulting and biting a security guard on the leg outside the Stockholm, Sweden hotel where he was staying.

Rose, who performed in Stockholm on Monday, was held by the Swedish police on the suspicion of threatening and attacking the guard, as well as causing damage to the hotel. According to a police spokeswoman, Rose was intoxicated and threatening to the arresting police officers, necessitating the use of handcuffs. He was later jailed due to the potential flight risk he posed.

At approximately 7 p.m. CEST (1700 UTC), Rose was released, having admitted his guilt in the crimes. The likely punishment will be a fine, most likely to the sum of 40 thousand Swedish crowns, as well as an additional 10-thousand-crown restitution for the bitten security guard. The incident followed Rose's concert at the Globe Arena in Stockholm.
