The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) today rejected the creation of a .XXX top-level domain name in a 9-to-5 vote. The .XXX domain would have been created for use by websites that offered pornography. Supporters of the proposal, which would have created a new sponsored top-level domain (sTLD), say the 'triple X' domain would make it easier to recognise and filter pornographic websites. Opponents suggested that the domain wouldn't be used by all sites, as registration would be voluntary, and that it would legitimise pornography.

Current sponsored top level domains include .coop, used by cooperative associations, .museum for museums, and .travel for travel agents, airlines, and other travel-related sites. .post, for postal services, is also currently under consideration.
