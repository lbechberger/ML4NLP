The Calbuco volcano in Southern Chile erupted twice on Wednesday. It was the first major eruption of the volcano in over fifty years.

The Chilean National Geology and Mining Service said the second eruption was more powerful than the first. By reports, the first eruption caused some regional panic. Emergency officials had very little time to alert local residents because of its abruptness. 
 
The Chilean interior ministry said over 4,000 people were evacuated. The volcanic ash rose upward over six miles and has caused flight cancellations. According to Chilean health ministry sanitary planning division head Bernardo Martorell, the ash could cause water pollution and eye and skin infections. As of yesterday, Associated Press said no-one was reported injured as a result of the eruption. But on Thursday a ministry official said they fear another eruption may occur.

This was not the only volcanic eruption in the region in recent years. Another volcano in Southern Chile erupted in back in 2011. Due to that violent eruption, hundreds of flights were cancelled and over 3,000 people evacuated.

The 6,500 foot volcano is reportedly among the three most hazardous in Chile.
