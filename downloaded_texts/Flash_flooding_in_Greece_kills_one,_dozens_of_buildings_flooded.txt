A state of emergency was declared on the island of Evvoia in Greece on Saturday after flash flooding resulting from heavy rains flooded dozens of homes and businesses and killed at least one person.

The single casualty from the flooding was a 39-year-old policeman in the city of Kymi, whose car was 
overtaken by a flash flood and swept into a river.

The mayor of one of the island's town told local news that water depth had reached 1.5 metres (5 feet).

According to local officials, tens of buildings were flooded, and considerable damage was done to main roads, some of which were cut off. A bridge also collapsed due to the torrential rains.
