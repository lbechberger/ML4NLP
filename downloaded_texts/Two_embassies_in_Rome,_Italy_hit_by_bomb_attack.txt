The Chilean and Swiss embassies in Rome, Italy were the subject of separate bombings Thursday. The parcel bombs detonated at the embassies leaving two people injured.

A parcel bomb concealed in a package was detonated when the package was opened by a worker at the Swiss embassy. The worker, 53, was hospitalized with injuries to the hands and according to reports faced amputation of one or both hands. A second bomb detonated at the Chilean embassy, just hours later. An employee was also injured.

Rome's mayor Gianni Alemanno suggested in a statement that there was potential for more attacks, "It's a wave of terrorism against embassies, something much more worrisome than a single attack." The attack is being investigated as "an attack with terrorist aims" according to the Italian news agency ANSA. The Italian foreign minister Franco Frattini also issued a statement saying, "We express full solidarity with the Swiss ambassador and all diplomatic staff, targeted by a deplorable act of violence that merits the firmest condemnation."

No one has claimed responsibility for the attack.

Yesterday there were two bomb threats at two local government offices, however they were determined to be fake. On Wednesday, a fake bomb was discovered on an empty train car.
