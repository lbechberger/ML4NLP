Before the holiday started, American Christian televangelist Jerry Falwell has asked that Christians across America boycott Target Corporation department stores for their refusal to include "Merry Christmas" in advertisements or store decore, instead opting to use the more inclusive phrase, "Happy Holidays."

Target was not the only recipient of criticism, as Costco and several other stores have used similar greetings during the 2005 holiday season. Falwell and the American Family Association have threatened to boycott Target and Costco for not using the phrase "Merry Christmas" explicitly.

In a similar debate, the decorated spruce at Capitol Hill in Washington D.C. was known as a "Holiday Tree" earlier this year, but was renamed "Christmas Tree" after objections by Speaker of the House Dennis Hastert (R-IL).
