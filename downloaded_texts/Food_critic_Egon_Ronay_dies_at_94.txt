Hungarian food critic Egon Ronay, who was associated to British eateries, died on Saturday morning. He was known for publishing guidebooks, popularizing the concept of restaurant reviews.

Ronay was born in Budapest, Hungary in 1915, but he left the country due to World War II. He departed and has lived in London since October 10, 1946. Ronay was able to work in many hotels and restaurants, such as Princess Restaurant in Piccadilly.

He was also a contributor to the Daily Telegraph and editor for its food column. Ronay published the book Egon Ronay's Guide to British eateries in 1957.

Ronay had fallen sick earlier and died on Saturday, reported friend Nick Ross.
