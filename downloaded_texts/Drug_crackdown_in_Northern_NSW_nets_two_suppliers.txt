New South Wales Police, on Monday arrested and charged two people in separate simultaneous raids in Northern NSW. The raids follow an investigation into cannabis supply by Strike Force Bayan.

Police conducted three separate raids simultaneously around 7:30 p.m. on properties in Mullaway, Woolgoolga and Halfway Creek, all just North of Coffs Harbour on the NSW North Coast.

Police claim to have seized AUD $400,000 worth of cannabis at a property in Mullaway and have arrested and charged a 35 year-old man with drug possession.

The other person caught by the operation was a 46 year-old woman at the Woolgoolga property. She was charged with supplying cocaine.

Police found a large amount of cannabis and money at the Halfway Creek property but are yet to lay charges over the discovery.

Back in December 2000, a Alcohol and Other Drug Sector Agency Forum discovered that the rate of cannabis use among young people in the Coffs Harbour area was particularly high and that many cannabis users come from families where parents and even grandparents use the drug.
