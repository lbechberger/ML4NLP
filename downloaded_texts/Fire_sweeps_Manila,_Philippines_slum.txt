A large fire has swept suburban Manila, Philippines, destroying many houses and has left many homeless. At least two hundred fire engines have been sent to extinguish the flames.

The fire spread quickly due to strong winds and summer high temperatures. No fatalities were reported, although one resident suffered first degree burns; a Manila fire marshal told BBC News two people were reported missing as well. The fire started on Sunday afternoon and was still burning at nightfall, while people were trying to rescue some of their belongings.

"We failed to save anything except our clothes," said resident Glen Sardon to the Associated Press. Reports say 600 homes were destroyed and at least 7,000 residents are homeless.

Slum areas in the city are exposed constantly to fires because the houses, often made from wood, are in close proximity to one another.
