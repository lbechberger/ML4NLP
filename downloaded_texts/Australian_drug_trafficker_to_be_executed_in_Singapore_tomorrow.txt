Convicted Australian drug trafficker Van Nguyen will be executed at Singapore's Changi prison tomorrow at 6:00am SGT (8:00pm tonight UTC, 9:00am AEST). Nguyen was caught with 396.2 grams of heroin, more than 25 times the amount that mandates a death sentence.

Following an appeal to the Prime Minister of Singapore, Lee Hsien Loong by Australian Prime Minister John Howard, Nguyen was able to hold hands with his mother and brother as he said goodbye for the last time. 

Supporters will hold a vigil outside the prison before his death.

On December 2, Nguyen will be handcuffed and taken to the gallows in Singapore's Changi Prison to be hanged for drug trafficking.
