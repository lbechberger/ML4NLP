Joe Manchin, governor of West Virginia, named attorney Carte Goodwin to replace the late Robert C. Byrd, who died at age 92 on June 28, in the U.S. Senate until a special election is held. Goodwin will be sworn in next Tuesday.

The special election has not been scheduled; however, it could occur as early as November 2. Senator Jay Rockefeller, member of the Democratic Party in West Virginia, says that the appointment of the Senate's 59th Democrat is crucial to passing an unemployment benefits bill that has been blocked by members of the Republican Party.

"My responsibility [is] to work very hard every day to maintain the trust of the people of West Virginia," Goodwin said. "My sole objective will be to make West Virginia proud. I'm excited about the challenge. I'm looking forward to it," he added.

Goodwin, who is 36, will become the youngest member of the Senate. He served as an adviser to Governor Manchin from 2005 to 2009. Before this assignment was announced, Goodwin worked as an associate in his family's Charleston-based law firm.
