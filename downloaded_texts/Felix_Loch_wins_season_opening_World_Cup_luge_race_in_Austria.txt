Reigning Olympic luge champion Felix Loch has won season-opening race of the 2010 World Cup in Innsbruck Igls, Austria. Loch defeated fellow German David Moeller for a 1–2 German finish. This is Loch's second World Cup race win, the first being last season in Altenberg, Germany. Italian Armin Zoeggeler came in third.

Loch is still competing with a hip injury. “As a consequence of my injury I’m still wasting some vital fractions of a second at the start," he said. "One cannot force an overall World Cup victory but I’ve enough time to make a go at it. However, it would be nice to win some more World Cup events this season.”

The first ever team competition also took place this year. The German team of Tatjana Huefner, Andi Langenhan, Tobias Wendl, and Tobias Arlt won the event. Canada came in second, while Italy came third.
