Quebec City Mayor Andrée Boucher was pronounced dead on Friday at age 70. She was found unconscious at her home from what was reported to be heart failure, although the cause of death is expected to be confirmed by autopsy. Jacques Joli-Coeur was designated interim mayor.

Boucher became Quebec City's mayor in 2005. She previously served as mayor of the nearby community of Sainte-Foy. 

Tributes were issued by Quebec Premier Jean Charest, Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper, national opposition leader Stéphane Dion, NDP Leader Jack Layton, and politician and former Quebec City broadcaster André Arthur, a frequent critic of Boucher.
