Tommy Thompson has joined the growing number of secretaries to leave President George Bush's cabinet. 

While Thompson will stay on until his replacement is chosen, he has said he looks forward to joining the private sector.

Thompson served as governor of Wisconsin for a record 4 consecutive terms until 2001, when he joined the Bush Administration.
