Satellite radio provider Sirius Satellite Radio will soon release a portable player which mixes online radio recording with MP3 and Windows Media Audio (WMA) file format playback capabilities.

The S50 unit is bundled with the car dock being sold by Sirius. Users record radio programming from 
the car dock and transfer the files to the S50. Users can also opt to 
transfer programming via the home dock, but that device does not come 
bundled with the S50. Sirius notes that the unit can hold up to 50 
hours of satellite programming and MP3/WMA files. The latter is 
transferred to the system via PC. Users also have the option to listen 
to live radio broadcasts through the S50.
