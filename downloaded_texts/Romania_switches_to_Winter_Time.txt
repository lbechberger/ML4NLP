In the morning of 30 October 2005, Romania with other countries from Europe will switch to Official Winter Time. Thus, 04:00 AM will become 03:00 AM and will be valid until 26 March 2006 when the Official Summer Time will be again used. 



Following Romanian Government's Decision nb. 20 from 1997, Romania adopts Winter Time and Summer Time in the same day with the states of European Union and other countries part of this deal. Official Winter Time is adopted in the last Sunday of October and the Summer Time in last Sunday of March.

Usually, the official time of a country is Winter Time. Summer Time is a legal time adopted by some countries or territories during a part of a year. Summer Time is usually one hour in front of Standard Official Time.

This system is used for daylight-saving. During summer months, the time is moved forward in order to use as much sunlight for human activities, as well as to save electric energy used for lighting.

In Romania, Summer Time was first introduced in 1932. Until 1939 this worked yearly from the first Sunday of April (in 1932: 22 May) 00:00 AM and the first Sunday of October 01:00 AM (local time). From 1 April 1940 00:00 AM and 2 November 1942 03:00 AM, Summer Time was permanent in Romania. From 1943 the Summer Time was suspended and Romania used just Official Time (Winter Time).

Summer Time was reintroduced from 1979 and guided by two rules until the alignment to European Standards:
* 1979–1983: first Sunday of April 00:00 AM – last Sunday of September 01:00 (exception: 1979, Summer Time was started in 27 May);
* 1984–1996: last Sunday of March 00:00 – last Sunday of September 01:00
