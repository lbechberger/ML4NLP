Amid an escalating rape and racial discrimination scandal involving members of the Duke University Men's Lacrosse team, Monday the university announced it has cancelled the rest of the team's season. Head coach Mike Pressler has also resigned after 16 seasons with the Blue Devils, winning last year's Atlantic Coast Conference championships, and leading his 2005 squad to the national title game.

Allegations of rape surfaced last week when an African-American exotic dancer came forward, saying she was forcefully engaged into sexual intercourse by a group of caucasian lacrosse players at a house party. The investigation is continuing, with investigators awaiting DNA test results from all 46 white athletes on the team of 47. 

No charges have been filed. However, a team member has been suspended from the University for an e-mail proposing a grisly entertainment in his dorm room. DNA samples have been taken from the 46 caucasian team members.
