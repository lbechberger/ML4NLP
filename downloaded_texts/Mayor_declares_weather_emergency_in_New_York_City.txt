On Tuesday, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg announced a weather emergency in New York City, New York. The announcement was issued as a preemptive measure in preparation for an expected 6-12 inches of snow Wednesday, although the Metropolitan Transportation Authority claims to be ready for 14 inches. 

Bloomberg explained the meaning of the preemptive announcement by stating: "We recognize that we did not do the job that New Yorkers rightly expect of us in the last storm. We intend to make sure that does not happen again." Despite declaring an emergency, the mayor said the city would not make the decision to close public schools until 5 AM.

The city is looking for people to shovel snow off sidewalks and intersections. The New York City Housing Authority announced on their Twitter page, "Turn a snow day into a payday. The city is looking for snow removal help. Apply now." The linked page offered $12 an hour to shovel snow for the city.
