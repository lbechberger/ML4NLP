According to the United States Geological Survey (USGS) a powerful magnitude 7.5 earthquake struck Indonesia's main island, Java, at 5:05 p.m. UTC, which is just after midnight locally.

The epicenter was located 100 kilometers (65 miles) east of Jakarta and was at a depth of 289.2 km (179.7 miles). The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said that no tsunami is expected as the depth of the quake exceeded 280 km.

There are no reports of damage, injuries or deaths.

"No reports of damage or casualties have been received at this time. Because this earthquake is located about 290 km below the surface of the earth, it will have been felt strongly over a wide area, but is not likely to cause severe damage. We have received reports that the earthquake was felt in much of Java and in parts of Malaysia", said a statement posted on the USGS website.
