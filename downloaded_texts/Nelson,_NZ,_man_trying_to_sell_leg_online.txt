Original Story
--
Nelson man Shane Torrance is trying to sell his leg that got amputated because of diabeties for $3000 (NZD) to help his daughter, who also has diabetes.

He posted it on TradeMe (http://www.trademe.co.nz) but it was removed within a couple of hours of it first appearing online.
It is against TradeMe's terms and conditions to buy and sell body parts on their website.

Shane Torrance could also be charged for trying to sell his amputated leg under the Crimes Act or the Human Tissues Act.

He said he kept it because "I'd had it for 42 years".
