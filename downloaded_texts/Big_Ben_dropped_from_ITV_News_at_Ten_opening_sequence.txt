ITV have dropped images of the face of Big Ben from the title sequence of ITVâ€™s News at Ten. ITN announced that the images were being removed as the show begins a revamp. The change comes as the company wants to engage with viewers who live outside of London where Big Ben is situated. The changes will be made on November 2 of this year. 

The bongs that come from the clock's bell will however remain as part of a new soundtrack.
 
The ITV news returned in 2001 at the new time of 10:30 pm but was later changed back to its original timeslot of 10:00 pm in 2008. The original ITV News at 10 was dropped in 1999 after 32 years on air. 

Current anchors Mark Austin and Julie Etchingham will remain as the show's presenters after the revamp.
