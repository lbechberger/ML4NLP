Four US soldiers were killed by an explosion on Saturday morning in Afghanistan when their vehicle ran over a mine. The soldiers, part of a joint U.S.-Afghan patrol, were travelling forty miles south of Kabul when the explosion occurred.

A Marine also died in a separate incident while performing a security patrol in Anbar province.

Seven U.S. soldiers have been killed this year in Afghanistan.

Two U.S. soldiers were also killed in Baghdad and two wounded when their patrol was attacked with a car bomb.
