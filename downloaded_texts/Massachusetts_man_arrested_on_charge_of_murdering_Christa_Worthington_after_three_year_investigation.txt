Christopher McCowen, a 33-year-old garbage collector, has been arrested and charged with first degree murder, aggravated rape, and armed assault. Christa Worthington, a United States fashion writer, was found stabbed to death three years ago on January 6, 2002, in her home in Truro, Massachusetts. Her 2-year old daughter, found with her, was unharmed.

The Truro police had already attempted a mass DNA test of all male residents of the town, on the third anniversary of the murder three months before, prompting an outcry from the ACLU. McCowen himself had in fact already provided a DNA sample to the police prior to the mass testing, in March 2004.
