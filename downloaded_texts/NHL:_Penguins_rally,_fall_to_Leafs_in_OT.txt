Kyle Wellwood and Darcy Tucker assisted Kilger on the goal. Gary Roberts, the product of one of Pittsburgh's deadline trades anwsered just over two minutes later to tie the match. Sergei Gonchar, one of the NHL's highest scoring defenders picked up an assist along with Rookie of the Year contender Evgeni Malkin. Toronto would strike back at 18:30, when Alexei Ponikarovsky scored his 20th goal of the season, assisted by Nik Antropov and Mats Sundin. The Maple Leafs kept piling on goals, with Tomas Kaberle and Bryan McCabe each scoring to make it 4-1.

Trailing by one goal, Ryan Whitney stepped up for the Penguins, firing a pass from Sergei Gonchar beyond Leafs goalie Andrew Raycroft with four seconds remaining in regulation. The stunned fans inside the AirCanada Center got their money's worth, however, as Toronto's Tomas Kaberle, the eventual 1st star of the game would score in overtime to give the Maple Leafs the win and the critical extra point.
