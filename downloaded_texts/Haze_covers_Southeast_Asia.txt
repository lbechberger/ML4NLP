The haze situation in Southeast Asia has still not subsided, despite efforts by the Indonesian government to douse the flames. In Singapore, the Pollutant Standards Index hit 103, in the unhealthy range, at 8AM (GMT+8); Malaysia's capital, Kuala Lumpur, is also covered in smoke, with the Air Pollution Index (or Air Quality Index) in the Klang Valley region registering at 103.

The latest pictures from satellites NOAA 12 and NOAA 18 show a combined total of 107 hotspots in Borneo and 89 in Sumatra
