Militants attacked three Indian Army vehicles this morning in the Rajouri district of Jammu and Kashmir. A passenger bus was fired in this attack and a woman was killed and nine others were injured.

R. K. Jalla, Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP), Rajouri, said that militants marched to the hilltops and attacked three Army trucks in which the Commanding officer (CO) of the Rashtriya Rifles was travelling. Soldiers of the Indian Army rushed to the spot when the report of the attack arrived.

The soldiers fired at the militants to defend the vehicle. The militants, who hid in the nearby maize field, mistook the passengers to be the soldiers and fired at them. One woman, identified as Kiran Balla from Poonch, was killed and nine others, of whom two were soldiers, were injured in this gunfire.

Reinforcements have been sent by the Army to the place where the firing is still going on. The bus has been evacuated and the injured have been taken to a local hospital in Rajouri. A senior officer in Nagrota said, "The maize, standing at more than six feet tall, is hampering search operations."
