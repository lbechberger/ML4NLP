Foreign affairs minister Peter MacKay was accused last week of calling Liberal MP Belinda Stronach a "dog" in the House of Commons.

Stronach, a feminist, said the comment was offensive to all women.

NDP leader Jack Layton said on Saturday that MacKay should apologise or resign.

MacKay said that he did not call her a dog. "I made no such gesture. I made no derogatory or discriminatory remark toward any member of the House," MacKay said yesterday in the House of Commons.

Despite MacKay's comment, the Liberals are still asking for an apology.
