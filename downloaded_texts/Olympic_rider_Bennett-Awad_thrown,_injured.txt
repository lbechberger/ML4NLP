Olympic rider Hawley Bennett-Awad is in hospital after being thrown from her horse during an Olympic equestrian competition today. Bennett-Awad, 35, is in a stable condition in the Royal London Hospital.

The Canadian rider fell reportedly at the third fence, a fence with musical notes which may distract horses. Bennett-Awad's horse, Gin and Juice, is said to have previously bucked its rider resulting in several hospital trips. 

Hawley was not the only one who fell today. Reportedly about six riders fell on the course, which is 5.7 kilometres with sharp turns and several drops.

After the fall, she was eliminated from the event.
