Vincent Schiavelli could do with a glance what many actors work a lifetime to perfect. Schiavelli had the countenance of one of Dali's melting clocks, the hooded eyes of a mobster and the smile of someone who might be light years off his meds.

It was a look that launched his career. By the time Schiavelli died at age 57, he had starred in 150 television shows and movies. He had a name people couldn't remember and a face people couldn't forget.
