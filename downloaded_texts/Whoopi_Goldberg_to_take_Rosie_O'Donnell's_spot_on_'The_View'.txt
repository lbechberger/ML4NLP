Actress, Oscar, Emmy, Grammy and Tony Award winner, Whoopi Goldberg will be taking Rosie O'Donnell's place as co-host of The View.

It was confirmed by the shows host Barbara Walters on Wednesday's show who said that Goldberg will begin to co-host on September 4, the shows season premiere. Shortly after the announcement, Goldberg made an appearance on the show.

"I love this show! I love coming on it. I love hanging out with you guys," said Goldberg who also said that she does not plan to have a feud with any of the other co-hosts.

"Who knows? Anybody could say 'I don't like her.' That's OK. I just won't come to your home," added Goldberg.

When O'Donnell co-hosted The View, she sparked a feud with Donald Trump after O'Donnell called Trump a "pimp" in her personal blog by saying that Trump "has no right to be the moral compass for 20-year-olds in America."

Goldberg has starred in such films as The Color Purple (1985), Ghost (1990) and Sister Act One and Two (1992 &amp; 1993)
