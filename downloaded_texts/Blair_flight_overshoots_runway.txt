A British airways flight from London, England to Miami, Florida containing British prime minister Tony Blair has missed a taxiway at Miami airport. The Boeing 747-400 plane hit lights as it was turning off the runway onto a taxiway taxiing at 1815 local time on Tuesday evening (2315 GMT).

The pilot couldn't see the correct taxiway due to poor lighting, said British Airways spokesman John Lampl.

Prime minister Tony Blair, with his family, was on his way to stay with Bee Gees star Robin Gibb at his house in Miami Beach when the incident occurred. The plane and all 343 passengers onboard were not damaged or hurt.

A U.S. safety board has said that it's now investigating the incident.
