After passing Ronald Reagan on Sunday, Gerald Ford became the oldest living United States President in history at 93 years old.

Ford was born on July 14, 1913 in Omaha, Nebraska and has been alive for 93 years and 121 days. Former record-holder Reagan died at 93 years and 120 days in June, 2004. Before Reagan held the record, John Adams' 90 year lifespan gave him the bragging rights. George Washington, the first former president to die, held the record before that.

A former Michigan congressman, Ford became Vice President in December of 1973 under Richard Nixon after Spiro Agnew resigned due to taking bribes.

After Richard Nixon resigned on August 9, 1974 (possibly to avoid impeachment) because of the Watergate scandal, Ford became the 38th President.

Ford was the only president who was never elected to either the presidency or the vice presidency, and remained in office until defeated by Jimmy Carter in the November 1976 Presidential election.

Ford and his wife Betty, 88, live in Rancho Mirage in the desert area of Southern California.

"The length of one's days matters less than the love of one's family and friends," said Ford in a statement in the local Desert Sun newspaper.

Ford has battled a series of illnesses this year. He has been hospitalized four times for angioplasty, shortness of breath and pneumonia, and other tests.
