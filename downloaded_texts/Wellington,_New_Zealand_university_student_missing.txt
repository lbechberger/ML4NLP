Police are concerned over the disappearance of a 19-year-old student. Daniel Antonious Hansman has not been seen since 11.30 p.m. last Thursday. He was last seen outside Coyote Bar on Courtney Place after he and his friend were refused entry because they were intoxicated. After several other unsuccessful attempts to get into other bars, his friend left for the toilet, but when he returned, Hansman was missing.

Hansman is from New Plymouth and is a student at Victoria University of Wellington. He has not attended his lectures, contacted his friends or family or gone to his flat since his disappearance.

Shane Cotter, Wellington Detective Senior Sergeant, said: "It's out of character for Daniel to disappear without any explanation. Mr Hansman had been out with two female friends and a male friend in the Courtenay Place area on Thursday night. The women were allowed into a bar."

Hansman was probably carrying his cellphone with him, but it is not being answered. He may also have his driver's licence, but police are not sure if he had any other property or ID.

Hansman is a 177-centimetre European of medium build. He has blue eyes, brown-black medium length hair, a goatee and is unshaven. He was last seen wearing dark jeans, a dark blue-black shirt with white and grey stripes and black dress shoes.
