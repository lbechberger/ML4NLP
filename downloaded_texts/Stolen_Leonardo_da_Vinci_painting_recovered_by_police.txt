Police in Britain have recovered a stolen Leonardo da Vinci painting worth, according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), £65 million (US$133 million).

"Through careful investigations and intelligence-led police work we were able to locate the painting and make four arrests. We are extremely pleased to recover the ’Madonna of the Yarnwinder’ painting," said Mickey Dalgleish, the chief Inspector for Scotland Yard.
 
The famous painting, Madonna of the Yarnwinder, painted by da Vinci in 1501, had been stolen from Drumlanrig Castle in Scotland, in August 2003, by two thieves who aimed to sell the painting in the future.

Police raided a house in Glasgow, Scotland and seized the painting, making four arrests. The FBI listed the theft of the painting as of one of the world's top ten art crimes in recent years.
