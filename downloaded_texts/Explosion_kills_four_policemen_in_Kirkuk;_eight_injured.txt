Four policemen are dead and eight people are injured, after a roadside explosion in Kirkuk, Iraq earlier today, according to Lieutenant Colonel Yadkar Muhammad.

The officers had just attended a funeral for a fellow officer, who had been killed on Friday by gunmen after another roadside explosion.

The US military had no information about today's explosion.

Hundreds of policemen have been killed since the start of the US-led war in Iraq.
