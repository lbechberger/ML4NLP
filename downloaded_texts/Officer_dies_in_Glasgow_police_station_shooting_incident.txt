A police officer has died after an incident involving a gun at a police station in Glasgow. It is thought no-one else was involved in the incident at Baird Street police station in Sighthill where an ambulance was called at 1100 UTC yesterday morning. It is thought a firearms unit is based at the station.


Strathclyde police said that an investigation was taking place into the cause of the officer's death and that a report will be sent to the procurator fiscal. They said: "As in accordance with ACPOS guidelines, officers from an independent force (Lothian and Borders Police) have been appointed to oversee the investigation. No further information will be provided until family members have been informed."

Assistant Chief Constable Bernard Higgins stated: "It is with great sadness that I have to tell you that a serving Strathclyde Police officer died today, Monday, 5 November, in an incident where a firearm was discharged at Baird Street police office. No details of the officer involved will be released until family members have been informed. ... Our thoughts are with the officerâ€™s family and friends at this difficult time."

Scottish Police Federation chairman Brian Docherty said: "We can confirm that one of our colleagues has died following a firearms incident in Baird Street police station this morning. It is too early to speculate as to the circumstances surrounding the tragic death and our thoughts turn immediately to his family who have lost their loved one and colleagues who have lost a friend."

Earlier this year, two British police officers were shot dead after responding to a reported burglary. Police constables Fiona Bone and Nicola Hughes were killed in the Hattersley area near Manchester.
