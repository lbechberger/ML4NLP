The Mozambique presidential elections vote count continued Friday in all of the country, with Frelimo and it's candidate Armando Guebuza leading, according to the preliminary results already known, and especially in Maputo, Gaza and Inhambane, traditional regions of influence for the party in power.

With just over 400 thousand votes counted, the Frelimo candidate was ahead with 293 800 votes, against 108 807 to Afonso Dhlakama and 7899 to Raul Domingos. Unnoficial estimates report abstention levels to be between 70% and 80%.

If confirmed, these abstention levels could force a run-off next month, if neither candidate wins the 50% of votes necessary to win the elections.

Mozambique's official electoral commission is only obligated to announce the final results by Dec. 17.
