Napolitano also visited the Parliament of Ghana, where he paid a courtesy call on the Speaker, Ebenezer Sekyi-Hughes. Napolitano said the European Union had a role to play in the integration of Africa. Sekyi-Hughes was pleased that the Italian president had shown confidence in Ghana's parliament and its young democracy.

Ghana and Italy affirmed their commitment to the training of civilian personnel attached to various peacekeeping missions. While there, he said "Italy appreciates the level of troop contribution to and for works done by Ghana's contingents to peacekeeping operations worldwide". He continued, "We are pleased with your sense of mission and the high level of professionalism being exhibited by your troops on peace missions, and we would continue to support you in your role".
