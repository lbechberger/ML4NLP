Randall Munroe is the writer of the popular webcomic xkcd. The comic is known for its geeky humor and minimalist drawing style that generally uses stick figures. Munroe worked as a contractor for NASA before writing xkcd full time in 2006. 

Wikinews reporter Joshua Zelinsky interviewed Munroe at Vericon, Harvard's annual science fiction convention.
