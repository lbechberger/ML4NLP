An investigation is currently under way in Argyll, Scotland, following a derailment on the Glasgow â€“ Oban railway. The incident took place at 2100 BST (2000 UTC) on Sunday, close to the 'Falls of Curchan' station. According to reports, both carriages of the derailed unit had also caught fire. At the location of the incident, the railway line is on an embankment above a local roadway, and the lead car came to rest overhanging this road.

All passengers have been successfully evacuated, with eight being taken to hospital with "serious but not life-threatening" injuries. There were no fatalities. A spokesperson for the ambulance service stated soon after the incident: "There's quite a lot of walking wounded. There's a couple of bumps to necks and backs and things like that."

The British Transport Police gave a short statement:


Inspector David McEwan being quoted as confirming that the lead coach was "sitting in a precarious position overhanging the roadway", and continued "the coach could slip further down the embankment on to the roadway [...] This is obviously a major concern for the engineers at this moment in time."

Railway engineers are currently working to stabilise the site, and re-open the line. According to a Scotrail spokesperson 
"an investigation is already under way into the cause of the incident by appropriate agencies and industry partners".
The line between Glasgow and Oban remains closed, with buses to Crianlarich and Oban replacing trains.
