The U.S. Department of State says that the Venezuelan government's measure to restrict flights to the United States violates the agreement of 1953.

In a press release the Venezuelan Institute for Aviation (Inac) announced the decision to "reduce" starting on March 1st all operations of American airlines in Venezuela.

Later, the official Institution ordered Delta and Continental Airlines the suspension of all of its activities in Venezuelan territory. It also ordered American Airlines to reduce the frequency of its flights to and from the United States.

Venezuela argues that the American Aviation Services does not respect the terms of the agreement between both countries that allows the operations of US-based companies and vice versa.
