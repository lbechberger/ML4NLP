Noosa have claimed the first spot in the 2014 Sunshine Coast Rugby Union grand final after defeating University 13–0 at Sunshine Beach, Australia on Saturday.

David Harrold opened the scoring with a penalty goal at fourteen minutes before converting a Kyle Beakey .

"We played good finals football today and University are a good side and if you give them too much ball in your territory you're going to pay for it," said Noosa coach Mick Phelan.
"It was probably our best kicking game this year and that was the difference in the end." 

Harrold kicked one more penalty goal six minutes into the second half. This took the score to 13–0, where it stayed for the rest of the game.

University now face Toads in the preliminary final at the University of the Sunshine Coast.
