The murderer, a 17-18 year old man is being sought by the police. The killer entered the church at 3:45 pm and shot the Italian priest from behind. Andrea Santore was praying at the time.

Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan condemned the assassination of a Catholic priest. Many people in Turkey associate this incident with the current crisis over the publication of cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed in European papers.
