Bayern Munich are returning to the UEFA Cup for the 1st time since winning their 2nd leg match against Valencia in the 1996/97 season.

The reason for Bayern Munich being in this tournament instead of UEFA Champions League is because of their 4th place finish in the Bundesliga last season. A standard which had not been this low since 1994/05 Bundesliga season.

Bayern Munich face Belenenses tomorrow at Allianz Arena in Munich, Germany in a Bayern Munich coach Ottmar Hitzfeld has declared his team "favourites." Hitzfeld also declared that "we mustn't take anything for granted. We can't expect to win UEFA Cup ties if we only give it 80 percent."

Bayern Munich Striker Luca Toni and Defender Marcell Jansen are expected to make their debuts tomorrow. Jansen was quoted as saying "It’s a whole new experience for me, and I’m really looking forward to it." Toni was quoted as saying "Obviously, it’s a shame we’re not in the Champions League, but we’ve always known that" and "I can hardly wait for the adventure in the UEFA Cup to begin. And it’s a significant adventure."
