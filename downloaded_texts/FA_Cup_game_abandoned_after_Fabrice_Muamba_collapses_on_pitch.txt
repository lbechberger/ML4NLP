The FA Cup quarter final tie between Tottenham Hotspur and Bolton Wanderers was abandoned after Bolton player Fabrice Muamba collapsed on the pitch. Muamba collapsed around the 41 minute mark with no players around him and was reported to have stopped breathing. The game was being played at Tottenham's home ground, White Hart Lane.

After being treated on the pitch for ten minutes by a total of six medics Muamba was taken down the tunnel while supporters of both teams chanted his name. Both mouth-to-mouth resuscitation and a defibrillator were used to try and revive the player. It was reported by ESPN that Muamba was not breathing while he was being carried down the tunnel.

Tributes have already begun to flood in offering support and prayers for the 23-year old. Former team mate Jack Wilshire tweeted "Hope Muamba is okay. Thoughts with him." Justin Hoyte, who came through the Arsenal youth team with him, said "I seriously hope my best friend in football is OK. Stay strong bro please please stay strong. God is with you remember that."

Muamba was born in Zaire, now the Democratic Republic of Congo, and came to the United Kingdom as a child. He joined Bolton Wanderers in 2008 after time with Birmingham City and the Arsenal youth squad.
