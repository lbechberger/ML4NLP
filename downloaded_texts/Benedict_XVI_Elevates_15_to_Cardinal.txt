Pope Benedict XVI elevated 15 men to College of Cardinals today at an Ordinary Consistory, a ceremony in which the new Princes of the Roman Catholic Church receive three-cornered hats of crimson, the color distinguishing their new office and signifying their willigness to shed blood to spread the Christian faith.
