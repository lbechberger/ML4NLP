An Islamic cleric named Ezzat Atiya issued a fatwa to get around gender segregation and hijab in Islam. He stated that symbolic breastfeeding could be used to make it permissible for male and female colleagues to work together alone.

Dr. Atiyah had stated that the breastfeeding does not have to be by the woman herself. "[This can also be achieved] by means of the man's mother or sister suckling the woman, or by means of the woman's mother or sister suckling the man" he wrote.

Atiya works at the Al-Azhar University, an Islamic seminary in Egypt. The seminary was established by a Shia caliphate and is named after Fatima Al-Zahra. Zahra was the wife of Ali. Al-Azhar University has a fatwa that officially sanctioned martyrdom operation with one condition only: martyrdom operations are only allowed in Israel. The university has had this ruling for a long time and has stood by it. 

Atiyah had said, 

 According to Ayatollah Mesbah Yazdi, "If someone tells you he has a new interpretation of Islam, sock him in the mouth."
