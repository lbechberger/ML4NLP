Police in London, England, UK have charged a 19-year-old man with two counts of attempted murder. Anthony McCalla, from the district of Streatham, is accused of shooting Thusha Kamaleswaran, a five-year-old girl, and Roshan Selvakumar, 35, in a shop in Stockwell, a southern district of the city.

Kamaleswaran was shot in the chest, while Selvakumar was wounded in the head. Selvakumar is currently in stable condition. Kamaleswaran's condition is listed as serious but stable.

Both victims are Sri Lankan but are unrelated to each other. The incident took place after three youngsters on bicycles pursued two youths who sought cover inside the store. According to BBC News Online, investigators have discovered that Kamaleswaran's mother, 12-year-old brother, and three-year-old sister were also inside the store during the shooting. 

McCalla is expected to appear before Camberwell Green Magistrates' Court today. A second suspect in the shooting, a 14-year-old boy, remains under arrest on suspicion of attempted murder.

For details which lead to those involved being caught, Crimestoppers is pledging a Â£50,000 reward.

Sky News reported that Kamaleswaran is believed to be the youngest victim of a gun-related offence in London.
