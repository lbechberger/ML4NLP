The majority Shia group in Iraq has nominated Ibrahim Jaafari for Prime Minister. He was chosen in a tight vote with Vice-President Adel Abdel Mahdi.

United Iraqi Alliance, who backed both men, chose a nominee today after talks amongst party leaders concerning the nomination, which had originally stalled on Saturday. 

There is little doubt that Mr Jaafari will lead the new government considering that the UIA is the largest of the Iraqi political parties. However, many say that he will be faced with the challenge of getting the support of the nation's Sunni and Kurd populations.
