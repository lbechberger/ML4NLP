Caboolture have defeated Caloundra 34–22 to secure a place in the 2013 Sunshine Coast Rugby Union A-grade Preliminary Final at Kevin Kaeser Oval, Morayfield, Australia. They are set to play Maroochydore at Sunshine Beach this coming Saturday for a spot in the August 31 Grand Final.



Trailing 22–3 at half time, Caloundra rallied to within five points. However, a try to Caboolture winger Jay Forrester with eight minutes to play eliminated them from premiership contention.

"Everyone's keen," says Forrester, "[Caboolture] want it to be back-to-back [premierships]."

Preliminary Final day is to see Caboolture play Maleny in the Under 19s (Colts), Maleny play Maroochydore in Reserve grade, and Maroochydore play Caboolture in A-grade.
