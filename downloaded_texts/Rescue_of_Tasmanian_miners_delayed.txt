Rescuers working to free miners trapped during the Beaconsfield mine collapse have moved to a slightly faster blasting method. The rescue effort was expected to conclude on Sunday, however due to rescuers encountering extremely hard rock, it has been once again delayed.

The vertical distance had previously been estimated at 1.5 metres, although rescuers believe it could be less with work being carried out overnight.

Todd Russell, 34, and Brant Webb, 37, have been underground for 13 nights after a minor earthquake triggered a rockfall in the Beaconsfield Gold Mine. They survived because they were in a small cage when the collapse occurred. Their workmate Larry Knight, 44, died in the collapse, and his funeral is to be held in Launceston on Tuesday. His family members have delayed the funeral proceedings with the hope that the trapped miners will be freed and able to attend.
