World leaders and protesters are heading to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in the eastern United States for the G20 summit set to begin this Thursday in Pittsburgh. Politicians at the summit will be discussing ways to help solve the global financial crisis while protesters will advocate everything from universal health care to an end to capitalism.

Activists met in Pittsburgh on Saturday to discuss the issues they wanted to push. Speakers included state senator Jim Ferlo of Pittsburgh who rebuked what he called the myth of the free market.

"I want to unite people in peaceful speech and peaceful discussion," Ferlo said. "I encourage each one of you to take to the streets this week." 

An extra 4,000 police have been transported to Pittsburgh ahead of the summit, and between 100 and 200 nonviolent prisoners were released from the local jail to make room for protesters.

Meanwhile the G20 leaders are sparring over whether or not to cap banker bonuses in financial industries. G20 ministers also plan to discuss rising protectionism.

At the Group of 8 meeting earlier this year in London the group decided to pledge $750 billion to the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The IMF is seeking for more money from the G20 and is responsible for loaning money to countries in exchange for the implementation of free market policies. G20 countries are responsible for 80% of the world's trade.
