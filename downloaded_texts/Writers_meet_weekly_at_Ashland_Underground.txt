Every Wednesday at 6 p.m., writers of any genre meet at an informal writers' workshop at the Ashland Underground, located at 220 W. Main in Ashland, Wisconsin, U.S.A. 

A project of the Chequamegon Bay Word Affiliate, area writers have met each week for almost three years. The group of published and aspiring writers first began meeting at the Black Cat, a local cafe, but recently moved to the Underground, where a member book cooperative has been set-up for affiliate and community readers. 

The Chequamegon Bay Word Affiliate also holds its annual Earth Day Reading each year at the nearby Northern Great Lakes Visitor Center. 

Writers of any and all skill levels can meet at the free workshop, and are encouraged to bring their latest works.
