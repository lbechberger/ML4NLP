Serie A champions Juventus have confirmed the $24,000,000 (£13,700,000, €20,000,000) capture of Arsenal captain Patrick Vieira.

The central midfielder, who will now partner Brazilian - Emerson, has signed a 5 year contract at the Stadio Delle Alpi.

Juve had been in talks for the 29-year-old for the last few weeks and a deal has been completed.

Vieira will now link up with boss Fabio Capello again after a brief stint at AC Milan with him almost a decade ago.

The Frenchman joins the side despite being strongly linked with a move to Real Madrid over the last two summers.

Vieira ends his Premiership stay after nine years in England since he became Arsene Wenger's first signing at Arsenal.
