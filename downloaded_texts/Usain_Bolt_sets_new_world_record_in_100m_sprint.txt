The Jamaican Usain Bolt set a new world record in the final of the 100m sprint, which is often considered a very important event in the Olympic games, with his time of 9.69 seconds.

BBC Sport reported that Bolt set the new world record even though "he didn't even try all of the way."

Bolt passed through the semi-final with a time of 9.85, only 0.13 seconds behind his own world record time of 9.72. This is despite the fact that, according to the BBC, Bolt jogged the last twenty metres.

The American Tyson Gay failed to qualify for the 100 metre final. "I don't have any excuses. I'm pretty upset," said Gay after realizing he had failed to finish in the top four of the semi-finals, which took place approximately two hours before the final.

The world record for the 100 metres has dropped significantly since the record of 10.6 seconds was set by Donald Lippincott on July 6, 1912.

The ten second barrier was first crossed by Jim Hines of the United States on June 20, 1968.
