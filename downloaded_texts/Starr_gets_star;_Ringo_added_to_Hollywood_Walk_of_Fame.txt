Ringo Starr, who is a member of The Beatles, was given his own star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on Monday. 


The event, which was also celebrating fifty years since the pavement was founded, took place during the night for the first time. Starr was the 2401st individual to have a star awarded on the walk. The event also took place outside of the Capitol Records Building. 


Starr said outside of the event: "This is the start of the next 50 years of stars. I'm proud to be the first one." 

According to Reuters, fellow Beatles bandmate Sir Paul McCartney was unable to attend the ceremony due to the fact that he was in England at the time, Starr said. Less than twelve months before Ringo was given his star on the Walk of Fame, Paul McCartney assisted in revealing a star for another former Beatles member, the late George Harrison. 

The late John Lennon was also given a star on the pavement, which means that Paul McCartney is now the only member of the Beatles who has not yet been awarded a star. McCartney "[w]as selected and approved [for a star] many years ago. We are just waiting for his people to give us a date on when he would like to do it," according to a Hollywood Chamber of Commerce source.

The event was also partly to promote "Y Not", the drummer's recently released album. During the ceremony for Ringo Starr's induction onto the walk, he commented: "It's cool to get [a star] at night. I don't know about you, but where I live, the stars come out at night." He referred to the other members of the Beatles as his "brothers". He also said about them: "They looked out for me, and I looked out for them. We all supported each other."
