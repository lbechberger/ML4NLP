Richard Roberts, the President of Oral Roberts University, and his wife, Lindsay Roberts, are accused of illegal political contributions, financial wrong-doing, and wrongful firings in a lawsuit filed Tuesday. 

The lawsuit was filed by three former professors who claim "they were wrongfully dismissed after reporting the school's involvement in a local political race." According to KTEN television news, "Roberts' statement says personal expenses are charged to him and he personally pays them on a monthly basis." On October 3, Roberts "told students and faculty during his weekly chapel Wednesday that the lawsuit is about intimidation, blackmail and extortion." 

Richard has been president of ORU since his father, Oral Roberts university founder and former faith healer, "semi-retired" in 1993.
