A ban against kite-flying during a traditional festival to welcome the onset of spring in the Punjab region of Pakistan has led to significant numbers of arrests. Conservative figures put the number arrested following the imposition of Thursday's ban at around 500, higher figures of 1,400 are given in Australian reports which describe events following the ban as a crackdown.

At issue is the use of glass coated or metal kite strings, and this leading towards serious injury or even death. In the 2004 celebration of the Basant festival up to nine people were killed including from electrocution when using metal strings.
