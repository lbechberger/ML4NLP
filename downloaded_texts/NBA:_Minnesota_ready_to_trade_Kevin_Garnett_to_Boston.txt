Citing "league sources," both CNN/SI and the Boston Globe are reporting that Kevin Garnett is going to the Boston Celtics in a trade involving at least six players. This transaction in the United States' premier professional basketball league NBA, which is contingent on a contract negotiation, would be considered major.

The forward, known as "Big Ticket", who has spent his entire twelve season career playing for the Minnesota Timberwolves, will join fellow all-stars Paul Pierce and Ray Allen to give Boston a boost in the Eastern Conference.

Although the deal is yet to be announced formally by either team, many news agencies are reporting that the deal has been finalized. Kevin Garnett will go to Boston, in exchange for Celtic players Al Jefferson, Sebastian Telfair, Gerald Green, Ryan Gomes, and Theo Ratliff, along with two future NBA draft picks.
