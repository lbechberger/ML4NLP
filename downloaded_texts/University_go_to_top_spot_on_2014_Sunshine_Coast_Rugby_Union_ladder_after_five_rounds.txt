University have beaten Noosa today 15 points to 13 to take top spot on Australia's Sunshine Coast Rugby Union ladder a third of the way through the season.

"This wasn't a goal for us but we'll take that," said University coach Steve Scotland to news media.

Noosa went ahead at ten minutes with a penalty goal. They conceded a try and the lead six minutes later. Uni would relinquish the lead for the remainder of the half.

The second half had seven minutes of added time due to injuries. Noosa opened the half's scoring at twenty minutes, going ahead 13–12 with an unconverted try. University scored a penalty goal nine minutes later. 15–13 Uni.

A late Noosa surge was successfully repelled in the final twenty minutes with the referee signalling full time at six minutes to five local time (0654 UTC).
