Fans of Italian football clubs Roma and Lazio are asking for ticket reimbursement, after the city rivals played 0:0 Sunday. After a good chance of Roma scoring in the opening minutes of the match, the entire game was played in the middle of the field and neither team seemed eager to score. 

Accusations were taken further as the Italian Consumer Union, Codacons, called for fans to ask for their money back, since the game result was allegedly fixed. Both teams are close to the bottom of Seria A table, and a point each will almost secure that they do not drop out of the first league. 

Italian media seems unified in opinion that this was the worst city derby ever played. Some of the headlines were "Derby of shame" and "Never again like this."

Consob, an institution monitoring the work of the regional Stock Market, announced they will take action against both teams as they have shares on market.
