A car bomb detonated Wednesday outside of Zahedan, the capital of Iran's Sistan-Baluchestan Province. The bomb killed 11 Revolutionary Guard members and injured 34 others.

Jundallah, a Sunni millitant group suspected of having ties with al-Qaida, took responsibility for the attack. Officials have yet to confirm their claim. Zahedan deputy Hossein Ali Shahriyari blamed Pakistan, calling it a "safe haven for insurgents".
