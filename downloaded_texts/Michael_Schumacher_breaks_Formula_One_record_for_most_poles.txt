Bologna, Italia - Michael Schumacher has set the Formula One pole record. "Schumi" won the pole position at the San Marino Grand Prix. The pole position was the 66th for Schumacher. Ayrton Senna held the previous record. Senna won his F1-career 65 pole positions between years 1984-1994. Schumacher has been racing in the F1-series since 1991. Senna won 40% of his pole attempts (161 races) compared to Schumacher's 28% (235 races so far). This new pole record reawakened the affection for Senna who died in 1994 on the fifth lap at the same race, the San Marino Grand Prix, a race won by Schumacher who was also champion the same year.
