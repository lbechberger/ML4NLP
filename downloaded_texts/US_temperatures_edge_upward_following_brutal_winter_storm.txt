The hulking blizzard that swept through much of the northeastern and midwestern United States just days ago is showing signs of relenting.

That system had dipped as far south as Tennessee, making parts of that state colder than parts of New York. Experts contend that a notable high-pressure front is now pushing from the Southwestern US and will likely nudge the severe cold system into the upper Midwest and Plains States. Then, warmer southeastern air stemming from the Gulf of Mexico is expected to shove it even harder toward the northern US.

Residents of Duluth, Minnesota saw warmer temps mid-week. Factoring in wind chill, the temp was 50 below-zero there on Tuesday, but had risen to 30 below-zero by Wednesday morning. The big storm from earlier, resulted in Minnesota Gov. Mark Dayton closing that state's roughly 2,000 public schools on Monday, a move not seen since 1997.

The city of Chicago was hit by cold so severe, the high temperature there on Monday was -11(F). Its low for the day was a record setting -16(F). But temps are predicted to reach as high as 25 degrees Fahrenheit on Thursday. Earlier in the week, a Texas man told Wikinews, "Geez, I moved south to get away from the cold. Maybe I need to move back north again."
