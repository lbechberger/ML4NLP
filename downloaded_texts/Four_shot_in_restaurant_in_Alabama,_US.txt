Shortly after nine PM last night a gunman walked into the T.G.I. Friday’s on University Drive in Huntsville, Alabama and opened fire on a table where Tanqueray Beavers, Thurston Turner, Autora Rogers, and William Reliford sat. The suspect was reported fleeing the scene in a 1970’s era black Chevelle with silver racing stripes and chrome wheels. Huntsville Police stopped a car matching this description and took the driver, Jamal Woods, into custody for questioning.

It has been confirmed that one of the victims, identified by friends and family at the scene as Tanqueray Beavers, died at the scene. The three others wounded in the attack were taken to Huntsville Hospital and are listed to be in critical condition.
Investigators are not releasing any information regarding a motive for the shooting, but Huntsville Police have charged Jamal Woods with murder.
