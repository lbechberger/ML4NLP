Nintendo's widely popular game system the Wii was hit by a decrease in sales in Japan. Nintendo hopes to regain its sales by releasing a new version of its Wii Sports game in June. The current CEO of Nintendo said in a press conference they will not be slashing prices of their hardware. "If our products are not much different from competitors', price cuts would generate significant fresh demand. But video games are just not that kind of product."

As of December 31, 2008 the Wii leads the generation over the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in worldwide sales.

The Wii's competitor the PlayStation 3 for the first time exceeded sales in 16 months in Japan for the month of March. 

The Wii Sports Resort and other new games and software will show up in Japanese stores in June to renew interest in the Wii.
