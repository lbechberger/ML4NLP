It was his fifth victory in the 2010 season of the US's leading professional stock car series, drawing him level with Denny Hamlin for the most wins. The victory earned Johnson 190 points (including a 5 point bonus), moving him closer to point leader Kevin Harvick, but he is still 105 points behind in second position. 

With eight laps remaining, Kurt Busch, who was running second, bumped Johnson to become the leader, but Johnson returned the favor a couple laps later to the lead the final two laps. Johnson said, “Kurt knocked me out of the way. At that point, I thought, I don’t care if I win or finish. I’m going to run into him one way or the other ... I tried once and moved him. (I thought) I’ve got to hit him harder. The second time I did and moved him out of the way.” Tony Stewart finished in the second position, ahead of Kurt Busch and Jeff Gordon in third and fourth. Ryan Newman, Clint Bowyer, Dale Earnhardt, Jr., Joey Logano and A. J. Allmendinger 
 rounded out the top ten positions. The race had total of four cautions and sixteen lead changes among nine different drivers. Kasey Kahne led the most laps by leading 110.

Gordon, Kurt Busch, Matt Kenseth, and Burton followed in the top-eight points positions. Stewart move up one position after finishing second and is in the ninth position, as Greg Biffle fell to tenth. Mark Martin and Carl Edwards rounded out the top-twelve, and is currently in the Chase.
