A woman detained after an evacuation at a U.S. airport in Huntington, West Virginia, has been cleared of all charges after further tests revealed that the liquid contained in water bottles in her carry-on luggage was not explosive. This result came despite earlier tests which seemed to indicate explosives were present.

The evacuation affected 100 people. The woman, who is of Pakistani descent, has been cleared by U.S. authorities to travel as early as Friday.
