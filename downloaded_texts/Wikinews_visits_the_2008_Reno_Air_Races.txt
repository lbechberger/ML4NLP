The last pass is flown, the final lap completed, the winner has long since left the circle with "Gold Unlimited" race trophy. The only thing left of the 45th National Championship Air Races &amp; Air Show, in Reno, NV is the awards dinner, which will take place away from the airfields and hangars, and the photos and memories of the event.

The week's festivities and hard fought races came to its climax on Sunday with the final races for the Biplane, Formula One, Jet, Sport, T-6, and Unlimited classes. This year saw some of the fastest races in its history as records were set in 4 classes; the Biplane Gold at 251 mph, the Jet Gold at 510 mph, the T-6 gold at 244 mph, and the Sport Class SuperSport Gold at 392 mph.

The highlight of the week was, of course, the Unlimited Gold Class race. The winner was Bill 'Tiger' Destefani in the P-51D Mustang, Strega. He finished the 8 lap, 66.9 mile course with a fastest lap of 483 mph. Additionally, this is Destefani's 7th championship as well as his last year of racing. The Second and Third places went to Dan Martin in Dago Red and Michael Brown in September Fury, respectively.
