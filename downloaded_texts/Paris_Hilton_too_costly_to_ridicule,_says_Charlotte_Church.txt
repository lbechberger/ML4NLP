Opera singer-turned-talk show host Charlotte Church wanted to book hotel heiress Paris Hilton on her program, to insult her. Church says Hilton is too expensive though, charging USD$650,000 for an appearance, and her producers dropped the idea.

Church told a British radio show "We asked Paris to be on the program because I could take the mick out of her and not feel at all bad about it — she's such a complete airhead. But she demanded a ridiculous amount of money — like the price of a big house just to say a few stupid things. She's hardly going to announce anything world-changing, is she? It's absolutely pathetic, isn't it?"

The Charlotte Church Show has aired on Britain's Channel 4 since September 1, 2006.
