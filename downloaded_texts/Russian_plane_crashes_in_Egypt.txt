A Russian plane crashed on Saturday in the Sinai Peninsula of Egypt, killing all 224 passengers and crew. The Airbus A321, operated by Metrojet, was flying from the Red Sea resort of Sharm al-Sheikh to Saint Petersburg, Russia. According to one of the security officials who was sent to investigate the crash, described that the plane was "completely destroyed" and he believes that none were able to survive the crash.

The plane's registry number was KGL-9268. One of the security officers who was sent on a rescue mission told in an interview with Reuters that they were able to hear sounds on the plane. 

An officer who asked to remain anonymous during an interview commented that the scene was truly tragic, some bodies were found buckled in their seats. 

The Egyptian rescue teams were able to uncover 100 corpses buried in the plane debris. One of the rescuers told in an interview that they are trying to enter small spaces of wreckage (where they heard voices) to uncover possible survivors. The officers were able to uncover a black box which contains all the plane's credentials.

According to the aviation ministry, the plane was flying 9,450 meters above the ground, and then it suddenly disappeared from the radar screens. Most of the passengers were Russian citizens.
