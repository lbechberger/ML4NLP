Bob Woolmer, Pakistan's cricket coach died at a university hospital in Kingston, Jamaica earlier today. Woolmer was found unconscious in his room at the Pegasus Hotel at 10:45 Sunday morning, only hours after Pakistan's Cricket World Cup exit at the hands of Ireland.

After being found by hotel workers in his room, he was rushed to the emergency department at the University Hospital in Kingston, but doctors where not able to save him. Team spokesman Parvez Mir reported that when he was found "He had blood on him and there was vomit on the walls."

Mir also told media that Woolmer suffered from a medical condition, but that it was too early to decide whether or not it had anything to do with his death.

Woolmer played 19 Tests for England and was the coach for Warwickshire and South Africa before becoming coach for Pakistan in 2004. He was to remain coach until after the 2007 World Cup, and was tipped to replace Duncan Fletcher as the coach of England after his contract with the PCB expired.
