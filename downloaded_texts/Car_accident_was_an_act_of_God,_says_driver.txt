A man from San Antonio, Texas in the United States, is being charged with assault with a deadly weapon and aggravated assault after he ran a woman off the road. The driver who caused the accident told police that God told him to do it.

Police say that Michael E. Schwab claimed that while he was driving on U.S. Highway 281 in Texas, God told him to run the unnamed woman off the road because she "wasn't driving right" and "needed to be taken off the road." He slammed into her car at over 100 miles per hour, spinning both vehicles into the median.

"God must have been with them, 'cause any other time, the severity of this crash, it would have been a fatal," said Kyle Coleman, a spokesman for the Bexar County sheriff's department.

Police say that Schwab was not drunk, and they found no illegal drugs inside his car. He is expected to undergo a psychiatric evaluation. Neither of the individuals suffered serious injuries.

God has faced scrutiny in the past, including a recent lawsuit that was thrown out of court. A judge in Nebraska, USA had dismissed a lawsuit in October that was filed against the higher power. In 2007, Nebraska state Senator Ernie Chambers, who represents legislative District 11 in North Omaha, filed the lawsuit alleging God was responsible for "widespread death, destruction and terrorization of millions upon millions of the Earth's inhabitants."
