Police arrested over two dozen anti-war protesters for demonstrating without a permit in front of the White House in Washington, DC on Wednesday. 

The rally consisted of protestors organized in a "die-in", appearing to be deceased. The peace rally was performed shortly after reports that the death toll for U.S. soldiers serving in Iraq reached 2,000.

The left-leaning MoveOn.org led a national campaign to galvanize anti-war vigils. Organization members on their e-mail lists received a notice Wednesday that read: "Dear MoveOn member, Yesterday we reached the sad milestone of 2,000 killed in Iraq. But for the most part, the national media are ignoring this tragic milestone."

Phyllis Bennis of the Institute for Policy Studies said that changes in U.S. public opinion are showing signs that peace activists are "beginning to give voice to the majority in this country." 

Among those arrested was activist Cindy Sheehan. She was arrested for the same offense in another anti-war demonstration just last month.
