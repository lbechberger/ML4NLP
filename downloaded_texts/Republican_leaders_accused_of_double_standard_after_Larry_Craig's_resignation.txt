Republican leaders have been accused of double standards after forcing Idaho Senator Larry Craig to resign, while letting Louisiana Senator David Vitter stay, after being accused of being involved in an escort service.

According to Democratic leaders, they let Vitter stay in as he would be replaced with a Democrat, whereas Craig will be replaced with a Republican. The Republicans have responded stating that Vitter had not been found guilty or charged, only accused.

"The fact is that Sen. Craig pled guilty to a crime, and therefore was convicted of a crime. Sen. Vitter has not been charged with a crime, let alone convicted of one. So there's a pretty big distinction here." said Ed Gillespie, President George Bush's counselor and ex-Republican party leader. He stated that by 2008, the party "will not have candidates who have any kind of ethical considerations that will be a concern to the voters".
