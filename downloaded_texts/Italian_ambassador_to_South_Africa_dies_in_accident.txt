The Italian ambassador to South Africa died in a car accident Saturday while hunting and on a game viewing safari in Limpopo province. At least two others were injured, one seriously.


Alessandro Cevese, 57, was traveling in a vehicle when it maneuvered to miss hitting an antelope. It is reported to have crossed the dirt road they were traveling on and when attempting to miss hitting it, the vehicle overturned and Cevese was thrown out of the car.

"The ambassador was flung from the car window and died instantly," said counselor Pier Folano. Authorities will be performing a culpability homicide investigation into the accident.

Cevese had served as Italy's ambassador to Lesotho, Mauritius and Madagascar and South Africa since July 2006. He was an attorney with experience in diplomacy.

Cevese is survived by his wife and three children.
