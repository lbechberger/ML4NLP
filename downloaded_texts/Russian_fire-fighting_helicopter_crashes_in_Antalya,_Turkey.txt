Since mid-August, the forest fires have swept the Southern part of Turkey including popular tourist destinations like Bodrum and Antalya-Kas. Lately the General Directorate for Forestry has sent short text messages through Turkish operators for citizens to be aware of forest fires. Amid warnings another fire started in Kas during the weekend.
