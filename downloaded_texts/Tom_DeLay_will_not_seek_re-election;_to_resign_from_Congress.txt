According to various news reports, former United States House Majority Leader Tom DeLay (R-Texas) will announce his withdrawal from the Congressional race on Tuesday, April 4, 2006.

In an interview on Monday, April 3, 2006, DeLay spoke with Time Magazine's White House correspondent Mike Allen, revealing his plans to give up his bid for re-election to the House seat representing the 22nd District in Texas. In addition, DeLay said that he plans to leave Congress in the next few months, though he has not yet decided on the date.

DeLay's office released a taped statement to media outlets on April 4, 2006 that addressed his decision to resign from Congress. "I will make that resignation effective sometime before mid-June, but largely dependent on the congressional calendar. I plan to begin focusing on the next phase of my life as a private citizen." DeLay's statement points to "negative, personal campaign[ing]" by "liberal Democrats" as a reason behind his resignation. He plans to determine "new ways from various arenas outside of public office that will allow me to continue to contribute to and engage in the policy, political, and cultural issues of national importance to the conservative majority." DeLay will be moving from Texas to his property in Virginia in order to be closer to Washington, DC. 

DeLay has served in Congress for 11 terms. He temporarily gave up his seat as House Majority leader in 2005 after he was indicted in Texas on money laundering charges and then permanently relinquished his House leadership position in January 2006. DeLay has allegedly been linked to lobbyist Jack Abramoff, who in January 2006 entered a guilty plea to charges of conspiracy to corrupt public officials, mail fraud, and tax evasion.
