Sony is delaying until November the release of its new PlayStation 3 video game console, for all countries. PlayStation 3 was supposed to be released this Spring, but the president of the Sony gaming division, Ken Kutaragi, says the company has decided on improvements since they last announced the release date. He says that Sony wants to include all the latest technology available today, and indicated that the system will run Linux out of the box The new, later release date could be advantagous to rival Microsoft Corp., which released its competing Xbox 360 console recently. Sony's Australia/New Zealand managing director said the PS3 release in New Zealand is still six to 18 months away.
