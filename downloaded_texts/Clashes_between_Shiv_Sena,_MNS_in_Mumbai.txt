Shiv Sena party workers clashed with their counterparts from the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena in Mumbai, leaving four people injured. The trouble began when MNS activists allegedly tore down a poster of Shiv Sena chief Bal Thackeray outside the SIES college. The Shiv Sainiks retaliated by bringing down a poster featuring Raj Thackeray (Bal Thackeray's nephew and founder of the MNS) outside Raj Bhavan. The two groups faced off outside the Sena Bhavan in Central Mumbai and soon began pelting stones at each other.

The police had to resort to lathi-charges and the use of tear-gas to dispel the crowds. The situation calmed down after the appearance of Shiv Sena Executive-President Udhav Thackeray and his cousin Raj at the scene. Udhav even appealed to his followers to return to their homes, saying, "The police will take necessary action. This is happening because many people are joining us from MNS. The defections have started and that is why they are resorting to such actions,".

Nonetheless, shops in Dadar remained closed and traffic was diverted away from the area. The Rapid Action Force has been deployed to control the situation, and has asked for reinforcements. Four riot control units have also been dispatched to maintain the peace.
