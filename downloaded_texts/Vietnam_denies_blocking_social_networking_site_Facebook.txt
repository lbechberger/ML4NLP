The Vietnamese government have denied blocking the social networking site Facebook. For several days users of the Vietnamese version of the site have reported problems when trying to access their page. 

FPT, the state internet provider has said that they are working with several foreign companies to solve a problem blocking connection to US servers. But workers at several web firms have reported that the government has ordered them to block Facebook. 

In a statement released by Facebook they said they “would be very disappointed if users in any country were to have difficulties accessing its site”. 

Facebook was launched in 2004 and has over 300 million users. The site has previously been blocked by Syria, China, and Iran.
