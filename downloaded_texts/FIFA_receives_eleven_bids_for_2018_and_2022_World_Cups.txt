The countries vying to host the tournament are Australia, England, Indonesia, Japan, Mexico, Qatar, Russia, South Korea and United States, who have individual bids and the joint bids are from Belgium-Netherlands and Spain-Portugal.

Select bids are for 2018 and 2022 tournaments and two bids are just for the 2022 tournament. Qatar and South Korea are vying just for the 2022 tournament. The two winning bids will be chosen on December 2010 by the 24-man executive committee of FIFA.

Said FIFA president Sepp Blatter: "We are very pleased about the fantastic level of interest in our flagship competition, with all initial bidders confirming their candidature."

Among the individual bidders, England in 1966, Mexico in 1970 and 1986, Japan and South Korea in 2002, and the United States in 1994 have previously hosted the World Cup tournament. From the joint bidders, Spain hosted the tournament in 1982.
