YouTube user Chris Crocker experienced instant fame this week after posting a video on YouTube defending Britney Spears, titled "LEAVE BRITNEY ALONE!". The video is a two minute, eleven second top-down view of his face as he speaks against her exploitation for money.

It has attracted some media attention, with an interview by CNN and stories by such sources as MSNBC. Comments have been mixed, with a number of insults regarding his emotional defense and effeminate appearance, alongside more supportive statements concerning his message.

The video's popularity has drawn attention to his channel and older videos, which have experienced a sharp increase in viewers. As of 14 September, the original YouTube video was viewed nearly 5 million times (in addition to numerous mirrors elsewhere), received nearly 69000 direct comments (including unrelated or spam comments), and was favorited by nearly 11000 users. 

He has since posted a follow-up video about FOX News, speaking about how he has been mistreated by the media.
