Robert Pickton, one of Canada's most profilic serial killers, has been found guilty of all six counts of second-degree murder in connection of the deaths of women from the Downtown Eastide in Vancouver. 

The trial ran from January 22, 2007 to the reading of the verdict on December 9, 2007. Pickton had pled not guilty to all six counts against him, which were all originally first-degree murder charges.

Pickton had been apprehended to police in February 2002. His pig farm in Port Coquitlam was the site of the investigation of the murders of Sereena Abotsway, Mona Wilson, Andrea Joesbury, Georgina Papin, Brenda Wolfe and Marnie Frey.

Second-degree murder holds a sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole within 10 to 25 years. 

Twenty counts of first-degree murder held against Pickton will be dealt at a future date.
