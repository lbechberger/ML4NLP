On Saturday, June 2, referee Herbert Fandel abandoned the UEFA Euro 2008 qualification match between Denmark and Sweden. The match, which was being played at Parken Stadium in Copenhagen, was tied 3-3 with one minute to go in regulation time.

Denmark had fought back from a 3 goal deficit to tie the match, when Fandel awarded a penalty kick to Sweden and showed Christian Poulsen the red card for a flagrant foul. A Danish fan made his way onto the pitch and attempted to assault the referee, although he was at least partially restrained by Danish players. Sweden will likely be awarded a 3-0 victory by the UEFA. This and any other sanctions will be announced on Friday.

The fan, whose identity was protected by the judge at his arraignment, apologized to his countrymen, many of whom see him as a traitor. "People in Denmark hate me, but I have no feeling yet what the reaction in Sweden is, other than they of course believe I am an idiot," said the 29-year-old Dane who claims to have consumed 15 to 20 beers before the incident.
