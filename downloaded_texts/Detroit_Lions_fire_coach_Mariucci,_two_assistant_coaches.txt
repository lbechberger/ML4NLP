The Detroit Lions held a press conference this afternoon at their headquarters in Allen Park, MI to announce the termination of head coach Steve Mariucci, as well as offensive assistant coaches Pat Morris and Andy Sugarman, according to the Associated Press. Defensive coordinator Dick Jauron has been named interim head coach through the end of the 2005 season.

Mariucci has won 15 out of 28 games in nearly three seasons in Detroit. Before joining the Lions, Mariucci coached the San Francisco 49ers.

The Lions lost 27-7 to the Atlanta Falcons on Thursday, in their annual Thanksgiving Day game at Ford Field.
