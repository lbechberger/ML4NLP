Batting first Australia set a moderate total of 7 for 236. Opener Matthew Hayden showed a welcome return to form top scoring with 71 runs from 109 balls.

In reply New Zealand looked to be struggling at 5 for 113 but Hamish Marshall's innings of 76 from 69 balls brought them back into the equation, however the Australian pace combination of Brett Lee and Glenn McGrath took New Zealand's final 4 wickets cheaply in the 47th and 48th overs bowling the Kiwi's out for 226.
