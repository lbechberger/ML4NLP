Prince Harry has today been ordered to return home, after details that the 23 year old's front line engagement was leaked by an American website. The details of the Prince's engagement had previously been kept secret by many British and international news agencies, including the BBC and the Associated Press.

The leak of the information was said to be "regrettable" by the Ministry of Defence, however this meant that Prince Harry was ordered to return home due to fears for his, and the others in his unit's safety. Prince Harry will be flown home "immediately", after 10 weeks of front line service. During this he worked as a Joint terminal attack controller (JTAC) and was involved in major operations on the frontline against Taliban forces.

The media blackout was created to lower the risk to the royal, whilst in service in Afghanistan, and was the first large scale agreement of its kind. The media groups who signed up to the agreement were rewarded with interviews with the Prince.
