A man from Jonesborough in south County Armagh, Northern Ireland, was charged today with the murder of 29 people who died in the 1998 Omagh bombing, which injured in excess of 300 additional people. 

Sean Hoey, 35, appeared at the Craigavon Magistrates Court, saying nothing. His solicitor said his client strongly denies the charges, and that there is no evidence against him to support the charges. Hoey, who was also charged with 23 explosives offenses and conspiracy to murder security force members, was remanded to custody in Maghaberry Prison and is scheduled to appear, via video link from prison, before the Belfast magistrates on May 31.
