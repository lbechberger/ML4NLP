Yesterday in La Molina, Spain on the third day of competition at the IPC Alpine World Championships, slalom gold medal winning French skiers Marie Bochet and Vincent Gauthier-Manuel assisted in putting France in the medal count lead. This brought the total number medals won by French skiers to eight.

New Zealand, with only two skiers competing, earned its first medal of the competition when Adam Hall won a bronze in yesterday's slalom event. His teammate Corey Peters finished his first run in the slalom but notched a Did Not Finish (DNF) for his second run and did not rank.

Spain moved down the medal table after their medal favorite, Jon Santacana and guide Miguel Galindo Garcés, failed to finish his second run in the slalom. Other Spanish skiers also failed to perform yesterday with wildcard entry women's sit-skier Nathalie Carpanedo and men's sit-skier Óscar Espallargas earning a DNF during their first runs on a day that saw thirty-six skiers earn DNFs on their initial run down the course. Men's visually impaired skier Gabriel Gorce and guide Arnau Ferrer were disqualified in the first run for missing gate 61. Standing LW2 classified skier Úrsula Pueyo finished ninth and last in her group.

Yesterday was originally scheduled to be a day off for skiers, but the slalom event was cancelled Saturday due to poor conditions. Today is scheduled to be the Super Combined event.
