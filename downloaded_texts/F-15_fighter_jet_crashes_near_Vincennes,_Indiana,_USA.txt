In the United States this morning, an F-15 Eagle fighter jet from the Missouri Air National Guard crashed near Vincennes, Indiana. Reports say that the pilot successfully ejected prior to the crash and walked to first responders under his own power. The crash occurred in a sparsely populated area and there are no reports of injuries on the ground.

The pilot was taken to Vincennes Hospital to be checked for injuries.

The fighter jet was performing maneuvers with three other aircraft, none of which were involved in the incident. All four aircraft are part of the 131st Fighter Wing of the Missouri Air National Guard, flying out of Lambert Field in St. Louis, Missouri. The training maneuvers were taking place at Military Operating Area Red Hills in southern Illinois and Indiana.

Resources from the Indiana Air National Guard 181st Fighter Wing from Terre Haute, Indiana, are securing the area surrounding the crash site. They will be joined by UH-60 Blackhawk helicopter support from the 38th Aviation Brigade of the Indiana National Guard from Shelbyville, Indiana.
