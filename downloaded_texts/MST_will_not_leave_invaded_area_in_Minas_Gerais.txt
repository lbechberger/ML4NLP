The members of the Brazilian Landless Workers Movement (Movimento Sem Terra, or MST) have decided they will not leave their camp, called Carlos Lamarca, an invaded area of Casa Grande farm. The farm is located at Esmeralda City, a metropolitan area of Belo Horizonte, in the Brazilian state of Minas Gerais. Since the judge Dr. Cláudio José Coelho's deadline time giving to them abandoning the area expired yesterday, the arrival of the police force could occur at any time. 

Helio do Carmo, a member of MST said, "At this moment, the important thing is staying at the camp and resist." Help is being provided by other MST camps in the region.

Belo Horizonte, a city of 2 million inhabitants, is the capital of Minas Gerais, a state in southeastern Brazil.
