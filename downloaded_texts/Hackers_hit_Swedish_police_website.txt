Hackers have brought the Swedish Police Service's website down. It is suspected this might be retaliation for the raid on The Pirate Bay on May 31.

The police's website went down on late June 1, after a Denial of Service attack sent large amounts of traffic to the site, causing it to crash.

Police spokesmen Lars Lindahl said today that a link with The Pirate Bay "is quite possible, but that is only speculation." He added that a criminal investigation has started.

It was later revealed a 17-year-old student, who claims “it only took 10 minutes”, carried out the attack that kept the site down for almost a day.
