British footballer David Beckham has arrived in Trinidad and Tobago amid fears of kidnapping. Beckham travelled to the island of Trinidad to watch the final of the FIFA women's Under 17s World Cup final and to launch a football festival for children. The stars arrival is also speculated to help England's bid for the 2018 World Cup.

Beckham's safety has come into question while he is visiting the island. Trinidad and Tobago have one of the highest murder and kidnap rates in the world. Beckham, who is reported to have a 125m fortune, could be a high target for a ransom kidnap. Upon his arrival, there were a numerous amount of police on scene as well as Beckham's own personal security team.

Along with FIFA president Sepp Blatter, Beckham watched the women's Under 17s World Cup final which saw South Korea defeat Japan to win the cup. The football festival he will host on Monday has gained criticism from officals. The host of the festival is the Marvin Lee Stadium; Lee was the captain of the Trinidad and Tobago national football team and died during a match in 2003 when he collided with Landon Donovan, a current teammate of Beckham.

Critism was also brought up over the choice of Beckham to host the festival. Trinidadian footballer Dwight Yorke is reported to have been upset with the choice of Beckham over himself or cricketing legend Brian Lara. The Trinidad Star newspaper said "If we are talking about inspiring youths, then why do we have to turn to Beckham when we already have someone from here who has achieved everything in the game."
