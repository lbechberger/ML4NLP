In a press conference this morning, the Metropolitan Police Service has announced that the death toll from yesterday's bombing has risen to "more than 50". (Initial reports had put it at 33, rising in later reports to 37.) Police are unable to give an exact figure at this moment due to the difficulty of removing bodies, and believe the figure is likely to rise. Some bodies have yet to be recovered from the Piccadilly line train caught between Kings Cross and Russell Square.

However speaking at the press conference, Metropolitan Police chief Sir Ian Blair said he did not expect the death toll to reach three figures. The total number of casualties remains at 700, with 350 requiring hospital treatment. Twenty-two people remain in hospital in a serious condition, with one person dying.
