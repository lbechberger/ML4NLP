The mayor of San Francisco, California, Gavin Newsom, has announced via Twitter that he will be running for the state's governor in the 2010 elections. He will be in the running to replace California's current governor, Arnold Schwarzenegger.

"It's official- running for Gov of CA. Wanted you to be the first to know. Need your help," said Newsom on his official Twitter profile. Newsom also posted a video on his campaign website which was launched earlier this morning.

"I hope that you will join our campaign that has set out to change California, because I know we can do better. We can't afford to keep returning to the same old, tired ideas and expect a different result," says Newsom in his campaign video.

Newsom promises more green technology, local economic stimulus and universal healthcare. His video doesn't mention anything about same-sex marriage, but Newsom is an active opponent of Proposition 8, California's ban on same-sex marriages.

Newsom has been San Francisco's mayor since 2003 and was re-elected in 2007.
