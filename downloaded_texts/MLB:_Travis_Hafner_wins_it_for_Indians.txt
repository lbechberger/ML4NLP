The Cleveland Indians pulled off a stunning win late in the game at Miller Park in Milwaukee, Thursday, defeating the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim. Travis Hafner, in the bottom of the eighth, hit a three run homer to erase the one score lead of the Angels. Orlando Cabrera was the only angel for the Angels as he had three hits on four at bats with two runs scored.

Pitching for Cleveland was pretty solid as Jeremy Sowers pitched seven innings, with one run on six hits with 27 at bats, one error, and three strikeouts. No home runs were give up by any of the four pitchers(Jeremy Sowers, Roberto Hernandez, Aaron Fultz and Joe Borowski) for Cleveland.

The same couldn't be said for the Angels pitchers squad, though. Dustin Moseley started for the LA Angels pitching six innings, allowing one run on five hits with 24 at bats, one error, three strikeouts, and one home run given up. It was not Dustin Moseley who gave up the game winning three run homer, but Scot Shields, the relief pitcher who let the game slide.

Aaron Fultz was the winning pitcher for the game, his second win of the young season. Scot Shields was saddled with his first loss of the season. The save was credited to closer Joe Borowski. 

The game was played in Milwaukee due to the snow storm in Cleveland the previous weekend.

Cleveland's next game will be a home game (this time in Cleveland) against the Chicago White Sox at 7:05 tonight, the first of a three game series. As the Angels well face the Boston Red Sox at 4:05 tonight, the first of a four game series.
