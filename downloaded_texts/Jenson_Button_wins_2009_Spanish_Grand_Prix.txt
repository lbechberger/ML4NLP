On Sunday, Brawn-Mercedes driver Jenson Button won the FIA Formula One 2009 Spanish Grand Prix at Circuit de Catalunya, MontmelÃ³, Spain. This marks his fourth win this season.

His teammate Rubens Barrichello finished second, who used a more efficient three-stop fuel strategy than Sebastian Vettel from Red Bull, who finished fourth. Australian Mark Webber also benefited from an earlier pit-stop to overtake his teammate Vettel.

Sebastien Vettel too chased down the Ferrari car of Felipe Massa, who unsuccessfully defended his position using his optional KERS regenerative brake. Massa was short on fuel and needed to slow on the dying laps of the race.

Both of Red Bull's cars finished after the two Ross Brawn team cars. Renault driver Fernando Alonso also slipped passed Massa on the last lap to secure 5th.

The top eight were closed out by two Germans: Nick Heidfeld racing for BMW Sauber and Nico Rosberg, representing Williams.

The drivers' championship leader is Jenson Button, who is 14 points ahead of his teammate and 18 ahead of Vettel. The constructors' standings are dominated by BrawnGP drivers with nearly 30 points lead over Red Bull.
