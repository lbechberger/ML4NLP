A "rogue" policeman from Afghanistan has shot down and killed five British soldiers in the Helmand province of South Afghanistan today. According to the government, the attack happened in the Nad-e'Ali District of Helmand. All the soldiers died from their wounds. The officer opened fire and injured several other troops, before fleeing the scene. At least eight others were injured.

"One individual Afghan National Policeman, possibly in conjunction with another, went rogue. His motives and whereabouts are unknown at this time," said a spokesperson for the UK armed forces. Authorities are still searching for a suspect.

Three of the soldiers were from the Grenadier Guards while the other two were from the Royal Military Police. They had been living with the police in a compound.

This raised the death toll of British troops killed in Afghanistan to 229 this year, the highest in any year since the 1982 Falklands War. Lt. Col. David Wakefield expressed his deepest sadness at the deaths. "Five British soldiers, five of our own, shot down in the course of their duty. They will not be forgotten," he said. 

British Prime Minister, Gordon Brown said,"The death of five brave soldiers in a single incident is a terrible loss. My thoughts, condolences and sympathies go to their families, loved ones and colleagues. I know that the whole country too will mourn their loss."
