The Gippsland Football League Semi Finals were played over the weekend. The Gippsland Football League (officially Gippsland League, GL) is the only major Australian rules football competition in the Gippsland region according to the Victorian Country Football League.

The Second Semi Final was traditionally played second, as the name suggests, but recent trends have seen it played first.

Maffra defeated Traralgon by six points after having a week off. Traralgon had defeated Morwell in the Qualifying Final the week before.

Drouin thrashed Morwell by eleven goals (66 points) in the First Semi Final to set up the Preliminary Final against Traralgon. Drouin had beaten Leongatha in the Elimination Final.
