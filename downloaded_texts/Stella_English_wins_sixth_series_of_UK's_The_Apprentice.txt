Stella English has been announced as the winner of the sixth series of British television programme The Apprentice. English was announced as the winner by host of the show, businessman Lord Alan Sugar, after the final task in which the two remaining contestants, English and Chris Bates, had to create and market a new alcoholic drink. 

English commented on winning the programme, saying: "There were times that I felt very tired and it was much harder than I ever thought it would be. But in terms of quitting, there was absolutely no way." She also said after winning the show that she hopes it will bring a "better quality of life" for her two children.

Lord Sugar also released a statement about his decision to hire English. "It's a very, very important job where you need a very, very good organiser and someone who's very, very switched on," he said. "She's got the brain to do it." He added there was a chance of employment for second place candidate Bates. English will be employed at one of Lord Sugar's companies; Viglen, a company that deals with IT services.

This series began to broadcast in October instead of it's regular spring slot due to concerns over Lord Sugar keeping his role on the show. Sugar was selected as a government advisor at the same time of the May general election.
