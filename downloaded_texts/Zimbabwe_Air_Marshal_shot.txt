The chief of the Zimbabwe Air Force has been shot in the arm in an apparent assassination attempt. Air Marshal Perence Shiri, 53, is recovering in a local hospital. 

Officials blame the incident on terrorists and political opponents. They also say that the assailant was trained in Botswana.

"The attack on Air Marshal Shiri appears to be a build-up of terror attacks targeting high profile persons, government officials, government establishments and public transportation systems," said Home Affairs Minister, Kembo Mohadi.

Shiri is a strong ally of President Mugabe. Many believe that Shiri masterminded the intimidation campaign used against the Movement for Democratic Change supporters during the 2008 presidential elections.
