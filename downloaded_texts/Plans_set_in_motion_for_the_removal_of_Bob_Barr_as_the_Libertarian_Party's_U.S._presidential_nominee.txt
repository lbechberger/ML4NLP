Controversies surrounding Libertarian U.S. presidential nominee and former congressman Bob Barr intensified on Friday afternoon.

There is now a serious effort by some in the Libertarian Party to remove Barr as its presidential nominee. In order for this to happen, the matter must be voted upon by members of the Libertarian National Committee. A motion has been written calling for Barr's removal and at least one representative has expressed a willingness to make it. If and when the motion is seconded, it will be brought to a vote. The motion can be read in its entirety below.

The motion is in response to Barr's refusal to attend former Republican presidential hopeful Congressman Ron Paul's third party unity conference at the National Press Club in Washington, DC on Wednesday.

Barr instead decided to hold a press conference of his own two hours after Paul's at the same location.

"I'm not interested in third parties getting the most possible votes," Barr told reporters. "I'm interested in Bob Barr as the nominee for the Libertarian Party getting the most possible votes."


Several of Barr's supporters were furious with his remarks, some even going so far as to retract their endorsements of him. Bloggers quickly picked up on the story and by Thursday evening there was an Internet frenzy, which continued into Friday.
