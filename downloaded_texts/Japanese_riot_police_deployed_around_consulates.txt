Japanese riot police were deployed on streets surrounding the Korean and Chinese consulates in the city of Fukuoka, the largest city on the south-western island of Kyushu. Sound trucks belonging to right-wing nationalist groups were circling the area and the police presence appeared to be an effort to control these groups. Police officers on the scene declined to comment.

Relations between Japan and its neighbors have been tense due to Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi's policy of visiting the Yasukuni Shrine, where the remains of Japanese soldiers killed in wars since the mid-nineteenth century are interred. Koizumi visited the shrine on October 17. Convicted war criminals from the Second World War are also interred at Yasukuni, so Prime Ministerial visits have been severely criticized by other Asian leaders. Territorial disputes between China and Japan have also increased tension in recent months.
