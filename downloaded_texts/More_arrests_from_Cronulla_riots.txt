New South Wales Police say a 21-year-old woman has been charged in relation to the riots at Sydney's Cronulla Beach last year. She is the first woman to be arrested over reprisals from the December 11 race-fuelled riot. The woman was charged with affray, assaulting police, resisting arrest and disobeying police direction. She was refused bail.

Police said the charges related to the violent and anti-social behaviour of a large number of people who gathered at Brighton-le-Sands on the night of the Cronulla riot. 

Three men have also been arrested in relation to the Cronulla riot. A 19-year-old man handed himself into police yesterday and is due to face Parramatta Local Court charged with riot and affray. 

A 21-year-old man from Cronulla also yesterday handed himself into detectives from Strike Force Enoggera, which was set up to investigate the racial unrest. The man was among the 20 whose photos were released to the media last week.

Another man, whose photo was release to the media, handed himself in to police last night. He was charged with riot and affray and given conditional bail to appear at Sutherland Local Court on April 6.

Police say Strike Force Enoggera has arrested 78 people to date, with 189 charges laid.
