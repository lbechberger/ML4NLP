The death of Bob Woolmer, Pakistan's cricket coach at the 2007 Cricket World Cup in the West Indies, has been officially labelled "suspicious" by the deputy commissioner of police, Mark Shields, in Jamaica today. 

"We are now treating [the death of Mr. Woolmer] as suspicious" he said at a news conference.

Bob Woolmer unexpectedly died in his hotel room in Jamaica last Sunday shortly after Pakistan's shock defeat at the hands of Ireland.
