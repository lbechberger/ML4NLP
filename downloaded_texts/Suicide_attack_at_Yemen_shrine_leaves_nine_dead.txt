Seven Spanish tourists and two Yemeni citizens are dead after a suicide attacker blew his vehicle up at a crowded temple dedicated to the Queen of Sheba in the Ma'rib Governorate. The blast also injured six more Spaniards. An official with the Yemen Interior Ministry has blamed the attack on al-Qaeda operatives.

Less than two weeks ago a terrorist disguised as a Yemeni guard opened fire on foreign oil workers who had just landed on an airfield. The United States embassy in San'a subsequently issued a warning to travelers because of the airfield incident.

The suicide attack at the Queen of Sheeba temple comes days after Islamic radicals twice unsuccessfully attempted to attack civilian areas in the United Kingdom.
