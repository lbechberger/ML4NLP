England have beaten West Indies by five wickets in the second Twenty20 international of the West Indies tour of England at The Oval, London, England.

England's victory tied the two match series 1-1 after West Indies won the first Twenty20 yesterday.

Chris Gayle got the West Indies off to a good start with 61 runs off 37 balls, but the England bowlers and fielders restricted their score to 169-7 after 20 overs despite some big hits from Marlon Samuels.

In reply, England faltered, losing three wickets in 14 balls followed by the dismissal of Kevin Pietersen for 19. However Owais Shah scored 55 to help England past the target.

The tour now moves on to a series of three One-Day International matches starting on 1st July. Earlier in the tour, England won a four match Test series 3-0.
