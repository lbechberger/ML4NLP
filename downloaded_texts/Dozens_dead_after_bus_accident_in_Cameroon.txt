At least thirty people are dead in Cameroon after a bus rolled over, reports say. The accident happened on Saturday near the city of Bafia, 135 kilometres or so north of the capital Yaounde.

The accident happened when the bus lost control, rolled down a hill into a ditch, and broke in half. Officials say the death toll may increase.

Traffic police official Fifen Idrissou told the Agence France-Presse news service: "At the scene we've identified around 30 bodies but the death toll could be much greater given that some of the injured evacuated before we arrived reportedly died. The bus lost control [...] 200 metres further on the bus hit a ditch. It rolled over several times," he said.

It wasn't immediately clear how many people were aboard the bus when it crashed.
