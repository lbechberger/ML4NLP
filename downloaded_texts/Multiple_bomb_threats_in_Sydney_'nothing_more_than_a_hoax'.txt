The Sydney police have declared that the numerous bomb threat e-mails circulating the city today were all hoaxes. The messages warned of a late afternoon bomb attack at Town Hall station. 

There were unconfirmed reports of evacuations at Town Hall Station, although it is not clear whether these were officially sanctioned, or just the result of word-of-mouth.

The police stated that there have been no evacuations. The Deputy Police Commissioner has said that the threats were "nothing more than a hoax", appealed for calm, and says that if any credible threats are received, the public will be kept informed and dealt with appropriately.
