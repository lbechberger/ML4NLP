Conduit, a subsidiary of the US directory assistance organisation kgb, is to create six hundred new jobs in the Welsh capital Cardiff by the end of 2012. Conduit is currently searching for 320 employees and intends to employ a further 280 this year.

In a statement, First Minister of Wales Carwyn Jones described the news as "yet another indication that Welsh government policies are having a beneficial effect supporting the economy and creating jobs during these difficult times", saying he was "delighted that Conduit is yet again expanding its operations in Wales." Edwina Hart, Minister for Business, Enterprise, Technology and Science, said she was "pleased that using the economic levers we have at our disposal, such as creating sector-specific enterprise zones, we continue to attract and retain world class business in Wales."

The new employees will work at Fusion Point, an office area in Cardiff city centre. Prior to this announcement, Conduit already had in excess of 1900 employees within three Welsh bases in Cardiff Gate, Swansea, and Cardiff city centre. This new contract has been created in association with a residential care service provided by British Gas.

Conduit Europe chief executive officer Denis Creighton said of the company's decision: "Wales delivers our best performance figures period. And that's why we're planning to focus future growth here."
