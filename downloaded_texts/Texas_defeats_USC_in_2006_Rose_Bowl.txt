The University of Texas Longhorns won the Rose Bowl and the 2005 National Championship with a 41-38 victory over the University of Southern California Trojans.

Texas quarterback and Heisman Trophy candidate Vince Young sealed the win with an 8 yard run on fourth down with 5 yards to go and 19 seconds remaining. The Longhorns followed the play with a successful two-point conversion.

Young rushed for 200 yards and passed for 267 yards in the game; his combined 467 total yards of offense set a Rose Bowl record. 

The victory by the Longhorns ended USC's 34-game winning streak â€” then the longest in the nation. With the win, the Longhorns now control the longest streak at 20 wins. The Trojans, coached by Pete Carroll, came into the game ranked no. 1 in both the BCS and AP polls. Considering USC's streak and the Longhorns no. 2 ranking, the Texas victory was considered an upset.

The morning of the victory President George W. Bush called Texas coach Mack Brown to congratulate the Longhorns and their victory.
