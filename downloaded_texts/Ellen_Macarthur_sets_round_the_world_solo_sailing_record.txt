British sailor Ellen MacArthur crossed the finish line today at 2229 UTC (and local time) to set a new world record for sailing solo around the world. Her 71 day, 14 hour, 18 minute, and 33 second voyage took her from the English Channel, south past the Cape of Good Hope, through the Southern Ocean, back past Cape Horn, and through the Atlantic. She shaved 32 hours off the previous record, set by Frenchman Francis Joyon in 2004.

On arrival in the English port of Falmouth, she was greeted by a crowd of thousands and full media array, the BBC extending its already considerable coverage, fronted by senior presenter Sian Williams - and told that on behalf Queen Elizabeth, she is to receive the award of Dame - and she also received the honorary title of Lieutenant Commander of the British Royal Naval Reserve.
