As part of the NBA all-star weekend, the National Basketball Development League held its second annual all-star game featuring the stars of the league who hope to receive a break on an NBA team.

The game was held in New Orleans, Louisiana and broadcast on NBA TV. The all-stars made up two teams, a blue team captioned by the winningest coach in NBA history Lenny Wilkins and a red team captioned by former Golden State Warriors great and member of the 50 greatest players of all-time, Rick Barry. The blue team won the game by a score of 117-99 over the red team.

After the red team won the first quarter the blue team dominated the rest of the game, led by 22 points from the gameâ€™s Most Valuable Player Jeremy Richardson of the Fort Wayne Mad Ants and formerly of the San Antonio Spurs. The red team was led by 20 points and 10 rebounds from Elton Brown of the Colorado 14ers.
