The bodies of 13 tribal villagers were found deep in the forest 22 km from a relief camp in the Indian state of Chhattisgarh. Police said on Saturday that Maoist rebels in Dantewada district took the 13 tribal villagers hostage at gunpoint along with 27 other natives earlier this week. The Maoists had slit the throats of the victims. India faces the problem of Maoist insurgency in many areas and the local peasants are harassed by both government authorities and the rebels.
