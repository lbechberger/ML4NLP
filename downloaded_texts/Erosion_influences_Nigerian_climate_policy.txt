Erosion in Nigeria has lead to increasing concern on climate policy for the entire country.


Areas in Nigeria have been subject to damages caused by increasing erosion for over 50 years. This issue has grown over the past years, and responsibility has been pointed at a lack of national policy.

However, locals recognize that they too contribute to the problem. "Some of the problem of erosion is created by our people, by our attitude to waste disposal. When we dump garbage in the drains that are built by the government we simply aggravate the problem of erosion," said state environmental commissioner Michael Egbebike.

"And this waste combined with the force of the flood and trying to erode the soil and sometimes they actually block the channel that has been created for flood dispersion and the floods come back and actually destroy their homes, and at that point they call on government," he added.

Geological studies of the area affected most by erosion, Anambra, have concluded that the cost of implementing a project which could effectively slow erosion are estimated at US$2 billion. Officials are looking for answers and help in funding a project at the Copenhagen environmental conference in December.

"We have a shortage of resources. The state is struggling because the monies spent on this erosion problem are huge sums of money. So we will of course need a lot of help from the international community and the federal government. Alone it would be a Herculean task for Anambra state," commented Egbebike.
