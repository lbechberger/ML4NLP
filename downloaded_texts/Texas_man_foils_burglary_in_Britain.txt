A Dallas, Texas man foiled a burglary in Liverpool, after spotting thieves trying to break into a shop. The man spotted the burglary using a webcam. He went online to view images of the city's famous Beatles quarter on Mathew Street, an area in Liverpool synonymous with the Beatles and home to the Cavern Club where the band regularly played.

The man saw intruders apparently breaking into a sports store. Then he telephoned the Merseyside Police. The police went to the scene and arrested 3 men.

"We did get a call from someone in Dallas who was watching on a webcam that looks into the tourist areas, of which Mathew Street is one because of all the Beatles stuff," a Merseyside Police spokeswoman said.

There was a ladder against a wall and a first-floor window had been broken, and the men were taking property out.

The men are all aged in their mid-30s. They are arrested on suspicion of burglary and bailed pending further inquiries.

The investigation is ongoing.
