The New Jersey Devils got their ride in the 2007 NHL Stanley Cup Playoffs started off right Thursday night, defeating the high-voltage offense of the Tampa Bay Lightning before 14,495 at Continental Airlines Arena, in East Rutherford, New Jersey.

Zach Parise, the Devils 1st pick (17th overall) in the 2003 draft, who led the team in scoring this season with 31 goals, scored twice in the game, including the winning goal off a pass from Jamie Langenbrunner. Vinny Lecavalier scored twice for the Lightning, but his efforts alone were not enough for Tampa. Martin Brodeur was solid as always in net for the Devils, notching 23 saves to pick up the win.
