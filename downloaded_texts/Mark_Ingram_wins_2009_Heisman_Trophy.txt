University of Alabama running back Mark Ingram has won the 2009 Heisman Trophy, it was announced Saturday night.

Ingram, the third consecutive sophomore to win the award for the top American Football player in NCAA Division I, was visibly emotional about receiving the award. The award was the first for Alabama.

The margin of victory was the closest ever for the award, with just 28 points separating Ingram from the second place finisher: Stanford running back Toby Gerhart. 
"I'm a little overwhelmed right now," Ingram said. "I'm just so excited to bring Alabama their first Heisman winner."

Ingram, who had 1542 yards rushing and 322 yards receiving this season, emerged as one of the favorites in the middle of the season, but it was the rough showings by fellow front-runners Tim Tebow and Colt McCoy in their conference title games that solidified Ingram's status and elevated Gerhart.

In the SEC title game, the second-ranked Crimson Tide defeated top-ranked Gators, holding Tebow to 184 yards through the air. In the Big 12 title game, Texas won a close game, 13–12 over Nebraska. In the game, McCoy had 247 yards through the air and was intercepted 3 times. A strong performance against in the same game propelled Nebraska defensive-end Ndamukong Suh to the fourth-place spot Heisman point total.

Ingram — who scored 18 touchdowns so far this season — will meet McCoy in the national title game Jan. 7.

Ingram also acknowledged the support of his family, his team and other students on campus.
"Everybody that's been in the Alabama family has been supporting me," Ingram said. "Walking to class, students flashed me the Heisman pose."
