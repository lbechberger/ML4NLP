Two women were injured today when an M&amp;M's balloon in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade hit a lightpost, causing the lamp atop the pole to fall upon two spectators. Two women, aged 11 and 26 were struck around 11:30 AM local time (1630 UTC) at West 43rd Street and Seventh Avenue. The women were visiting from Albany, New York to attend the parade. Neither sustained any serious injuries, and were released from the hospital by late afternoon.

Parade organizers were uncertain up to an hour before the parade began whether or not the participation of balloons would be limited. Conditions for the parade were windy, and there was a sprinkle of rain during the event, but it is unclear if the weather played a role in the accident. 

The annual parade had a similar incident in 1997, when a Cat in the Hat balloon hit a lightpost, making it collapse. Two serious injuries were reported, both of whom recovered.

The Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade has occurred every year since 1922, except from 1942 to 1944 during World War II.
