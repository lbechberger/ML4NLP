The United States of America warned Pakistan to remove restrictions on press which were implemented by the former president of Pakistan, Pervez Musharraf.

"We certainly think it would be a mistake for the Pakistani civilian government to follow the press intimidation that was present during its predecessor," said P. J. Crowley, State department spokesman. "We ourselves, who have been to Pakistan, have witnessed and interacted with â€” among the most vibrant media that exist anywhere in the world. The Pakistani press is very aggressive," he adds.

Two television stations, Geo TV and ARY, were shut down in Karachi and other parts of Sindh when the news reports telecasted by them angered the President's followers. Azher Abbas, Geo TV's managing Director, reported that their signals were blocked on Saturday after the broadcast of a news report saying that a pair of shoes were thrown at the president, Asif Ali Zardari, during his visit to Birmingham, England.
