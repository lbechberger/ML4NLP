Ariel Sharon's condition has worsened according to officials at the Chaim Sheba Medical Center where the former Israeli prime minister is being treated.

A new brain scan shows a deterioration in function according to hospital spokesperson Anat Dolev. His urine output has fallen and a chest scan indicates a new infection.

Ms. Dolev would not say whether Sharon's life was in danger.

Sharon, 78, has been in a coma since his stroke on Jan. 4 and his doctors have said his chances of recovery are very slim.
