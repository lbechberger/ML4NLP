A Japanese official has stated that Japan is opposed to re-entering into six-party talks between the United States, China, Russia, South Korea, and North Korea in regards to the N. Korean nuclear weapons program stating that N. Korea must "compromise."

"It's fine if North Korea can bring some contribution to peace, but simply starting talks is not meaningful," said the chairman of the Liberal Democratic Party's policy research council in Japan, Shoichi Nakagawa.

"The situation has changed since the last six-party talks in September last year. North Korea has conducted missile test launches and undertaken a nuclear test. Talks shouldn't re-open without careful consideration," added Nakagawa. North Korea successfully tested a nuclear missile on October 9, 2006.

"[We expect] early and concrete results. We believe it is necessary for North Korea to show concrete actions toward the abandonment of all nuclear weapons and existing nuclear programs," said Shinzo Abe, the Prime Minister of Japan.

Six-party talks are said to resume on December 18, 2006.
