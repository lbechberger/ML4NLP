A 56-year-old Israeli woman has been hospitalized after attempting to commit suicide by letting a high-speed passenger train run her over on Sunday. Security cameras caught the entire incident on tape.

The video shows the woman walking onto train tracks in the city of Beit Yehoshua as a railroad worker and bystanders watched her lie down. Seconds later, a train ran her over. After the train passed, the woman got up, brushed herself off, walked back to her car and drove away.

Authorities tracked the woman down and took her to a local hospital for treatment. She only suffered minor injuries to her head.

Police say she tried to end her life after losing her job as a travel agent.
