Environmentalists in Brazil are urging the country's residents to urinate in the shower while washing themselves, to help conserve water and save the rainforest. Television ads being aired in the country claim that by doing so, the nation could save over 1,000 gallons of water per household each year.

SOS Mata Atlantica ran the ad campaign in an attempt to use comedy to get people to reduce the amount of water they use. "[The ad is] a way to be playful about a serious subject," said Adriana Kfouri, a spokesperson for Atlantica.

The animated ad narrated by children shows people, including a trapeze artist, an alien and dancers, all taking a shower while at the same time, urinating in it. The ending of the ad then states, "Pee in the shower! Save the Atlantic rainforest!"

Ken Livingstone, former mayor of London, England, proposed a similar campaign in 2006. He said urine should be classified as a "green waste" and that "there is no earthly reason that you need to flush the loo if you have merely urinated. That's a huge saving of water."
