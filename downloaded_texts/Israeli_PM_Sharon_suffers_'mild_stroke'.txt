Hospital officials at Hadassah Ein Karem Hospital in Jerusalem announced that Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon suffered a temporary mild stroke Sunday evening.

"Our tests have shown that the prime minister had a mild CVA," (stroke) said Dr. Yuval Weiss, a spokesman for the hospital. Sharon briefly suffered some minor physical symptoms including slurring of speech and loss of some motor control.

Sharon was reportedly returning to his ranch in the Negev desert when he told aides he was not feeling well. He was rushed to hospital and admitted shortly after 8pm (18:00 UTC). The later statement of Dr Weiss stated that no invasive procedures were necessary.

Sharon's stay in the hospital is likely to be brief, some reports suggest he may be released in the morning although his personal physician, Boleslav Goldman has stated the stay may be three or four days. Despite hospitalisation, he is continuing to maintain full control of events in Israel.

Sharon has not previously suffered major health difficulties, although the BBC suggests
his stressful life and position may have contributed to the incident and surrounding scare.
