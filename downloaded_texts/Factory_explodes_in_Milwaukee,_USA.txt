At approximately 8:10 AM CST December 6, 2006 a factory owned by the FALK Corporation exploded in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. 

The blast could apparently be felt up to thirty miles away. A plume of smoke was seen rising from the explosion site, and the area around the factory was reported to smell of burning wood.

The explosion apparently occurred when a container of 72,000 gallons of propane exploded, destroying the building. Three people are confirmed dead and forty-six injured, with one person suffering life-threatening injuries, according to a press conference with Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett and Milwaukee Police Chief Nan Hagerty at 5:00 PM CST broadcast on WTMJ-TV in Milwaukee. Local news reports state that the three dead were aged 37, 49, and 38.

With a population of 596,000 (according to the 2000 Census), Milwaukee is the 19th largest city in the United States.

The factory had made industrial gears since the 1800s.
