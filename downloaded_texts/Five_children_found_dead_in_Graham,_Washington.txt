At least five children have been found dead in a home in Graham, Washington in Pierce County located in the United States. The bodies were found on Saturday after officials in neighboring King County found the body of their father who committed suicide by way of a self inflicted gunshot wound.

According to the Pierce County sheriff's office, the ages of the children, one boy and 4 girls, range from 7-years-old to 16-years-old and all were shot and killed. Police went to check on the children's health after King County sheriffs contacted Pierce County regarding the father's suicide, whose name has not been released.

Authorities believe the 35-year-old man killed all five children before he killed himself, but the motive is not yet known.
