Charles Martin, 66, of Union Township, Ohio called 911 on Sunday saying, "I just killed a kid. I shot him with a goddamn .410 shotgun, twice. He's laying in the yard." 

Police say Martin shot and killed Larry Mugrage, 15, a high school freshman, for walking onto his lawn on Sunday. 

"I've been harassed by him and his parents for five years. Today just blew it up," Martin told dispatchers when he called 911.

Martin has been charged with murder.

On Monday, Judge James Shriver ordered that Martin be held without bail. A hearing is scheduled for Thursday.
