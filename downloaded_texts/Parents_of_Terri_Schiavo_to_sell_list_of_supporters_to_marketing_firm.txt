A local news station reported the parents of the late Terri Schiavo, the Schindlers, are to sell a list containing the names of people who donated money to their fund. The fund was used to finance legal battles for keeping their daughter alive.

A spokesperson for the Schindlers confirmed the story.

The company who will receive the list, 'Response Unlimited', usually pays $150 a month for a list of 6,000 names, and $500 a month for a list of 6,000 e-mail addresses.

The Schindlers have declined to reveal how much money they will receive for their list.
