Local caterers get ready for big business, as almost three thousand fans converge on the David L. Lawrence Convention Center over the Independence Day weekend for the world's largest ever furry convention, Anthrocon 2007.

Many hope to renew acquaintances, or meet new friends. Others look to buy from dealers and artists, or show off new artwork or costumes. Some attend to make money, or even learn a thing or two. But one thing unites them: They're all there to have fun.


Anthrocon has a significant international draw. However, most are native English-speakers — of the 18 countries represented at the event, the USA, Canada and the UK make up over 98% of attendees.

While other countries have their own furry events, on average they're only about one tenth the size. The largest outside of North America is Eurofurence, which drew 405 in 2006. Anthrocon's closest competition is San Jose's Further Confusion, while Midwest FurFest in Chicago provides a third alternative, spurred by 35% growth last year. Anthrocon's own yearly growth was 14%.

Ontario's Feral! is set in a campground, but at Anthrocon hotels are a necessity. Many share four or (unofficially) more to a room, skirting the bounds of local fire codes. Part of this is due to the cost. Even at the discount rate, a night in the convention hotel is $125 after tax; furry fans are often young, with little money to spare.

Money isn't the only explanation, though. Furry fans are "social creatures", and for some Anthrocon represents the only time in the year when they can meet up with friends from around the world. When not attending a panel or watching fellow fans fursuiting, many can be found chatting, drawing or playing games in The Zoo — the convention's 24-hour social space. If it weren't for the discos, some might never leave.
