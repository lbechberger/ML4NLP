The eighth named storm of the Atlantic Hurricane Season, tropical storm Humberto, was named today over the Gulf of Mexico.

The tropical storm was about 70 miles south-southwest of Galveston, Texas at 2 p.m. EST and was moving towards the north at 6 mph.

Maximum sustained winds associated with the storm stood at 45 mph.

But, forecasters warn that additional strengthening is possible before the storm makes landfall.

While heavy rain is already pounding the Gulf Coast, Humberto's center is not expected to reach the coast of Texas until late tonight.

The National Hurricane Center (NHC) issued a tropical storm warning from Port O'Connor, Texas, to Cameron, Louisiana.

Anywhere from 5 to 10 inches of rain is expected along the upper and middle coast of Texas, as well as in southwestern Louisiana. Some areas to be impacted by the storm may see rain totals near 15 inches, according to the NHC.

Also, the NHC warned storm surge flooding of 2 to 3 feet is possible.
