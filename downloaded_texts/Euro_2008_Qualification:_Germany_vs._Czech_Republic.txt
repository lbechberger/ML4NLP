Czech Republic beat Germany 3-0 to advance to UEFA Euro 2008 today with goals from Libor Sionko, Marek Matějovský and Jaroslav Plašil. This was Germany's first defeat in 24 UEFA European Championship qualifiers which dates back nine years when Turkey beat Germany 1-0 on October 10, 1998.

Germany's first opportunity came three minutes after the opening goal but Bastian Schweinsteiger's long-distance shot went wide. Then afterwards Kevin Kuranyi missed two headers. Schweinsteiger continued his influence in the German attack which brought two saves out of Petr Čech before the Czech Republic sealed the points and their qualification with a break-away goal during the 63rd minute. Plašil collected a cross from Daniel Pudil and beat Hildebrand, who replaced the suspended Lehmann, to inflict Joachim Löw's 1st competitive defeat as Germany coach.

With Germany already qualifying after their 0-0 draw against Ireland, they look to finish on a high note when they play Cyprus and Wales next month.
