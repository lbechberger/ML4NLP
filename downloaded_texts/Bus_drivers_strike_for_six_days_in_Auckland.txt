Bus drivers at Stagecoach, the main busline in Auckland, began a six-day strike on May 5 after company and union representatives failed to reach a settlement. Traffic during rush-hour has become much more dense than usual, due to parents driving children to or from school. Extensive motorway roadworks in Auckland are in progress, as well as the usual rash of roadworks at the end of the annual council budgets.

Stagecoach employees are in disagreement with the new UK-based management over working practices and pay.
