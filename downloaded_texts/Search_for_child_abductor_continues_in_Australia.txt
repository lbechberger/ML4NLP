New South Wales Police are continuing the search for the man who abducted a six year old girl for a short period of time from the front yard of her Mount Austin home in Wagga Wagga, New South Wales, Australia on Sunday morning. 

The girl was playing in her front yard, when abducted by a man at approximately 11:30am (AEDT) on Sunday.
She tried to cling to a tree but the man overpowered her, placing her under his arm and then into the rear of his cab. The girl's screams alerted her mother and neighbours, with her mother getting a hold of the rear tray of the Toyota Hilux and being dragged along the road before losing her grip. 

It is believed a witness followed the vehicle for a short distance until losing sight of it.

The abductor returned the girl to a nearby street approximately 90 minutes after the abduction.

 
Superintendent Rod Smith told the media that the girl was "physically unharmed" but undergoing a "medical examination" with the family of the girl "suffering severe shock".

The man is described to be in his 40s with a solid build and receding light hair, driving a late model Toyota Hilux, white in colour with silver standard wheels and a yellow barrel in the tray. The car is believed to have plates starting with BD or DB.
