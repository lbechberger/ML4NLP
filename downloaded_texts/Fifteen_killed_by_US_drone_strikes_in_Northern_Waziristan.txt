Pakistani officials have stated that three US drone strikes have killed fifteen people in the country Saturday. The attacks occurred to the north of Miranshah town in the North Waziristan region.

Security officials in the town informed AFP that in the first strike, US drones fired four missiles on a car, killing seven suspected militants. A nearby "militant compound" was also destroyed by the missiles. "Three militants were killed in the car while four were killed in the house," the official said. The second attack occurred within minutes of the first, and four militants, who were carrying on rescue work were killed by the two missiles that had been fired. 

Intelligence officials believe that the militants were associated with Hafiz Gul Bahadur. "We are trying to establish identity of the militants but most of them are believed to be fighters of Hafiz Gul Bahadur," an official told the media. However, the death toll and the identity of those killed was not officially confirmed. A local official stated that they had heard reports stating "that four foreigners were also killed in these fresh attacks". However, he added that their identity is "still not known" and mentioned that they "are collecting more information."
