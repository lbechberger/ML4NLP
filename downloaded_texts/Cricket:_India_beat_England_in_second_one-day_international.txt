India have beaten England by nine runs in the second One-Day International of the series at the County Ground, Bristol, England.

India, having won the toss and elected to bat first, raced to 113 runs after the first twenty overs. Sourav Ganguly was caught off the bowling of Andrew Flintoff, who finished the innings as the top performing England bowler, taking 5-56. Sachin Tendulkar fell just short of a century, being caught behind on 99 runs. Tendulkar was surprised at the decision, and television replays were inconclusive as to whether the ball had hit his glove or not. Yuvraj Singh and Rahul Dravid added 63 runs before Singh was dismissed for 49. Dravid finished on 92 not out, helping India to an imposing total of 329-7 after fifty overs.

In reply England started quickly, recording 75 runs off the first ten overs. However Munaf Patel took two wickets in two balls to dismiss both the England opening batsmen. The England wickets fell regularly after that, with Kevin Pietersen and Paul Collingwood bowled by Piyush Chalwa for 25 and 27 runs respectively. Andrew Flintoff was dismissed for just nine runs, and despite 64 runs from Ian Bell, England needed 90 runs from the last eight overs with just three wickets remaining. Dimitri Mascarenhas hit 52 runs, including five sixes, and Stuart Broad hit 20 runs off the final over, but it came too late and England fell ten runs short of the 330 run target.

The seven-match series stands at 1-1 after two matches. The third match will be played at Edgbaston, Birmingham, on August 27.
