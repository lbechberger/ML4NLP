Hewlett-Packard's chairman and board member, Patricia Dunn has resigned following a pretexting scandal in which she hired private investigators to discover the source of media leaks by using false identities to obtain telephone records from service providers.

Chief Executive Mark Hurd will replace Dunn as chairman, effective immediately. In a statement made by the company, Dunn resigned at the request of her fellow board members. 

Hurd stated that Hewlett-Packard has hired Bart M. Schwartz, a former U.S. prosecutor, as legal counsel, to review the methods used in trying to find out sources of media leaks.
