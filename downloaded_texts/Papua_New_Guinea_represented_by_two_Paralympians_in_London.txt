London, England â€” With the 2012 Summer Paralympics starting in less than a week, parts of Papua New Guinea's Paralympic delegation arrived in London earlier today in order to support the pair of athletes the country qualified for the Games, athletics competitor Francis Kompaon and powerlifter Timothy Harabe.

The Games are Kompaon's second, having competed at the 2008 Summer Paralympics where he earned his country's first Paralympic medal when he finished second in the 100 metre event. Harabe, only the tenth person ever to represent his country at the Games, is making his Paralympic Games debut.

The British High Commissioner to Papua New Guinea, Jackie Barson, MBE, wished both athletes well, saying in a written statement, "It is a fantastic achievement for the PNG to be represented by two world class Paralympic athletes".

PNG Paralympic Committee President Bernard Chan also congratulated his country's athletes, saying, "They will be great ambassadors for PNG and I hope both Francis and Timothy will inspire other athletes to train hard and hope to represent PNG at this Paralympic level during their participation."

The 2012 Games will be the fourth time the country has participated, with the three other appearances happening at the 1984 Summer Paralympics, 2000 Summer Paralympics and 2008 Summer Paralympics. Other members of the Papua New Guinea 2012 Paralympic delegation include PNG Paralympic Committee President Bernard Chan; Chef de Mission Dr. Kefu Ma; team manager Rosemary Mawe; Davina Chan, the president's wife; coach William McKenny; and official Jeffrey Robby.
