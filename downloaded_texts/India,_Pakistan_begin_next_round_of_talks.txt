India and Pakistan began another round of confidence building talks in the capital today. The focus of the talks is on improving contact and communication between the militaries of the two countries.

The two sides had reached an agreement over the weekend to share information with each other before any ballistic missile tests. Already there is an agreement for the two sides to inform each other before military exercises and violations of air space. There is also talk of upgrading those lines between Director General's Military Operations.

Participants will also review the progress made after the 2003 ceasefire at the borders.
