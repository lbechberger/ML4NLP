Lebanon warned the U.N. today that the U.S.â€“French drafted UN Security Council resolution will not end the on-going conflict in Lebanon. The conflict between Israel and Hezbollah has left thousands homeless and threatens more. The resolution calls for a long-term buffer zone between Southern Lebanon and Northern Israel. Also the draft demands full cessation of all hostilities but makes no mention of any Israeli withdrawal, which is one of the points of Lebanese Prime Minister Fuad Siniora's seven point proposal for ending the crisis.

Mitri who is Lebanon's ministry of culture also demands a clear statement that Israel must withdraw.

Yesterday U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice was quoted as saying, "We're trying to deal with a problem that has been festering and brewing in Lebanon now for years and years and years, and so it's not going to be solved by one resolution in the Security Council." Rice also emphasized that the resolution is a first step for a better future in the on-going conflict.
