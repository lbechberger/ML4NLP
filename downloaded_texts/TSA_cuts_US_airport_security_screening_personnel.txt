U.S. airline passengers may need to brace for longer lines at security screening checkpoints as the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) announced plans to reduce the number of security screeners in US airports. The cutbacks come despite an increased TSA budget for 2006 over 2005 and an overall increase in airport traffic. 

The Portland, Oregon and Medford, Oregon airports were among the hardest-hit by cutbacks, with Portland seeing a 30% decline in security screeners.

Travellers are advised to check with the TSA or the airport to plan for delays at check-in.
