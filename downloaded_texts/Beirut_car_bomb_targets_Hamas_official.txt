A car bomb went off in the Lebanese capital of Beirut Saturday. Two people were killed and three injured when device detonated in the southern suburbs of the city, an area where Hezbollah support is strong. The neighborhood of Haret Hreik was cordoned off by Hezbollah, preventing journalists from entering.

According to one source, Ali Barkah, Hamas' Southern Lebanon Chief was killed. He is rumored to be the target of the bomb, according to Arab media. Lebanon's State News Agency claim "three bombs tied to each other were placed under the vehicle". 

The bomb was detonated about 700 meters from a building in which Shiite supporters of Hezbollah were holding a ceremony for Ashoura on the eve of the event, Shiite Islam's most important religious holiday.
