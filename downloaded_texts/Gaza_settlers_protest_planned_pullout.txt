Israel's Independence Day was marked by protests around Gaza Strip as nationalist Israelis rallied against the dismantling of 21 settlements in the region. The protests where peaceful as many marched or even held picnics in the settlements. Police estimated a turnout of about 35,000 but organizers estimated much higher numbers. This comes after similar, larger protests against Ariel Sharon's plan to end conflict with the Palestinians over the area.
