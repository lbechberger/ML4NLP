Spectators flocked to the Canadian Warplane Heritage Museum, beside the John C. Munro Airport in Hamilton, Ontario on Sunday to see restored Canadian warplanes in the sky as part of the annual FlyFest airshow.

Included among the day's attractions, was one of two remaining flight-worthy Avro Lancasters, which was open to visitors to climb into the cockpit for a small fee. Other craft included a Messerschmitt 109, B-25 Mitchell and PBY Canso. 

The non-profit museum is dedicated to restoring old Canadian warplanes from the past 75 years. Normally stored in the museum's display rooms, some of the planes make it out to airshows when finances allow. 

They were flown all day from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. EST.
