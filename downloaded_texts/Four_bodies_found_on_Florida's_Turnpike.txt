Florida Highway Patrol says that the bodies of four people, two adults and two young children, were found on the Florida's Turnpike a few miles south of the I-95 interchange in Fort Pierce, Florida.

Highway Patrol Troopers received a call around 8 a.m. from someone who spotted the bodies of a male and female adult, who were both in their 20's to 30's, and a male and female child, between the ages of 4 and 6, on the southbound side shoulder of the Turnpike.

St. Lucie County Sheriff Ken Mascara said that the victims had been shot multiple times. Mascara also said that no vehicle was found, but there were tire tracks nearby.

The Sheriff's office says that they think the bodies were shot on the scene because of the posture of the family. The mother's body was found holding on to the children on either side of her.

The area where the bodies were found is near the St. James Golf Club as well as several home developments. A resident of a nearby housing development reportedly heard shots or fireworks around 3 a.m.

The turnpike has several traffic cameras in the area, however Sheriff Mascara says they were not recording at the time.
