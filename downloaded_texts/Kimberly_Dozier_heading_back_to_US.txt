CBS reporter Kimberly Dozier, who was wounded May 29 in Iraq is on her way back to the United States, where she will be admitted to the Bethesda Naval Hospital close to Washington D.C. She was apparently very responsive, and was "talking animatedly."

Col. W. Bryan Gamble, a spokesman at Landstuhl Regional Medical Center in Germany where Dozier had stayed in intensive care for much of the past week, said her progress has been "encouraging." While Dozier was in Iraq working on a report about American Forces in Iraq on Memorial Day, she was wounded from a car bomb that actually killed Paul Douglas, a camera operator, and James Brolan, an audio technician, as well as an American soldier and an Iraqi interpreter.

CBS has reported that she remembers the explosion, possibly indicating that she doesn't have any significant brain damage.
