Police in Kemah, Texas arrested a man on Wednesday for riding a unicycle while nude. The city's chief of police told sources that the man, Joseph Glynn Farley, 45, of Clear Lake, Texas had been falling off his unicycle repeatedly while riding across a bridge. Police stated the man was not intoxicated at the time of his arrest, but simply told them he liked how riding the unicycle while nude felt. 


Police had stopped Farley earlier in the day on Wednesday, and warned him to stay in his lane while riding, as he was creating a hazard for motorists. During that encounter, Farley was clothed. When Farley was arrested, his clothes were later found near the foot of the bridge. The man's father said Mr. Farley suffers from a mental illness, and refuses to take medication or participate in therapy. He also said Mr. Farley often has trouble distinguishing proper versus improper behavior, due to his illness.

A popular tourist destination, the Kemah Boardwalk is located about 20 miles from downtown Houston. The Boardwalk is adjacent to Galveston Bay.
