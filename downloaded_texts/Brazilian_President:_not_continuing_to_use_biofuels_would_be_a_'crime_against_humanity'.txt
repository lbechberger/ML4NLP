Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, the president of Brazil, said on Wednesday that not continuing to use biofuels would be a "crime against humanity."

"Don't tell me, for the love of God, that food is expensive because of biodiesel," said Lula, when talking to reporters.

Lula also stated that he was ready for a debate on biofuels. "Brazil is prepared for this debate. I and my government are ready to travel around the world," he said.

This move comes soon after a press release was made available by the European Parliament saying that "in the last year scientific evidence, though disputed, has indicated that biofuels may not be as good for the environment as was once thought."
