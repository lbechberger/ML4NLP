The third day of New York Fashion Week debuted styles infused in '70s couture, punk and hard rock roots. Labels Herve Leger, DKNY and Rock &amp; Republic unveiled their Fall 2008 lines, and continued the retro bent popular in the first two days of the world's largest fashion show.

Max Azria's Herve Leger label showed off his signature skintight dress in multiple styles Sunday, experimenting with knit fabric as well as coats to complement the dress. Unafraid to take risks, Azria also unveiled elaborate variations which called for sequins, ribbons and large bows, the latter of which was another nod to late '70s fashion. Model Padma Lakshmi walked the runway for Azria, as did actress Sophia Bush and singers Joss Stone and Mandy Moore.

DKNY, the main label for designer Donna Karan, took the idea of '70s couture and modernized it, deeming her Fall collection "eclectic glamour." Retro styles such as bow blouses, pants bordering on the bell-bottom design, and peasant fashions were interspersed with more modern knits, silk and plaid designs for tops, dresses and jackets, respectively.

Rock &amp; Republic's theme was "gangster chic," and was the biggest contributor to the hard rock feel. Unlike most shows, a complete orchestra with baby grand piano set the soundtrack for the show, which unveiled designs almost exclusively in a somber black. Designer David Cardona was credited with the rock designs, which included black suits and trenchcoats, and are a departure from the high-end denim looks the label is usually known for.

New York Fashion Week runs until Friday. On Monday Carolina Herrera and Betsey Johnson are considered to be the biggest draws at Bryant Park.
