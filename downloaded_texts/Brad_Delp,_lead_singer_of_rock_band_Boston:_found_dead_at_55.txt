The lead singer of Boston, Brad Delp was found dead in his house alone last Friday.

The Atkinson police have stated that there was no "foul play" involved, and the cause was still under investigation by the medical examiner.

After the death, the bands website went down and was replaced with the message: "We just lost the nicest guy in rock and roll."

Delp joined Boston in the ealry 70's after meeting with guitarist, songwriter and producer Tom Scholz. The group later signed with the Epic label.

Their first album, which was self titled, was a huge success. The album had hits on it such as "Long Time" and "More than a Feeling".

Delp left the band in 1991, and was replaced by Fran Cosmo. Delp rejoined the band later for the Walk On tour, and shared vocal duties with Cosmo. A new album with Delp singing was reported to have been in the making, but no release date was ever given.
