Martin Bionics, a company based out of Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, was awarded the patent to a computer-controlled ankle. The Oklahoma Center for the Advancement for Science and Technology funded $573,000 towards the development of the device.

The computer-controlled ankle functions similar to how the brain controls a real human ankle. Although prosthetic ankles allowed for some basic performance, the technologies remained limited in where and how they may be used.

Vice president of research and development, Jay Martin, said "This design grants a greater sense of security and confidence to the amputee. Functioning at a higher level, walking with a smoother step and dressing without limits will provide the patient with greater self confidence."

Martin Bionics plans to have the ankle commercially available within the next two years.
