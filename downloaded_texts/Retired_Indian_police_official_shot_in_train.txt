An armed gang killed a retired IPS officer and looted cash and valuables from passengers in an air-conditioned compartment of the Rajendra Nagar - Lokmanya Tilak Superfast Express near the Patna junction, an official said. The six robbers, who were armed with five guns were arrested by the Government Railway Police Karbigahiya and Mithapur localities. Superintendent of Railway Police G.P Sinha said that Anil Kumar Singh was shot when he resisted the gang's attempts to steal his belongings. 

As the news spread, railway personnel rushed Singh to a Patna Medical College hospital where he was declared dead. The GRP acted on a tip provided by one Rinku, who was among those arrested in the train itself, and took his fellow thieves into custody. Some articles, including wallets and suitcases, looted from the passengers during raids were recovered by the GRP. 

Anil Kumar Singh had retired from the police force at the rank of DIG. He was also a practicing lawyer at the Patna High Court. Mintu, the attacker who had fired at Singh was also arrested. The train was allowed to resume its journey after being stopped for a few hours at the Patna Junction.
