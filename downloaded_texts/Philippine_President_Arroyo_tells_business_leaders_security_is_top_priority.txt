Philippine President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo assured local and foreign investors in the country that the government has placed national security on its top priority as alert levels against possible terror attacks were raised in the capital region Metro Manila and in Mindanao island.

Arroyo while speaking before the 8th CEO Forum of the Semiconductor and Electronics Industries in the Philippines in Makati City asked for help and more information on any possible terror cells in the country. Arroyo emphasized that, "The strong cooperation between the vigilant public and our security forces will deny the terrorists any room to carry out sinister plots."

Six people were killed and thirty others were injured during separate bomb attacks in the provinces of Sultan Kudarat and North Cotabato in southern Philippines.

Government security forces have blamed the terror group Abu Sayyaf for conducting the bombing. The Abu Sayyaf has alleged links to Jemaah Islamiyah, the Southeast Asian terror cell of Al-Qaeda.

Mrs. Arroyo called on local village securities to be more vigilant so they can become force multipliers in the war against terror.
