The Ministry of External affairs has revoked the passport of Mr. Harish Kumar Dogra who was removed from his post as India's High Commissioner to New Zealand in April. The government has also suspended the passports of his wife and domestic help. India has informed Wellington of the developments and has said that travel documents would be issued to Dogra and his family to enable them to return home. Sources say Dogra had applied for a New Zealand visa which would have enabled him to stay in that country for another 40 days. Dogra had been posted as High Commissioner two years ago and was recalled after charges of human trafficking were made against him. 
The former High-Commissioner, however, refused to obey the recall order and
accused Foreign Secretary Shyam Saran of impropriety, asking the latter to either prove the charges or resign.
