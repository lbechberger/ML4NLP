A military led group has announced on national television that it has dissolved the government of Guinea and suspended the country's constitution.

The group performing the apparent coup d'etat has called itself the National Council for Democracy.

The coup took place just hours after the death of the Guinean president, Lansana Conte, who died aged 74. The cause of death is currently unknown. 

Before his death, Conte ruled the country as a dictator.

The now suspended constitution states that the president of the country's National Assembly should become the new leader of the country. However, since the constitution has been dissolved, it is unlikely that this will take place.
