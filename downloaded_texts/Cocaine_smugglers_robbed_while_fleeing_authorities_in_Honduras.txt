Cocaine smugglers were themselves robbed of an estimated 1,000 kilos of cocaine yesterday by local criminals while trying to flee Honduran authorities in the remote La Mosquita region of the country. The smugglers were taking the drug by speed boat from Colombia to the United States when they were spotted and pursued by members of the Honduran navy. In order to escape their pursuers, the bandits landed on the beach at Yahurabila and tried to make their way inland. Within minutes, they were held up by a group of local delinquents, who relieved the smugglers of their merchandise. Both the smugglers and the local criminals are still being sought by the Honduran authorities.
