According to a poll taken by Demoscopia and published in the Costa Rican newspaper Al DÃ­a, 53% of respondants say they disapprove of the presidency of Abel Pacheco. This is an increase in 21 points since the last poll taken in August of this year.

Costa Rica is the only Central American country yet to ratify the Central American Free Trade Agreement (or CAFTA). Pacheco has sent the bill to the legislative branch for ratification but they are not expected to approve until April of 2006. CAFTA was supposed to go into effect on January 1, 2006.
