Rescue personnel have found the body of a 46 year-old man, who drowned in Lake Palestine, in northeast Texas, while fishing on Sunday. Rescue crews began searching the lake for a missing person on Sunday evening around 8:30pm (local time). A police official told reporters the man was found just before midnight on Sunday evening. 

The man, identified as Fredrick Perkins, was a resident of the city of Tyler. Perkins was fishing with a woman, when they fell out of their boat. Reports indicate Perkins was not wearing a life vest, although the woman was. She said he fell into the water when attempting to bring in a stringer of fish. 

Onlookers stated it was unclear if the boat overturned or if the man simply fell from the boat. Witnesses reported the boat was about 300 yards from the shore when the man fell into the water. Officials used a sonar device to locate Perkins' body. His remains were found along the bottom of the lake at 11:53pm.
