The Rice University baseball team defeated the University of Oklahoma 10-4 in the first game of the NCAA Super Regional.


Brian Friday and Josh Rodriguez helped push Rice to an early led with consecutive home runs in a four-run first inning.

Wayne Graham, Rice's head coach, said, "Obviously, I'm happy with the way we hit the ball. We attacked the ball real well. When we answered their runs, that was critical. We never got complacent."

Rice (54-10) and Oklahoma (44-21) will meet Sunday for the second game in the series at Rice's Reckling Park. If Oklahoma wins, a third game will be played Monday. If Rice wins, it would send the team to the College World Series for the fifth time, the first since winning the title in 2003.
