The United States Department of the Treasury has frozen the assets of terror suspect Anwar al-Awlaki. He is wanted in Yemen for his alleged participation in the Christmas Day bombing of a Northwest Airlines flight. 

Al-Awlaki was denoted as a "key leader" of al-Qaeda. According to US Treasury Undersecretary Stuart Levey, al-Awlaki "...has sought to encourage his supporters to provide money for terrorist causes."

Al-Awlaki was jailed in 2006 in a Yemen prison for kidnapping for ransom. He was released in 2007 and afterwards went into hiding. 

This move by the Treasury placed al-Awlaki onto a list of Specially Designated Global Terrorists. This freezes his assets, prevents American citizens from sending him money, and disallows him from traveling to the United States.
