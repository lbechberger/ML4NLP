Individuals and organisations around the world announced their support for the environment by turning off lights and electrical appliances between 8 and 9 pm for Earth Hour 2008.

In the city of origin, Sydney, Australia, the end of Earth Hour was celebrated with a fireworks show. Although many cities were not officially covered by Earth Hour, people from regions including Bristol, United Kingdom will turn off their lights for the event. Danish royal palaces went dark at the queen's command. One of these people told Wikinews that "it [Earth Hour] is a very important event as it helps to raise awareness of climate change worldwide."

This is the first time the movement went global. The first Earth Hour, held on March 31, 2007, saw more than 2.2 million residents and 2100 businesses in Sydney, Australia, switch off their lights.
