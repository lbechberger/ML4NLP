Former UK Law Lord Slynn of Hadley, along with 1,300 British lawyers, urged Home Secretary Jack Straw in a press conference at the British House of Lords in London to remove the Mujahedin-e-Khalq (MEK), an Iranian opposition group, from the EU's list of foreign terrorist organizations. 

They voiced their protest in an statement called " A Call for Justice". The statement reads: "â€¦ For detailed reasons, which are beyond the realm of this statement, renowned international legal experts have concluded that there is no legal basis for the proscription of the People's Mojahedin Organisation of Iran - PMOI. Terror tag on the Mujahedin is the by-product of the failed policy of appeasement with the Islamic Republic of Iran. Continuing the MEK proscription is nothing by more concession to the mullahs with serious consequences both for the region and world peace. "

The MEK is militant organisation seeking to overthrow the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran. Apart from the EU, the United States also consider the MEK to be a Foreign Terrorist Organisation.
