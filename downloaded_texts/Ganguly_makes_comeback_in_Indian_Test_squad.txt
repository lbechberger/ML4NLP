The ex-Indian cricket team captain Sourav Ganguly has made a comeback in the Test team after he was unceremoniously dropped for ten months.

Ganguly is expected to play the first test match of the series against South Africa commencing on December 15.

Chairman of selection pane for the Indian team Dilip Vengsarkar said that the team batting had failed in one-dayers in the current series, so there is need to bring back experienced players.

VVS Laxman has been appointed as vice-captain of the test team.

Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) president Sharad Pawar cleared the air over Greg Chappell-MP dispute by saying that "What happened in Parliament should have no bearing on the incidents taking place in Protea land,".

Ganguly last played for the team against Pakistan in a test match in Karachi earlier this year.

The sixteen member-team is as follows:

Rahul Dravid (Captain), VVS Laxman (Vice-captain), Wasim Jaffer, Gautam Gambhir, Virender Sehwag, Sachin Tendulkar, Sourav Ganguly, Mahendra Singh Dhoni (Wicketkeeper), Dinesh Kaarthick, Harbhajan Singh, Anil Kumble, Munaf Patel, Irfan Pathan, VRV Singh, Zaheer Khan and S. Sreesanth.
