On the one year anniversary of Saddam Hussein's capture, 13 Iraqis were killed according to AP in a suicide car bomb attack by an al-Qaida-linked terrorist. The attack took place about 9 AM Monday, when many Iraquis were arriving to work, outside the Green Zone which is home to the Iraqi interim government and several embassies. The region is under severe protection. 

Authorities said the suicide bomber detonated the car while it was in line at a checkpoint. The explosion was very loud and it could be heard throughout the city.
