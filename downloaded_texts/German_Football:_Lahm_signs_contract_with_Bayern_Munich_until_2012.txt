Philipp Lahm has agreed to terms on a three-year extension to his current contract with newly crowned German champions Bayern Munich which will keep him in Munich until June 30, 2012.

"I'm delighted about it, otherwise I wouldn't have done it,“ Lahm commented before of a final pre-match training session today. Talks with the board and incoming coach Jürgen Klinsmann in recent weeks had been "very productive. I sense a real new beginning here, and that's what persuaded me,“ he told the respected Süddeutsche Zeitung.
