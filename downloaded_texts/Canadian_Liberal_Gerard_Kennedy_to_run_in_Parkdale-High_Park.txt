Former federal Liberal leadership contender Gerard Kennedy will run in the next federal election in Parkdale—High Park, the same riding he represented in the provincial legislature until earlier this year. This will be the former Ontario Education minister's first run for a seat in the Canadian House of Commons.

The federal riding was held by fellow Liberal Sarmite Bulte until last year's federal election when she was defeated by New Democrat Peggy Nash. The NDP's Cheri DiNovo also took the provincial riding, formerly held by Kennedy, in a by-election last year. 

Bulte had hoped to try to retake her seat for the Grits but is expected to step aside and allow the Liberal nomination to go to Kennedy. Bulte and Kennedy have announced a press conference to be held on Tuesday to make an "important joint announcement".

Two other former leadership contenders without seats in the House of Commons, Bob Rae and Martha Hall Findlay are also eying Toronto area ridings. Both of them are reported to have hopes of running in the safe Liberal seat of Toronto Centre now held by former interim party leader Bill Graham who is considering retirement. CTV News has reported that Liberal leader Stephane Dion may offer Rae the Liberal nod in the riding of Mississauga—Streetsville currently held by Wajid Khan who sat as a Liberal until he crossed the floor earlier this year to join the Conservatives.
