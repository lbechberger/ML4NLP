Users of Apple Computer's MacBook computers have criticized Apple for failing to include a FireWire port in its newest release of its basic laptop. The users expressed the anger at the popular company with hundreds of messages posted on Apple's official forum, in the minutes after the announcement to remove the FireWire port was made by Steve Jobs.

Russ Tolman was one of the first people to complain about the issue. "I work in a large school district that doesn't like Macs. One thing that has allowed us to keep them has been the ability to image them with firewire ports," he stated. "In my unknowledgeable opinion Apple really screwed up with no Firewire port. Schools without much money will be moving to cheap PC's."

Apple's MacBook Pro computers will continue to have a FireWire port, although cost significantly more than the MacBook.

Apple responded to these criticisms in a statement by saying that "Actually, all of the new HD camcorders of the past few years use USB 2." While camcorders are a popular FireWire peripheral, FireWire is used for a variety of other devices.

Apple's press release did not mention the fact the FireWire was removed from the MacBook, although it did mention that the MacBook Pro has one FireWire port. 

The MacBook Pro costs US$ 1,999, while the standard MacBook costs $1,299.
