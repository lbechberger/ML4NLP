Pakistan's Supreme Court has extended a ban on making, selling and flying kites. The ban, which was imposed on October 25, has been extended until the court meets again on January 26.

Officials claim the ban is due to injuries resulting from people using metal kite strings, and due to deaths resulting from kite flyers falling off rooftops.

Basant, a kite-flying festival, where tens of thousands of people fly kites from rooftops and sports fields, takes place in Lahore, Pakistan every February. Hardline Muslims oppose Basant as wasteful and a Hindu festival.
