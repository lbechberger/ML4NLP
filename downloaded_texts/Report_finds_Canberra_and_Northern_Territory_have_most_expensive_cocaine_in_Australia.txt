In a report released yesterday by the Australian Crime Commission titled "Illicit Drug Data Report 2011–12", the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) and the Northern Territory have the highest price of cocaine found in Australia's states and territories. 1 gram costs AU$500 in the Northern Territory and runs between AU$300 and 500 in the ACT. This compares to AU$450 in Victoria, AU$250 to 400 in New South Wales, AU$300 to AU$400 in Queensland, and AU$350 in Tasmania. 

The Northern Territory also has the highest national prices for 1 gram of amphetamine at AU$400 to 800, and MDMA at AU$30 to 60 for one tablet. Crystal meth goes for 1 gram at a national high of AU$1,000 to 2,000 in the Northern Territory, but Northern Territory ties with Western Australia at AU$100 to 200 for one street deal of 0.1 grams. Northern Territory has a national high price for hydroponic head (non-leaf) cannabis at AU$30 to 100 for one street deal of approximately 1 ounce. Data was not available for the Northern Territory for the powdered form of methamphetamine, with Queensland having the highest price at AU$50 to 150 for one street deal of 0.1 grams, and South Australia having the highest price for 1 gram at AU$700 to 900. 

The report — the commission's tenth annual report of Australian illicit drug data — also notes a ten-year 580% increase in performance and image enhancing drugs detected at the national border by Australian Customs and Border Protection Service officials. Cannabis accounts for a large portion of Australia's illicit drug related activities, accounting for 65.5% of all drug related arrests in 2011–2012, and total seizures at 68.1%. Drugs other than cannabis, amphetamine, cocaine, and opioids such as heroin had the greatest seizures by weight at 56.8%. The total number of drug related arrests in the 2011–2012 is the highest in the past decade with over 90,000 total arrests. It is also the first time the reported total number of drug seizures topped 70,000.
