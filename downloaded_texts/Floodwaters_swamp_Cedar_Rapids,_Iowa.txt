In the United States, the Cedar River continues to break records today as it floods Cedar Rapids, Iowa. The river is approaching its expected crest of over 30 feet, over 18 feet over flood stage and more than ten feet over the previous record high. 

The downtown area is underwater, as well as several residential neighborhoods against the river. 

All road bridges over the river in the area except for the Interstate 380 bridge are closed and covered with water, and one of the two railroad bridges has swept away. For a short time, the Linn County Sheriff's Department had closed I-380 to allow emergency services to use it, but later re-opened it, allowing traffic in the rightmost lane.

The river is expected to crest around 7:00 a.m. Friday morning (June 13).
