According to police, at least three civilians were killed and three others injured by a car bomb in the Republic of Dagestan in Russia.

Reports say the blast occurred outside the Karavan Cafe in Khasavyurt and only killed those inside the cafe.

An unconfirmed report says one of the injured died while receiving medical treatment.

There are nearly daily attacks in Dagestan from Islamic militants, wanting to form an Islamic state. The militants usually target police and other security officials.

Militants from Dagestan are suspected in an attack earlier this week at the Domodedovo airport in Moscow, killing at least 35 and injuring 110.
