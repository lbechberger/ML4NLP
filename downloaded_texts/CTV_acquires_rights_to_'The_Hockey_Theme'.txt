The CTV Television Network has acquired the rights to The Hockey Theme. Composed by Dolores Claman, The Hockey Theme was the theme song of Hockey Night in Canada, one of the most popular Canadian television programs, since 1968.

The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's (CBC) latest license to broadcast The Hockey Theme had expired at the conclusion of the latest NHL season. On June 6, negotiations between Claman and CBC broke down, with the CBC announcing that a deal could not be reached. The CBC offered to resume negotiation with a mediator today. However, by mid-afternoon today, Claman's representatives announced that they had sold the rights to CTV.

CTV will use this song in its broadcasts of National Hockey League (NHL) games on The Sports Network (TSN) and RÃ©seau des sports (RDS), as well as during the 2010 Winter Olympics.
