A Polish soldier was killed yesterday by a roadside bomb in eastern Afghanistan. Sgt. Kazimierz Kasprzak was killed in the province of Ghazni when a roadside bomb exploded underneath the patrol vehicle in which he was travelling. His death was announced by the Polish Defence Ministry and Lt. Sebastian Kostecki, a spokesman for the Polish military.

Kasprzak was airlifted to a military base after the explosion but died during surgery. He was 32 years old. With his death the toll of Polish forces killed in Afghanistan has risen to 21. Polish forces joined NATO in their fight with the Taliban in March 2002.

President of Poland Bronislaw Komorowski has said he has planned to pull Polish troops out of Afghanistan by 2012. Many Polish citizens favor pulling troops out of the war zone. Poland has around 2,600 troops currently in Afghanistan.
