A security camera at the First Judicial District courthouse in Santa Fe, New Mexico has captured an unidentified star shaped object that appears to spin, on camera. The object was recorded on Friday and some say it is a ghost, a reflection, or a piece of cottonwood fluff.

Alfred Arana, a Sheriff Deputy for Santa Fe County first discovered the object after he began to watch the surveillance recordings from the day before. He then requested Sgt. Vanessa Pacheco watch the recording to see what she thought. The object appeared at the time stamp of just before 7:30 a.m. (pacific time) on Friday morning.

"Generally, most people who’ve seen (the video) believe it is some type of spirit or ghost. It's something unexplainable, (but) I don't believe in ghosts so I don't think that's what it is," said Sgt. Pacheco.

Public defender Earl Rhoads who works at the courthouse says that the object is totally explainable and that it is likely a piece of fluff from the cottonwood trees that stand close to the camera.

"I'm not willing to say it's proof of paranormal activity. I think it's totally explainable. I’m open to other possibilities, but my best guess at this point is that it’s a small floating object near the camera lens, probably a fluff of cotton from the cottonwoods nearby or an insect or something like that," said Rhoads.

In the video, the object moves from the back door of the courthouse (in the upper right corner of the screen). It then floats, while rotating, shining and appearing in the shape of a star, toward the bottom right corner of the screen, past a police car, and then out of view.
