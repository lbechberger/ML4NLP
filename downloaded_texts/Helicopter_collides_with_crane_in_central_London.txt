A helicopter hit a crane on the top of a high-rise building, St George Wharf Tower, in Vauxhall, Central London today, killing the pilot, Pete Barnes, and another person not in the helicopter. At least nine people were injured and at least five of them were delivered to hospital.

After the collision, debris from the lightweight, twin-engine Augusta 109 fell on the road.

The incident occurred during the morning rush hour, in heavy fog. Full investigation may take up to several months, but authorities already have said the incident does not suggest terrorism.

Barnes had extensive piloting experience and used to work in film industry, including some work in the James Bond film series.
