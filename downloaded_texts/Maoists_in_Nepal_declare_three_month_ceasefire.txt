Maoist rebels in Nepal announced a three-month ceasefire from Thursday onward saying that this move reflected their support for the formation of a new Constituent Assembly. Maoist leader Prachanda said in a statement that the People's Liberation Army would not carry out any offensive military action during the tenure of the ceasefire. Maoist rebels have been fighting to overthrow the monarchy in the Himalayan nation since 1996 and over 13000 people have been killed in the insurgency. The Maoists' announcement has been welcomed by India, which has indicated that it will likely resume sending financial and military aid to Nepal.
