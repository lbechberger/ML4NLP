MTV's 2005 Video Music Awards were rather unbalanced this year, with Green Day's capture of seven of the eight awards for which they were nominated. The awards were for their single "Boulevard of Broken Dreams" off of the American Idiot album. Up-and-coming rock bands Fall Out Boy and The Killers also won awards. Kelly Clarkson came out with two awards.

The event was hosted by Sean "Diddy" Combs at the American Airlines Arena in Miami, Florida, USA, which was unaffected by the passing of Hurricane Katrina through the area or by the shooting of rap producer "Suge" Knight.

Some notable events was Combs "conducting" a string orchestra in memory of slain rapper Notorious B.I.G while his song played, fellow rapper Snoop Dogg came out to sing the last verse of B.I.G's hit song "Warning".

Green Day arrived at the event in their rusted green convertible from the Holiday and Boulevard of Broken Dreams music videos. They kicked off the show with a performance of Boulevard of Broken Dreams.

R. Kelly performed a new segment to his soap opera song "Trapped In The Closet". Kelly remains a chart-topper even though the star is awaiting trial for child pornography charges.
 
Marion "Suge" Knight was shot in the leg at a private party, hosted by Kanye West, at the Shore Club Saturday night, one day before the main event. He was taken to nearby Mount Sinai Hospital where he was treated for the non-lethal gunshot wound.
