During his trial today, Muslim cleric Abu Hamza al-Masri, denied the claim that he had incited his followers to commit acts of murder. Instead he claimed that he had asked them to fight abroad. The charges against Abu Hamza include nine counts of soliciting to murder and three of trying to stir up racial hatred. He denies all 15 charges against him.

When questioned by his defense council he was asked if he had incited followers to kill in England. To this Abu Hamza replied "No". Abu Hamza also told the court of his feelings about racism "If you are a scholar you will never distinguish between anyone of any color. Racism is one of the greatest sins. I actually condemned it,"

The cleric also denies that he was in possession of a document which could be considered to help in the preparation of terrorist attacks.

The defense barrister warned the jury to ignore the comments of the press as they may have convicted the defendant before the trial has begun. Comments such as "Captain Hook" and "Hook off Hooky" have been used. Mr. Fitzgerald told them of "exaggeration and misrepresentation by the media".

The cleric faces nine charges under the Offences against the Person Act 1861, plus four charges under the Public Order Act 1986 of "using threatening, abusive or insulting words or 
behavior with the intention of stirring up racial hatred". The possession of video and audio recordings with the intent to be used to stir-up racial hatred, and a final charge of the possession of the Encyclopedia of the Afghani Jihad, which, is said to have information "of a kind likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism".
