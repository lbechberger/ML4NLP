Releasing a video on her website, Hillary Clinton announced today that she will be forming a presidential exploratory committee.

"I'm in. And I'm in to win", the Democrat Senator for New York announced on her website today, confirming the widely held assumption that she will seek the U.S. presidency in 2008. This is widely speculated to be in immediate response to senator Barack Obama's presidential exploratory committee announcement earlier this week.
