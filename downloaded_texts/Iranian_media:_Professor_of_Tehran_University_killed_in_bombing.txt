A remote controlled bomb attached to a motorcycle killed a Tehran University nuclear physics professor, Massoud Ali Mohammadi, near his home in the Iranian capital.

According to state run IRIB's website, "Ali-Mohammadi, a nuclear scientist and a committed and revolutionary Tehran University professor, was detonated by a remote control."

"As a result of the bomb planted by Zionist (Israeli) and American agents two cars and a motorcycle were severely damaged and the windows in the surrounding residential units were shattered," stated IRIB.

"Iranâ€™s police and security bodies are investigating the terrorist case to identify those behind it," Press TV reported on Tuseday. 

Press TV added that while no one had been arrested yet, a "handprint of Israeli intelligence services" was suspected in the event.

Mehdi Mohammadifar, a senior official in the Interior Ministry, said the reason for the bombing was being investigated.
