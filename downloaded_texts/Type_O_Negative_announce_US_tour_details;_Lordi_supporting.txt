American Gothic doom metal band Type O Negative have announced details of their upcoming tour of the United States.

The supporting act for the entire tour is confirmed to be Lordi, a Finnish melodic hard rock band known for their monster costumes and lyrical themes. The tour is spread across fifteen dates, and is in support of Type O Negative's new album, Dead Again. The album is the band's seventh, and reached number seven on the Billboard 200 and No. 2 on the magazine's Top Independent Album's chart.

"Spacing the records far apart is how you achieve diverse results," said a statement by keyboardist Josh Silver. "When you're forced to write an album every year or eight months, you haven't changed - you're still the same asshole you were eight months ago. We've been different assholes every record. We've retained our identity through all the changes."
