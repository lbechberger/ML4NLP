Prince Harry, third in line to be the monarch of the United Kingdom, has been photographed dressed as a Nazi.

Harry, aged 20, was attending a fancy dress party last weekend when a fellow party-goer photographed him wearing a swastika armband and Nazi insignia on the lapels of his shirt. The photographs were published today by The Sun, a British tabloid. 

After the picture was published, Clarence House (the official residence of Prince Harry) published the following statement: "Prince Harry has apologised for any offence or embarrassment he has caused. He realizes it was a poor choice of costume." Prince Harry himself has made no comments.
