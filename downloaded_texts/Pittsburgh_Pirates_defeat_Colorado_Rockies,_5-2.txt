In Monday night Major League Baseball action, the Pittsburgh Pirates won a victory over the Colorado Rockies in Denver, 5-2. The Pirates up 3-1 by the 6th inning and strong pitching throughout helped hold off the Rockies.

Ian Snell pitched 6 1/3 innings for the Pirates, and recorded a career and season high 10 strikeouts, giving up only 2 runs, 6 hits, and a single walk. In the first three innings, Snell threw 29 of 35 pitches for strikes. The win was his 6th of the season. Snell's previous career high in strikeouts was nine, set May 3 against the New York Mets.

Coming off a 7-3 homestand, the Pirates hoped to turn around their dismal 4-22 road record, and break a 4-game road losing streak. A strong appearance in their first game of the 3-game series will ease many doubts.
