Following an historic meeting between Ian Paisley and Gerry Adams, the leaders of the DUP and Sinn Fein respectively, devolved government is to return to Northern Ireland. A delay has been agreed by those involved and a new target date of the 8th of May has been set for the restoration of power sharing in Northern Ireland. 

The governments of Britain and Ireland had warned that the Stormont assembly would be shut down if an executive had not been agreed by today.
