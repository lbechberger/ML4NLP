Unconfirmed reports from Iraq say that Abu Hamza al-Muhajir, the supposed successor of al-Zarqawi, has been killed in a US-led military raid. However, the US military has so far denied this.

According to the US, Abu Hamza Al-Muhajir replaced al-Zarqawi, the previous leader of al-Qaeda in Iraq, after he was killed in a US raid in June 2006.
