The New Zealand soccer team, the All Whites, was beaten 4-0 during a friendly match against Brazil in Geneva on Monday morning NZST. 

New Zealand goalkeeper Glen Moss put in a good effort to keep the scoreline down by producing a string of saves, but Ronaldo, Adriano, Kaka, and Juniniho all managed to put the ball past him to score for Brazil.

New Zealand looked comfortable early on and Moss even managed to save a one-on-one with Brazilian skipper Cafu. However it was Brazil who went into the half-time break 1-0 up courtesy of Ronaldo's goal in the 43rd minute.

Brazil then stepped it up in the second half and New Zealand was forced to spend long spells defending.

Adriano put the ball through the legs of Moss in the 51st minute to put Brazil further ahead, and Kaka and Juninho then sealed Brazil's win with one goal each in the last minutes of the match.

For Brazil, the match was a warm-up for the 2006 FIFA World Cup in Germany, which begins on June 9, with the hosts playing Costa Rica in Munich. Brazil's first match is on June 13, against Croatia in Berlin.
