Tropical Cyclone Monica has missed Darwin, dissipating into a category one cyclone at 1030 AEST (0030 UTC). The cyclone was originally expected to hit Darwin as a category five, but lost power as it traveled across the Northern Territory, moving further south than anticipated. While this may bring relief to many residents fearing a return of the infamous Cyclone Tracy, authorities have warned that Monica still packs a punch and will bring 90 kph winds to the region. Northern Territory police commander, Bert Hofer, has advised residents to "stay where they are," for the time being. Australian airline Qantas is resuming its flights to Darwin as of 1945 AEST today. All ANZAC Day dawn services were cancelled in the Northern Territory's capital.
