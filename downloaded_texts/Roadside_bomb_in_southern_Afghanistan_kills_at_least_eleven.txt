Local government officials have said that at least eleven people were killed on Sunday in southern Afghanistan by a roadside bomb.

The governor's spokesman, Daud Ahmadi, said to media that "a civilian car struck a roadside bomb in Nawzad district." According to the spokesman, a family was riding on a tractor with a truck-bed hitched on back, when it hit the explosives on a central road; all of the people aboard died, including two children and two women.

Ahmadi blamed the attack on the Taleban.

The incident comes several weeks after soldiers from the US, NATO, and Afghanistan, initiated an offensive against the Taleban in Helmand's Marjah and Nad Ali areas on February 13.
