24-year-old Dutchman Pieter Weening takes out the eighth stage of the Tour de France to Gérardmer by millimetres over German Andreas Klöden. 

Weening joined a breakaway just as the route crossed the border to return to France after starting the day in Germany. Weening was caught by Klöden just before he reached the summit of the Col de la Schlucht with 15 km to the finish. 

Weening and Klöden worked together to hold off the 30 strong pack by 27 seconds. Weening sat in Klöden's slipstream as they approached the line, and pulled out at the last moment to pip the German on the line by millimetres.
