West Australian Police have begun a review of cold cases in their state following Bradley John Murdoch's conviction for the murder of British backpacker Peter Falconio.

Police believe that Murdoch from Broome, in northern Western Australia, could be responsible for the Claremont serial killings in Perth during 1996 and 1997. Police have also indicated that they will be exploring the possibility that Murdoch had been responsible for the disappearance of Hayley Dodd, 17 from Badgingarra and the disappearance of a woman from Broome in 1996.

Police will examine the details of the Falconio trial to construct a timeline of Murdoch's whereabouts. Police Sargeant Graham Clifford said "Murdoch's methodology and criminal profile were being scrutinised".
