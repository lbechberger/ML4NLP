Former Massachusetts Governor and Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney won the 2012 Nevada caucuses yesterday. This win follows his win in Florida's primary earlier in the week. Former U.S. Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich came in second and Ron Paul and Rick Santorum followed.

With 71% of districts reporting, Romney won with 48% of the vote, followed by Gingrich with 23%, Paul with 19%, and Santorum with 11%. Nevada has 28 delegates, which will be distributed proportionally.

According to an entrance poll preformed by CBS News, Romney won 48% of the male vote and 52% of the female vote. Romney also won 56% of the vote among people with postgraduate educations. Newt Gingrich won 32% of the vote from people who make less the US$30,000 a year, while Paul won 31%, Romney won 29% and Santorum won 8%.

At his victory celebration, Romney told supporters "This is not the first time you gave me your vote of confidence and this time Iâ€™m going to take it to the White House". Romney had also won Nevada in the 2008 caucuses.

Newt Gingrich pegged his strategy on the coming primaries. He also said that "I don't think a timid approach [by Romney] will beat Barack Obama in the fall... I'm going to run a campaign of big ideas, big solutions."
