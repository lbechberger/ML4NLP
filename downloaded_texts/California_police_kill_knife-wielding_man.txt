A Long Beach, California man was shot today by Long Beach police. Police allege that the man lunged at police who returned fire and killed the man.

Two police officers are reported to have been attending another call in the area when they noticed a man bleeding from his head and wielding a knife. The man did not listen to police orders to drop down and unsuccessfully tried to subdue him with a Taser stun gun. As the man lunged at the officers with a knife, both fired several rounds at him, killing him.
