A man has been admitted to hospital, having been seriously injured when hit by a car in Glasgow, Scotland. The accident took place at approximately 0345 UTC on Sunday morning. The 30-year-old victim was run over by a Vauxhall car in the vicinity of John Knox Street and Wishart Street in the east end of the city.

The pedestrian was transferred to the Southern General Hospital after initially being transported to Glasgow Royal Infirmary. The condition of the passenger, who experienced a serious head injury, was described as serious albeit stable by hospital staff. The 48-year-old driver, who alerted emergency services to the incident, was uninjured but apparently shaken.

Sergeant Jo McPherson of Police Scotland said of the area in which the accident occurred: "Despite it being in the early hours of the morning this route can often be busy with taxis and cars as people make their way out of the city centre." Appealing to potential witnesses for information, Sergeant McPherson said: "The area is also overlooked by residential flats and it's possible someone may have witnessed the crash from their flat."
