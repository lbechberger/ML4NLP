The former Argentine soccer player Diego Armando Maradona, aged 44, was honored with the keys to the Colombian city of Cartagena. 

Maradona is in Cartagena recovering from stomach surgery he had to reduce the size of his waist. The surgury was necessary because Maradona is suffering of severe obesity problems which may put his life at risk. He is 5 foot 6 inches (1.67 meters) tall and weighs 267 pounds (121 kg). 

The Argentine was grateful for the homage and showed good humour:
"I want to thank the mayor for giving me the keys to the city. Even though I do not have the keys to my own house, I have a key to the people, like those of Cartagena, and it fills me with pride." 

He added: "I offer my thanks in my own name, in the name of my two daughters and that of my whole family. Thank you Cartagena and thank you Colombia."
