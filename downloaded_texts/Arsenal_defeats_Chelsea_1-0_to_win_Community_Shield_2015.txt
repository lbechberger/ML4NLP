On Sunday, London-based football club Arsenal, winners of the 2015 FA Cup, defeated 2015 Premier League Champions Chelsea 1–0 in the 2015 Community Shield trophy which was played in the Wembley Stadium.

The match saw only two yellow cards, to one player from each club in the second half. Though Arsenal had lesser possession of the ball and fewer shots, they had more shots on target. A total of 23 fouls were committed. 

It took fourteen attempts for The Gunners to win a game over the city rivals. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain scored the only goal of the match, for Arsenal in the 24th minute. Belgian goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois could not save this left-footed shot in the top corner which gave Arsenal a lead. In the 80th minute, Chelsea won a free kick. Eden Hazard's kick was denied by ex-Chelsea Petr Čech, who recently signed for Arsenal and this was his debut for Arsenal.

This was Arsène Wenger's first victory over the Portuguese Chelsea manager José Mourinho. Wenger did not even shake hands with Mourinho after the victory. This is back-to-back Community Shields for Arsenal. They defeated Manchester City in the previous final.

"We were the best team", said Mourinho in remarks to BT Sport. "We had more initiative, we controlled the game by having ball possession. Arsenal defended with 10 players, they put everybody in front of their own line and they had good organisation, congratulations to them."
