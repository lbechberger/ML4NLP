United States rap star Nate Dogg has died at the age of 41. The cause of death was reported by his attorney as complications from two strokes that Nate Dogg, whose real name is Nathaniel Dwayne Hale, had suffered in the past few years. During his career, Hale collaborated with several big names including Eminem, Dr Dre, and Ludacris.

Rapper and actor Snoop Dogg who went to school with Hale paid tribute to his friend on Twitter, "We lost a true legend n hip hop n rnb.

Hale started his rap career in the early 1990s, and formed rap trio 213 with Snoop Dogg and Warren G in 1991. After collaborating with several of rap's big names including the late Tupac Shakur, Hale went on to release three of his own albums. In December 2007, he was left paralyzed down one side of his body after a stroke. He suffered a second stroke in September 2008.
