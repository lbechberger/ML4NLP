The S&amp;P/TSX Composite Index dropped 2.7%, falling 364 points eventually ending the day at 13,040. Despite this 'dramatic' drop, the main Toronto index is still above where it was eight weeks prior at the end of 2006. 



Recently, the TSX set seven record highs in nine trading sessions. Its benchmark index doubled since October 2002 as well as experienced a steady rise in commodity prices.
