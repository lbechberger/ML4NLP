Frank de Jong, 51, leader of the Green Party of Ontario is running in the Ontario by-election for Burlington, Ontario. He registered Wednesday night, the deadline for people wanting to run as a candidate, at the returning office.

Previously, Cam Jackson was the MPP for Burlington. But, he resigned to run for mayor of Burlington in the Ontario 2006 municipal elections. Jackson won on November 13, 2006. After, the riding was vacant for months and that's when the by-election was finally called.

De Jong is up against Progressive Conservative Joyce Savoline, Ontario Liberal Party and former Burlington city counciler Joan Lougheed, and New Democrat Cory Judson.

A couple of Burlington residents were also interested in running in the by-election, according to chief financial officer for the new riding association, Lawson Hunter.

De Jong has been leader of the Green Party of Ontario since 1993.
