The Buffalo Sabres have beat the Ottawa Senators in a score of 3 to 2 in game four of the Stanley Cup playoffs. 

Just 9 seconds into the first period, Derek Roy scored the first goal to give Buffalo the lead of 1 to 0, making Sabres-franchise history as the fastest goal to start a playoff game.

In the second period, Maxim Afinogenov and Chris Drury of the Sabres both scored goals to bring the Sabres lead 3 to 0.

Also in the second period, Dean McAmmond and Peter Schaefer of the Senators scored two goals to bring the Senators down by one at 3 to 2.

No goals were scored in the third period, with the Sabres winning the game. Ryan Miller, the goalie for the Sabres stopped 31 of the 33 Senators shots on goals.

"When things weren't going our way at the end of the second period, we could've packed it in there. You know it's too tough. But we battled through some tough situations," said Miller to reporters after the game.

"They were trying their hardest to give it to us, but their goalie decided that he didn't want to let anything by him," said defense man Joe Corvo of the Senators.

The Sabres are hoping that this begins the comeback after their 3-0 deficit, a feat only achieved by three North American sports teams, the 1942 Toronto Maple Leafs, the 1975 New York Islanders, and the 2004 Boston Red Sox.

Game 5 of the playoffs will be held at HSBC Arena in Buffalo on Saturday, returning Home Ice advantage to the Sabres.
