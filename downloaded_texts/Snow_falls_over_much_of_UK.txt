Snow fell over much of the United Kingdom overnight, with many roads being closed as a result of this. The M56 has been closed in both directions.

The city of Bristol was subject to its heaviest snow in over a year. BBC News has reported that up to 3 inches of snow will fall in parts of Southern England. Major cities including London were hit by the snow.

A Wikinews reporter noticed at approximately 10:00 local time (09:00 UTC) that there appeared to be no significant effect on the traffic as a result of the snow. It is probable that this is because the majority of the snow had either been cleared or melted.

The snow continued to fall until mid morning in most off the South of England, however melted away in the afternoon. In Liverpool, North West England and Bristol occasional snow flurries occurred through to the early afternoon, this continued in Liverpool through the afternoon to early evening.
