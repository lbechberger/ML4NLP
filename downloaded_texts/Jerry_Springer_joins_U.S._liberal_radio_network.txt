Television star Jerry Springer has signed a contract to join the year-old political network Air America Radio Network starting April 1. He says the new deal will not affect his popular television program, which will continue to be produced. 

After initially being carried by only 45 stations nationwide, the host of the long-running syndicated program, The Jerry Springer Show will eventually have his radio show heard on all 51 Air America affiliates. The show also is planned to be broadcast by the Sirius and XM satellite radio services. 

Springer said he is committed to making his radio show a success. "Progressive, populist voices need to be a part of our nation's dialogue," Springer said in a press release. "I hope I can make a contribution." 

Although best-known for his low-budget, tongue-in-cheek talk show, Springer does have a political pedigree. He was a Democrat mayor of Cincinnati in 1977 and made a failed bid for governor of Ohio in 1982.
