Series even at 1-1. (Best of Seven)





The Pittsburgh Penguins won their first playoff game since 2001, as they defeated the Ottawa Senators, Saturday afternoon. Sidney Crosby scored the game-winning goal midway through the third period, when he redirected a pass from teammate Mark Recchi into the net behind Ottawa goaltender Ray Emery. The Senators weren't pleased with the goaltending of Ray Emery, who despite only facing 21 shots, allowed four goals. Penguins netminder Marc-Andre Fleury, however, was spectacular at times, denying 34 of 37 Senators' shots, including a game-saving stop of Mike Fisher from the slot with 13.3 seconds remaining in regulation. The Penguins acquired Gary Roberts from the Florida Panthers for playoff experience, and that is what he gave the team today, scoring the game-tying goal in the third, and adding an assist. The Penguins and Senators are now tied in the best-of-seven series, with one game apiece.

Ryan Whitney gave the Pens the early lead when he scored his first goal of the postseason at 3:01, during a power play opportunity. Ottawa would rally to take a 2-1 lead in the second, with Jason Spezza and captain Daniel Alfredsson each receiving credit for goals. Pittsburgh would storm back to tie the game in the third, when Gary Roberts picked up his first postseason goal with the Penguins at 2:04. Ottawa would answer with a goal to retain the lead one last time. The Penguins rookie phenom Jordan Staal scored his second goal in as many games at 9:34. With the game tied at three goals apiece, Sidney Crosby, the youngest Art Ross trophy winner in NHL history would step up. Evgeni Malkin passed the puck to Mark Recchi, who would in turn move the puck up to Crosby where he would bury it behind the Senators' Ray Emery.
