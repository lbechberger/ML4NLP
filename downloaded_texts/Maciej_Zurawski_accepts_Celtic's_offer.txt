Forward Maciej Żurawski, one of the most famous Polish footballers, accepted a contract offer from Celtic yesterday. He is now waiting for agreement between Celtic and his former club, Wisla Krakow, where he played for nearly 6 years.

Wisła wants to receive a lump sum payment at once, but Celtic would like to pay circa 3 millions euro in installments.

Żurawski, the star of Polish national football team, rejected an offer from Trabzonspor. The Turks had offered approximately 100 thousand euro more for him. If he had accepted this offer, he would play alongside former Wisła's player, Mirosław Szymkowiak.

Many people, including former Celtic star Dariusz Wdowczyk, believe he made the right decision. He will play for a club with a long history of international presence, and with chances of appearing in the Champions League this year, something Żurawski's expressed as his dream.

Celtic will be Żurawski's fourth club in his career. He has played for Warta Poznan, Lech Poznan, and for Wisla. He will earn over €700 thousands per year.
