American actress Jessica Alba, 26, has announced her engagement to producer, and father of their unborn child, Cash Warren.

The pair met on the set of the movie The Fantastic Four, where Warren was a directors assistant. They have been together since 2004, although they did briefly split at one point.

Alba made the announcement via her publicist, Brad Cafarelli, who said "I can confirm they are engaged." She had only announced her pregnancy earlier this month, and the child is expected in spring or summer next year.

As well as Fantastic Four, Alba has starred in Dark Angel, Sin City, Good Luck Chuck, The Ten and Awake.
