Pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly and Company is currently engaged in a war of words with John Mack, editor of the monthly newsletter Pharma Marketing News. Mack and Eli Lilly are debating the origin of the Cialis Blog, a long-running Web site containing information about the popular anti-impotence medication Cialis. The Web site features information about Cialis' clinical trials and commentary from Lilly ICOS executives. 

Mack has suggested that Eli Lilly and Company sponsors the Cialis Blog. However, Lilly ICOS has asserted that it has nothing to do with the Web site. 

Mack disputed Eli Lilly's version of events calling the Cialis Blog "too far-fetched to be believed" and an example of Lilly's "incredible incompetence." Another blog, Envisioning 2.0, notes that the "Cialis blog is not endorsed by the powers that be at Lilly ICOS, according to Lilly spokesperson Kindra Strupp." 

Pharmaceutical Executive first mentioned the Cialis blog in an October 2004 article about pharmaceutical blogging. The author of the story assigned responsibility for the blog to Lilly ICOS without attribution. 

Other bloggers have posted comments on Envisioning 2.0 and Mack's Pharma Marketing Blog suggesting that the Cialis Web site may be unofficial. They cite evidence from a WHOIS search indicating that Mircea Piturca of Romania apparently registered the blog. 

Mack and bloggers commenting on the debate have all urged Eli Lilly to take action against the site. They all believe it is in the companyâ€™s best interest to have the site shuttered.
