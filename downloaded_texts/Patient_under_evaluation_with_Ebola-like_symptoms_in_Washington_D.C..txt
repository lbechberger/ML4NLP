A patient was admitted to a hospital in Washington, D.C. after showing Ebola-like symptoms, according to a statement yesterday by hospital spokeswoman Kerry-Ann Hamilton.


Hamilton confirmed Howard University Hospital admitted the patient in stable condition. The patient had been to Nigeria, where some cases of the Ebola virus have occurred. The hospital has followed protocol for infection control, including separating the patient from others to prevent possible infection of others.

The director of the D.C. Department of Health said they have collaborated to monitor patients with Ebola-like symptoms with Howard University Hospital and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Shady Grove Adventist Hospital in Rockville, Maryland admitted another patient with Ebola-like symptoms, but health officials there yesterday night later determined this person had malaria, not the Ebola virus.

At the peak of Ebola countermeasures in Nigeria, almost 900 people there were monitored for the virus after contacting someone who was already sick.
