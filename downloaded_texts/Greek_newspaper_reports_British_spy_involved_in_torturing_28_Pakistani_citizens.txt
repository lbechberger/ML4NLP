The Greek newspaper Proto Thema is reporting a member of the British embassy staff in Athens, Nicholas Langman, was involved in the abduction, interrogation and torture of 28 Pakistani-born immigrants to Greece. The alleged victims were detained in connection with the 7 July bombings in London.

The disclosure of British MI6 agents acting openly in Greece has precipitated an uproar in the Vouli ton Ellinon, with the opposition uniformly calling for the matter to be discussed in the parliament.

"Such a thing never happened, does not happen and won't happen," said Giorgos Voulgarakis, the Greek Minister of Public Order, in early December when the detainees went public with their charges. Jack Straw, British Foreign Minister, has likewise denied the charges.
