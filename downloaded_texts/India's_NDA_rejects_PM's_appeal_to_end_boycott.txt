The National Democratic Alliance (NDA), the chief alliance of Opposition Parties in India, has rejected Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's appeal to end its boycott of Parliament. A spokesperson of the Bharatiya Janata Party, the chief opposition party, Sushma Swaraj termed the appeal as a "mere formality" which was akin to "rubbing salt to the wound". 

"I appeal to leaders of the opposition to join the proceedings and this government is ready to discuss all issues and there is no issue which is barred from discussion," Singh said in parliament.

The NDA has been boycotting Parliament to put pressure on the government to answer their demands for the dismissal of Lalu Prasad Yadav, Railways Minister. Yadav had been indicted over charges stemming from the "fodder scam".

The appeal comes as the Telugu Desam Party, an ally (although not a member) of the NDA, while maintaining its criticism of the Government's attitude, decided to end its boycott of Parliament and will join for the rest of the Budget Session.
