Reports published by various political news websites on Wednesday night said that there may be a movement within the Libertarian Party to replace its vice presidential nominee, Wayne Allyn Root.

This comes after Libertarian National Committee (LNC) representative Stuart Flood made a motion to remove Root from the ballot over remarks that the latter made in a recent interview with Reason Magazine. Many found these remarks to be racially insensitive.

It is reported that Libertarian presidential nominee and former congressman Bob Barr wants Root off of the ballot as well, which some believe is the reason that the Barr campaign supposedly advised party Chairman Bill Redpath to keep Angela Keaton, a probable vote for Rootâ€™s removal, on the LNC. Over the past few weeks, several members of the LNC have been trying to remove Keaton from the committee because of what they felt were sexually inappropriate comments written by her in a blog.

Barr has been the subject of controversy for over a week because of his last-minute refusal to attend former Republican presidential hopeful Congressman Ron Paul's third party unity conference at the National Press Club in Washington, DC last Wednesday.
