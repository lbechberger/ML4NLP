According to an AP report, United States Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton (D-NY) stated during the inaugural of the Aspen Ideas Festival, "I sometimes feel that Alfred E. Neuman is in charge in Washington." The event was organized by the Aspen Institute, a think tank unaffiliated with any particular political party.

She claimed that Bush's attitudes towards many major issues are in line with the Mad magazine character's philosophical catch line: "What, me worry?" Republican groups denounced the comment, saying that Sen. Clinton was merely making a partisan attack for political gain at a time when the nation should be focusing on national security issues. Republican National Committee spokeswoman Tracey Schmitt called Senator Clinton "part of today's angry and adrift Democrat Party."

Many have speculated that the former first lady and current New York senator will make a presidential bid in the 2008 election, but the Associated Press related Sen. Clinton's words as that she is "too wrapped up in her Senate work and re-election effort to think about that."
