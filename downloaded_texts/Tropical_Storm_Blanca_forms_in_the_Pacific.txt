The United States National Hurricane Center has upgraded a tropical disturbance off the coast of Mexico to Tropical Storm Blanca. The storm is the second named storm of the 2009 Pacific hurricane season. 

The storm currently has maximum sustained winds of 45 miles per hour. Blanca is located about 390 miles south-southwest of Baja California, Mexico, and is currently tracking towards the west-northwest at 10 miles per hour. 

The storm is expected to continue moving away from land over the next few days. Current projections show that it could intensify slightly before entering unfavorable conditions and weakening.

Blanca is not expected to directly impact land, but interests in the area are encouraged to track its progress.
