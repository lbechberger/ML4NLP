A suicide bombing near an airfield in Kandahar, Afghanistan earlier today has killed at least three people and injured a further 35, according to reports.

According to a commander of southern Afghan armed forces, Sher Mohammed Zazai, the explosion hit the airfield as well as a compound giving logistical help to NATO troops.

A correspondent for Al Jazeera in Kabul reports at least three suicide bombers were involved in the attack. The news agency also attributed the attack to the Taleban.

This attack comes soon after the United Nations said it would be closing its Kandahar office temporarily due to concerns about security. At least twenty civilians, among them eight children, have been killed in attacks in Kandahar since April 12.
