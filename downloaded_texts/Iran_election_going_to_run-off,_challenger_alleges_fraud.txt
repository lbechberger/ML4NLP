Friday's elections whittled Iran's field of presidential candidates from eight to two, but the incredibly close vote has led to the scheduling of an unprecedented runoff to be held next Friday.

Candidates Mahmoud Ahmadizezhad and Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani will square off next week --- unless candidate Mehdi Karroubi has his way. Karroubi has alleged voting irregularities and has called on Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei to investigate. Karroubi alleges that members of the unelected Guardian Council and the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps conspired to rig votes. These charges were seconded late Saturday by reformist candidate Mostafa Moin, who had been leading in some pre-election polls but placed third in Friday's vote.
