On July 5, 2009, Michael Jackson's 2005 compilation album The Essential went to number 1 in the UK Album Chart, following a sudden rise in his record sales after his death. 

Finally, after a seven week run at the top of the album chart, the compilation, which contains a selection of Michael Jackson's hits, finally fell five places to number 6. The album now at number 1 is Calvin Harris's Ready for the Weekend. The album contains a selection of tracks, such as "I'm Not Alone" and "Ready for the Weekend". Harris hopes to get to number 1 in the UK Singles Chart with the latter.

Calvin Harris also managed to beat rapper Tinchy Stryder's album in the sales battle, with Catch 22 only getting to number 2.
