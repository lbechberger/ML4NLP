Two mass graves discovered in Lebanon near a former Syrian intelligence center in Anjar have reopened the investigations for persons missing from the Lebanese civil war (1975 â€“ 1990).

Lebanese officials have announced DNA samples of the remains found will be tested.

Troops unearthed at least 30 bodies buried in the 1980s and 1990s.

Syrian troops withdrew from Lebanon last spring, ending a 30-year occupation. Prior to his assassination, Gebran Tueni commented that "the Syrian regime has been exposed with the discovery of the mass graves."

Amnesty International has been critical of the exhumation, calling for UN standards of investigation.
