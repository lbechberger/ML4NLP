The third Test between Australia and India commenced on Wednesday at the WACA in Perth. 

India won the toss, and Indian captain Anil Kumble elected to bat. India quickly made a half century in nine overs. Shortly after, the first wicket fell with Virender Sehwag caught behind by Adam Gilchrist for 29 runs. About half an hour before lunch with three more overs, the next wicket fell when Gilchrist also caught Wasim Jaffer. 

India were 2/74 at lunch, and played well during the afternoon, losing no wickets. Rahul Dravid was dropped on 11 runs by Michael Clarke, and went on to share a partnership of 139 runs with Sachin Tendulkar as India reached 2/177 at tea. 

In the last session India put on 120 runs, losing four wickets, including two just before stumps. Brett Lee trapped lbw Tendulkar (71), while Sourav Ganguly fell for just nine runs soon afterwards. Dravid reached 93 runs before being caught by Ricky Ponting, and V. V. S. Laxman was dismissed for 27 runs shortly before the close of play. India finished the day on 6/297.

Brett Lee was the leading wicket taker, tallying 3 wickets.

Australia lead the four match Test series 2-0, after a controversial second Test prompting India to threaten to pull out of the tour.
