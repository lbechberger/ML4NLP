Condoleezza Rice, U.S. Secretary of State, said for the first time that the United States would not attack North Korea. Rice rejected a suggestion that Pyongyang may feel it needs nuclear weapons to defend itself against an Iraq-style U.S. invasion.

North Korea said today that; "If the U.S. keeps pestering us and increases pressure, we will regard it as a declaration of war and will take a series of physical corresponding measures."
