American heavy metal/shock rock band W.A.S.P. have announced a world tour to mark the 15th anniversary of the release of concept album 'The Crimson Idol'.

The tour will start at the end of October and carry through to early 2008. So far, 49 dates have been announced, although W.A.S.P. have not announced the venues for all of them, and more dates are to be announced later.

Said the band in a statement: "For the first time ever, 'The Crimson Idol' [album] will be performed in its entirety live. Never before has this great work been attempted to be performed this way. The live performance will feature all of the music from the original album but in addition, never-seen video footage will be shown throughout the show from beginning to end. This filmed footage was shot in 1992 and was originally designed to be a full-length movie. 

"To commemorate the 15-year anniversary of this milestone album, it will be presented in its original story form. This promises to be a powerful and moving live experience. Being done in selective dates worldwide in 2007-2008."
