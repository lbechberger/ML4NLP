Fabio Capello has emerged as the new favourite to succeed Steve McClaren as the England football team's new head coach after JosÃ© Mourinho ruled himself out of taking the job. 

The former Chelsea manager had been widely regarded as a favourite for the job but after he admitted yesterday that he is no longer interested in it, Capello became the new favourite.

The Italian, who has previously managed Real Madrid, AC Milan, Juventus and Roma, would regard the England job as the highlight of his career according to sources close to him and is ready to open talks.

Other candidates for the job include fellow Italian Marcello Lippi, former Germany coach Jurgen Klinsmann and Aston Villa manager Martin O'Neill.
