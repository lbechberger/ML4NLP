The Arctic Monkeys and BjÃ¶rk have been confirmed by the organisers of Glastonbury Festival to be the headliners at the 2007 event.

Mr Eavis and co-organiser Emily Eavis told the BBC in an interview that the "biggest band in the world" had also contacted them about performing but denied that it was U2 or Coldplay . He also added that "most of the line-up's now done" but it won't be released until after 1 April, the first date for ticket sales.

The full line-up release date has not been set but Emily Eavis told the BBC website that it was "in the coming months"

The application process for tickets has also been tightened with applicants having to first fill out a form online and supplying a photo. Then "the first 150,000 people that come through (on the hotline) will be booked in" on the 1 April. This process is all part of an attempt to stop ticket touts cashing in on the sell-out event.
