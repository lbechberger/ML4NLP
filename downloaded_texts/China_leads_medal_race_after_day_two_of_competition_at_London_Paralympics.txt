London, England — Following the second full day of competition at the 2012 Summer Paralympics, China leads the medal race with 13 gold medals and 34 medals in total. Australia comes second with 7 gold, and the Ukraine is third with 6 gold medals.

China's large medal haul was distributed across several sports, with 15 from swimming, 5 each from athletics and track cycling, 4 from judo, 3 from powerlifting, 2 from shooting.

Australia's first medal of the Games was won in women's standing air rifle shooting event where Natalie Smith captured a bronze medal during the first medal event of the Games. One of Australia's bronze medals came in athletics' F35–36 shot put event. Kath Proudfoot originally was listed as finishing fifth, but the Australians appealed this citing errors in how her results were calculated. Their appeal was successful, and Proudfoot came away with her second consecutive Paralympic medal in the event.

Over half the medals won by the United States came in swimming, with 7 total. The country has earned an additional 3 in track cycling and 1 in athletics.

A number of competitors have already earned multiple medals, including Australia's Jacqueline Freney and Matthew Cowdrey, and the United States's Jessica Long and Elizabeth Stone who all picked up a pair of medals in the pool.
