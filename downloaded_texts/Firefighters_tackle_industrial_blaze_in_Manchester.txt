Over fifty firefighters are damping down after a tanker exploded at an industrial unit in Salford in Greater Manchester. At one point, thick smoke could be seen drifting across Manchester city centre. 

According to Greater Manchester Ambulance Service, no one has been hurt as a result of the explosion. 

A fire service spokesman said a Heavy Goods Vehicle and a nearby building were engulfed in flames. 

Greater Manchester Police are telling people to stay away from the Pendleton area. A spokesman said: "Officers are currently at the scene along with several fire engines including an aerial appliance. The fire has caused a large plume of smoke to form but at this stage it has not been established whether it is hazardous. It appears the fire has caused a number of small explosions within the building. As a precaution people are asked to stay away from the immediate area and those living in the immediate vicinity are being advised to stay indoors and keep all windows and doors shut as a precaution. There are no reports of any injuries."
