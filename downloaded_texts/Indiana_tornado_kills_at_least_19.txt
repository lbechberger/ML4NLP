A tornado with winds up to 300 km/h has killed at least 19 in Indiana and Kentucky. The tornado touched down at around 2.00 AM local time on the 6th of November in northern Kentucky and then crossed the Ohio River into southern Indiana near Evansville, Indiana where the majority of casualties were reported. "At least five people were confirmed dead in Warrick County and at least 18 were killed in Vanderburgh County, according to county officials."

Peak storm season for the region is generally April through June - a storm of this ferocity is quite rare at this time of year, according to the National Storm Prediction Centre.

The death toll varies between sources, but between 19 and 23 is the current estimate, with most of those in Indiana.
