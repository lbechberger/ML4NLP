Reports say that Burmese military generals have signed the release papers of pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi; her release has not been officially confirmed. Rumours spread that Suu Kyi would be freed yesterday, but she is now expected to be freed today when her arrest period expires.

Security has been increased, though it is unclear whether it is in anticipation of Suu Kyi's release. Benjamin Zawacki, Amnesty International's Myanmar specialist, says that the release will only take place if the national ruler Senior General Than Shwe believes it's in his advantage. "I don't anticipate they will release her without conditions," Zawacki added.

Suu Kyi's lawyer had earlier said that she would only accept an unconditional release. He added that there was no law to continue the arrest after Saturday. She has been held under house arrest numerous times in the last 20 years. In 1991, a year after her National League for Democracy won the Burmese general election, she was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. But her win in those elections were nullified by the military junta.
