Actor John Barrowman escaped serious injury in a 80mph crash while filming a segment for TV show Fifth Gear in Powys, Wales. One of the show's presenters, Tiff Needell, was in the passenger seat at the time of the accident.

Barrowman, whose character in the BBC series Torchwood is unable to die, lost control of the Subaru before plunging down an embankment. The car flipped four times before coming to a rest, narrowly avoiding landing in a lake.

Paramedics at the scene managed to pull the two stars out of the car, having to remove glass from Barrowman's eye and later taking him to hospital.

Three years ago, Richard Hammond, presenter of rival show Top Gear, was involved in a 288mph crash while filming a piece for the show.
