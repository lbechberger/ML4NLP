FIFA has begun disciplinary proceedings against Marco Materazzi after Zinedine Zidane was sent off for headbutting Materazzi in the chest. Zidane has said he reacted to provocation.

Both players have been summoned to attend a hearing of its disciplinary committee on Thursday 20 July and a decision is expected later that day.

FIFA said: "The decision was taken following claims made by Zinedine Zidane, who attacked Materazzi with a headbutt during the final."

Zidane has the right to make a written statement, which must be submitted by Tuesday 18 July.

Materazzi will then be given a copy of the statement so he can respond.
