Today, American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) Local 12 marked the 101st anniversary of International Women’s Day. Wikinews was there for the celebration.


International Women’s Day has been observed globally for more than a century to honor the achievements of women.


Local 12, the union representing the employees of the U.S. Department of Labor, marked the day by serving coffee and donuts to employees and presenting flowers to female employees. Attached to each flower was a note saying: "Celebrating 101 years of International Women’s Day and Acknowledging your Worth and Contribution to the World."

International Women’s Day has been celebrated by many countries for over 100 years and some have even designated it as a national holiday. The "Triangle Fire" in New York on March 25, 1911, brought attention to working conditions and labor laws that became the focus of subsequent International Women’s Day events.

Thousands of events are held around the world and at the United Nations to inspire women to celebrate their achievements. Giving flowers to women on Women's Day is a tradition in many countries.
