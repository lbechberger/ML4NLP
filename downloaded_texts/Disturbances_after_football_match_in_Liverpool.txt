Thirty fans were arrested and five officers were injured Saturday night in Liverpool following Manchester United's 2-0 win at Everton in an FA Cup match up.

Officers in riot gear were called out to the Everton Valley section of the city to separate the rival fans of the teams. It is believed that Ill-feeling marking Wayne Rooney's return to Goodison Park erupted outside the ground into what Merseyside Police called "large-scale disturbances". Officers were hit by rock, bottles, and other projectiles, several needed to be taken to area hospitals for treatment of their injuries.

During the match, a missile from the crowd struck United keeper Roy Carroll. Everton have vowed to ban for life the fan who threw the projectile, believed to be a coin, which injured Carroll. Police also reported recovering a mobile phone which was thrown onto the pitch during the game.
