Paraguay beat Trinidad and Tobago in a match that had no effect on the qualifiers through to the round sixteen of the Fifa World Cup, Tuesday.



Paraguay edged the game from start to finish and got a goal in each half.

Trinidad and Tobago could manage just two shots to trouble Aldo Bobadilla in the Paraguay net. Kelvin Jack, who started his first Fifa World Cup game, made seven saves.

After 25 minutes Jack was a bystander when Roberto Acuna's freekick was driven hard into the box. Jack's central defender Brent Sancho inadvertently directed the ball goalbound with his head.

The goal that sealed the game for the South Amercians was scored six minutes from time by Nelson Cuevas after he had exchanged passes with Roque Santa Cruz.
 
The game was notable for being the last appearance for Carlos Gamarra, 35, for his national side. He had played 110 games for Paraguay.

After three games the Group B table was topped by England with seven points and then Sweden with five points with Paraguay and Trinidad and Tobago going out of the competition.
