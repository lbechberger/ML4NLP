London, England â€” The final day of rowing at the London Paralympics took place yesterday at Eton Dorney, with all the medals being decided. China finished on top, earning two golds. Ukraine came in second in rowing medals with a gold and a bronze, Great Britain earned a gold, France earned a pair of silver medals, Australia and Germany won a silver medal, and Belarus and Russia each won a bronze.

Coming into the AS Men Single Sculls, Tom Aggar of Great Britain was the gold medal favourite having not lost a major international competition. He failed in his quest. Australia's Erik Horrie claimed silver in the event despite being in the hospital 24 hours earlier. With a close finish, Australia's fans initially thought he won bronze.

The TA Mixed Double Sculls race was a fight for bronze with Gavin Bellis and Kathryn Ross of Australia being just beaten by Oksana Masters and Rob Jones of the United States by less than a second to finish fifth.

Sebastian Coe, Prince Edward, the Duchess of Cambridge Kate Middleton and Australia's Minister for Sport Kate Lundy were amongst the dignitaries that watched the medal races.
