A recently created Danish clothing company is selling on the internet T-shirts in order to support the clandestine radio station of the Colombian guerrilla group Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) and the graphical workshop of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP). In fact the money will be used by these groups to carry on their terrorist activities. FARC activities include kidnappings, masacres, bombs, extortions and the drug trade.

Fighters and Lovers is selling the T-shirts at 170 DKK (US$27.6), from which 35 DKK (US$5.7) are to be destinated to support both armed groups.

Anna Duever, Fighters and Lovers PR chief, said to Spanish news agency EFE that their objective is to "defend freedom and social justice, which is FARC and PFLP are fighting for". Duever believes the fact the FARC has been included by the EU in its terrorist group list is a "political game". "We pay our taxes in Denmark, and that money is used for financing the troops our government has sent to Iraq. That's terrorism. Besides, in Colombia there's a regime oppressing population and torturing and killing its people", she said.

Colombian Foreign Affairs Minister, Carolina Barco, said to local media that "financing terrorist groups is unacceptable and goes against all the international norms. Yesterday [Tuesday 19] our ambassador contacted the Danish government, we sent a protest note and have demanded an explanation." 

A year ago, a Danish NGO named OprÃ¸r ("Rebelion") stated it had donated money to the Colombian guerrilla. A new antiterrorism law in Denmark may punish it.
