Just like a Hitchcock horror movie, birds are on the offensive in downtown Houston. According to the Associated Press, large black grackles are attacking people on a stretch of sidewalk in the city. It is thought that the birds may be trying to protect their young.

The sidewalk, which is in front of the County Administration Building, has been closed off by the authorities.

In 1960 Hitchcock based The Birds starring Tippi Hedren on a Daphne du Maurier short story from the early 20th century. Although the locations are different, the main focus of both works is birds that attack people.

"I hit him with a bottle," said Sylvia Velasquez. "The other birds came, and one attacked my blouse and on my back."
