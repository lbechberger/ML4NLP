Both Georgia and Japan have qualifed for the 2007 Rugby World Cup in France next October and November. The World Cup pools are now starting to take their final shape, with just two repechage positions remaining. 86 nations have attempted to qualify for next years' tournament.

Georgia drew 11-all Portugal in the final leg of the last series of European qualification, however in the previous match, Georgia were victorious, thus on points, Georgia go through to France. Georgia join Pool D, where they will face Argentina, hosts France, Ireland and Namibia. Georgia have previously qualified for one other World Cup, the 2003 tournament in Australia. Despite Portugal's loss, their hopes to qualify are still very much alive, though they now face Morocco for the right to then face Uruguay to take out one of the two repechage spots in the World Cup.

Japan defeated Korea 54 points to nil, this coming after their win over Hong Kong earlier in the week. Japan go through to Pool B, where they join Australia, Canada, Fiji and Wales. Japan have qualified for every World Cup since the first tournament in 1987. Korea (who have yet to debut at the Rugby World Cup) can also still qualify, as they will now play Tonga for the second repechage position.
