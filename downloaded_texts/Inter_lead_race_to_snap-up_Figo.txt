Internazionale are understood to be on the brink of snapping up Real Madrid star, Luis Figo and are also thought to be leading the race to sign him.

According to the Italian newspapwer Gazzetta dello Sport, the 32-year-old Portuguese right-side midfielder, who has been a Liverpool F.C transfer target for quite some time, is close to agreeing a deal with Inter.

Reports in Spain, however, suggest Figo will finally resolve his dispute with the Madrid giants when he returns from the club's pre-season tour of Japan later this week, clearing the way for a move to Merseyside. 
 
Liverpool F.C. manager Rafael Benitez has also revealed that he will buy a right-sided midfielder before the start of the new Premiership campaign. 
 
"We are waiting for news, we have heard nothing as yet," he said. "We are in Lithuania and he is flying from Japan so maybe we will hear something later in the week." 
 
Figo has been in dispute with Real over the payment of the final year of his contract. 
 
Liverpool are likely to offer Figo wages of around £60,000 a week, if he does sign, but Inter are also stepping up by stating that they would give him around €3.5 Million Euros a year.
