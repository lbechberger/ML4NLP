Tropical Storm Danielle, fourth named storm of the 2010 Atlantic hurricane season, has formed in the eastern Atlantic Ocean. The storm, located approximately 3,000 miles from Miami, Florida, has maximum sustained winds of 40 mph (64 kph). Scientists at the National Hurricane Center predict that Danielle will strengthen to a hurricane by Wednesday. 
As the storm is far from landfall, it remains difficult to assess potential impact to the United States or Caribbean.

The storm formed near the Cape Verde Islands off the coast of West Africa, being classified as Tropical Depression Six. It then developed into a more organized cyclone moving eastward. Forecast models show it will stay on an eastward track, later turning to the Northeast. If the models are correct, Danielle will avoid any landfall across the Eastern United States.

Meteorologists predict that Danielle will be the first of several storms to form within the next two weeks, as the Atlantic Hurricane season is currently at its peak. "There are signs that the Atlantic is acting like it should in August and September. We're seeing more activity than we did earlier in the season," said Rick Knabb of the Weather Channel.

Even though the 2010 season seems to be one with low activity, emergency officials are still stressing safety and awareness to residents in hurricane-prone areas. "It only takes one storm to cause a loss of lives and devastating property damage. Hurricane Andrew was a catastrophic Category 5 storm that came during a year when it was a lower-than-average season.
