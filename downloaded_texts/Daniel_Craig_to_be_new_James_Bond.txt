British actor Daniel Craig has been confirmed as the man to follow Pierce Brosnan as the sixth James Bond.

Producer Barbara Broccoli and director Martin Campbell called Craig 'a superb actor who has all the qualities needed to bring a contemporary edge to the role'.

"It is a huge iconic figure in movie history, and those things don't come along very often," Craig said. The role makes Craig the second Englishman to act as the British spy code-named 007, based on the famed literary character created by novelist Ian Fleming in 1953.

Craig's film credits include Road to Perdition, Enduring Love, Layer Cake and Sylvia. On British television, his major breakthrough was a starring role in the 1996 BBC drama Our Friends in the North.

The next Bond film Casino Royale is due to film in Italy, the Bahamas, the Czech Republic and Pinewood Studios. The film is due for release in 2006.
