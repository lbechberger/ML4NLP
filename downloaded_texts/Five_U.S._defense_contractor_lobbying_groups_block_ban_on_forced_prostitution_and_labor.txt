The Chicago Tribune is reporting that five U.S. defense contractor lobbying groups have held back on passing legislation that would ban contractors from involvement in human trafficking for forced prostitution and labor. The congressional mandate was a response to a variety of abuses around the world including labor conditions imposed upon some Iraqis working with contractors in Iraq and a sex slave ring operated by Dyncorp employees during the Bosnian conflict in the 90's.

Congress ordered the Pentagon to implement regulations barring such practices two years ago; and the Pentagon drafted the necessary regulations in the summer of 2005. However, defense contractors such as DynCorp and Halliburton's KBR claim that key portions of the defense department's proposal are unrealistic.
