According to the United States Geological Survey (USGS) a major magnitude 7.3 earthquake has struck 131 kilometers (82 miles) southwest of Macquarie Island, an Australian holding located to the south of New Zealand.

The quake struck at 11:30 a.m. local time and had a depth of 10 k.m. (6.2 miles).

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) states that there is no threat of a large tsunami, but that small local waves may be generated close to the quake's epicenter.

The NOAA further said that, "Authorities can assume the danger has passed if no tsunami waves are observed near the epicenter within an hour of the earthquake."

So far, there is no word on injuries or damage.
