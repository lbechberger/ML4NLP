After 1,581 consecutive days (just shy of 4 years and 4 months), David Witthoft of Connecticut has stopped wearing his #4 Brett Favre jersey.

The Ridgefield, Connecticut boy, 12, wore the No. 4 jersey every day after receiving it as a gift for Christmas in 2003. David's father, Chuck, said Monday that his son's last day wearing the jersey was April 23--his 12th birthday.

Witthoft conceded his son was starting to become more concerned about his appearance after the jersey barely came down to his belt line. In 2007, Witthoft said he "would keep wearing it as long as [he] could get it over [his] head." His mother, Carolyn, had washed the jersey every other day and mended it when needed.

Witthoft first gained national attention three years ago and attended his first Green Bay Packers game in December 2007 (a 34-13 Packers victory over the Detroit Lions). He's also planning to attend the September 8 game when the Packers retire Favre's No. 4 against the Chicago Bears on Monday Night Football.

Witthoft has considered sending the jersey to the Green Bay Packers Hall of Fame.
