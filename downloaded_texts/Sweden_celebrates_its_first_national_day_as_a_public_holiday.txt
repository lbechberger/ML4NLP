Sweden today celebrates its first national day as a public holiday.

At 10 o'clock (CET) the day was officially opened by the Royal family children at the Stockholm Palace. Crown Princess Victoria said that it was a very special day.

During the day, several demonstrations are scheduled in Stockholm and the rest of Sweden.

June 6 is celebrated in the remembrance of the crowning of Gustav Vasa in 1523. The Gustav Vasa-reference is a somewhat criticized in parts of Sweden that weren't a part of Sweden back then.

Since 1983 it's a National day, but it has been an ordinary weekday until 2005. Thus, the Swedes haven't celebrated their National day much at all, compared to e.g. the Norwegians.
