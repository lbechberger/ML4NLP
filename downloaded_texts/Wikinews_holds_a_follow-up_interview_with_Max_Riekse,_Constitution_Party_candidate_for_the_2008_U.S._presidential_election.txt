In March, Wikinews held an exclusive interview with Max Riekse, one of the candidates for the Constitution Party nomination for the 2008 United States presidential election. With the Constitution Party's national convention underway this weekend, we spoke with him one last time before he either becomes his party's candidate or loses.

Riekse is a retired decorated Lieutenant Colonel in the U.S. Army who served in both the Vietnam War and the Iraq War. He is also a former public school teacher and Assistant Professor of Military Science at Western Michigan University. He has a B.A. in Political Science and International Relations from the University of South Florida as well as two M.A.s, one in Political Science and International Relations, the other in Education and History. Both are from Western Michigan University.

We asked him if he thinks he has a good shot at winning the Constitution Party nomination and ultimately the presidency. He replied, "I will know Saturday the 26th if I win the nomination of the Constitution Party. As to wining the general election, I'm very sure that I will do far better then we have done in the previous 20 years as a 'third' party. I'm not only more qualified to be commander in chief then either the Democrat or Republican, but will be far better for the country."

When asked about America's illegal immigration problem he replied, "I will send all 20 to 30 million home. End birth right babies; no social security for them, etc. They are here illegally; now what part of that does anyone not understand?"

Riekse is running for president because "the Republicans and Democrats would not be having candidates that would solve the problems we have in this country and I know that I could do a lot better with my 32 years of military experience and over 20 years in Education, both in the K-12 public school venue and teaching at the University level."
