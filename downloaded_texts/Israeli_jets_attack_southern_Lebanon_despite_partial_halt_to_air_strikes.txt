Israeli jets have carried out strikes in southern Lebanon, despite agreeing to halt air attacks for 48 hours. An army spokesman has confirmed the action saying that the plane was intended to support ground troops in the area and was not targeting anything specific.

Meanwhile Israeli Defense Minister Amir Peretz addressed parliament saying that an immediate cease was not planned and that military action in Lebanon would continue.

He said "It's forbidden to agree to an immediate cease-fire, Israel will expand and strengthen its activities against the Hezbollah."
