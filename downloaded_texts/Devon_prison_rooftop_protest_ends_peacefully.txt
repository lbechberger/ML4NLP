A rooftop protest at a Devon (UK) jail has ended peacefully after almost 28 hours.

The protest, involving 10 inmates, at HMP Channings Wood started after prisoners complained their meals were being prepared by sex offenders. 

The category C training prison in Newton Abbot, Devon presently holds 663 inmates, with units dedicated to sex offenders and drug offenders.

A Home Office spokesman said: "The rooftop protest at HMP Channings Wood has ended peacefully with no injuries to prisoners or prison staff." 

The Prison Service has so far refused to confirm the extent of the damage done during the protest, but it is believed to run into thousands of pounds with glass being smashed and paving slabs being torn up.

Earlier on Monday afternoon three prisoners had already given up their protest, leaving ten remaining on the roof. They eventually came down at around 6:30 p.m. BST after speaking with trained negotiators.

The Prison Service has launched an internal enquiry into the protest.
