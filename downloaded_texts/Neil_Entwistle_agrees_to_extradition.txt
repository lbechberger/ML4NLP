Neil Entwistle, 27, appeared before a Magistrates' court today and agreed to extradition to the United States, where he will face double-murder and weapons charges. Entwistle is now the prime suspect in the killings of his wife Rachel, 27, and nine-month-old baby daughter Lillian. Both were shot to death and left under a pile of blankets in the bedroom of their Hopkinton, Massachusetts home. 

District Judge Anthony Evans said in court, to Entwistle, "You are agreeing to be sent immediately to the US and there will be no extradition proceedings?" Entwistle replied, "that’s right, yes."

Ben Brandon, Entwistles council, said "Neil believes he will receive a fair and proper hearing in the US on these very serious allegations," and wishes to go back to the U.S. "as soon as possible. He is anxious that any delay could cause his late wife’s family, and his own, additional distress."

Earlier on Thursday, Entwistle had said before the court, that he did not agree to extradition "at this stage."

However; Entwistles lawyer said that "he never changed his mind. He was always inclined to consent to extradition. He was going to think about it overnight with our advice. And overnight, after reserving his position, he has consented."

Entwistle was reportedly planning a murder-suicide. Instead, police believe he fled to England, where he was subsequently arrested in London.

If convicted of first-degree murder, Entwistle could face life in prison.
