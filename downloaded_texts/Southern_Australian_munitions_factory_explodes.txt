An Australian munitions factory exploded in South Australia. Two people were killed, another two were injured and one is still missing. 

The factory produced explosives for quarrying, civil engineering and the military. 

The explosion leveled everything within 100 metres and could be heard from 70km away. 

Emergency services have been held back to a one kilometre radius of the factory until an explosives expert from Adelaide could come. 

“It's very dangerous, so we're holding back,” police inspector Phil Warwick said, “It's an explosives factory. All right it's exploded, but that doesn't mean all the explosives have gone. There's still smoke coming from the area, which means there must be fire or heat. Put them (remaining explosives and fire) together and we could have another (explosion).”
