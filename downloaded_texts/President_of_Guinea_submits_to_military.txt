Today, the Guinean President Lansana ContÃ© gave into military demands to remove his Minister of Defence, which was a main demand in the three day old military revolt in the African nation. The President also raised the pay of soldiers.

The revolt began when it was leaked that no promotions would occur for Officers unless they had 14 years of service. When this had been announced, junior officers began revolting and making demands of higher pay and the removal of the Minister of Defence, amongst other things.
