After several months in beta, Opera 8 for Windows and Linux was released yesterday. The Opera browser is considered by many to be fast, small and standards-compliant.

HÃ¥kon Wium Lie, the CTO of Opera Software said "The vast majority of Internet users have had to deal with a slow and insecure browser for too long. People are spending more time online, and with the increase in online fraud it is vital that they have a browser that is fast, secure and easy to use. That's what we offer with Opera 8." He described Opera 8 as a "major leap in browser innovation".

This version included many new features including a new unique security feature, advanced page-resizing, tabbed browsing, and pop up blocking. Among the new features for Opera 8 is the support for voice; Opera can be both voice controlled and act as a screen reader.

A spyware-free, ad-supported version of Opera 8 is available free of charge. A small banner or text ad appears at the top of the screen. A version of Opera without ads is available for US$39 or US$20 for students.
