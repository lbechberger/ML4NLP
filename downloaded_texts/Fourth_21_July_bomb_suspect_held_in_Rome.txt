According to three news wires, the fourth London bombing suspect — just named as Hussain Osman — has been arrested by Italian police in Rome.

The arrest has been confirmed by the Italian Minister of the Interior. Hussein is a UK citizen who was born in Somalia, and later moved to Britain and naturalized. 

It comes as two bombing suspects were arrested today in West London, and one in Birmingham on 27 July.
