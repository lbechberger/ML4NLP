The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization has asked countries neighbouring Turkey, specifically mentioning Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Iraq, Iran, and Syria, to be cautious and take measures to prevent the avian flu, H5N1, from spreading. The UN also warned that civilians in these countries should be given more information about the disease. 

Two people have died in Turkey so far, possibly a third, and more hospitalized, after contracting the flu virus. All 15 confirmed cases in Turkey had close contact with birds. As of now, the H5N1 virus strain does not pass easily to humans and does not spread at all between humans.
