Ebner Anivel Rivera-Paz, A leader of the vicious Mara Salvatruchas(MS-13) gang, has issued orders from his prison cell for his followers to teach the American "Minutemen" volunteers a lesson when they begin patrolling the Mexican border tomorrow. 
 
MS-13 gang members are considered to be America's most violent gang with such acts of barbarism as to "cut off the testicles of their enemies and feed them to their vicious dogs" and "cut the heads off their opponents to play soccer with them". However, such allegations of brutality doesn't seem to frighten the "Minutemen" who are a group of Americans who are organizing more than 1,000 volunteers to patrol the Arizona-Mexico border beginning April 1st. They have been called vigilantes by Presidents Bush and Fox and sometimes sarcastically refer to themselves as "undocumented border patrol agents". James Gilchrist, a Vietnam veteran and spokesman for the minutemen in response to the MS-13 threat; "We're not worried because half of our recruits are retired trained combat soldiers..they(MS-13) are just a bunch of punks."

MS-13 gang now has about 20,000 members nationwide and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), has begun to focus on the gang with an initiative they call "Operation Community Shield". The very existence of MS-13 is considered by the Conservative Voice to be a direct consequence of the USA government's 1980's policies in Central America; "the chickens are coming home to roost.Its(MS-13) members are the sons of immigrants from El Salvador and other Central American countries that were forced to flee because of the CIA instigated war during the Reagan Administration that completely destroyed the physical, economic, social, religious and cultural infrastructure of the region. MS-13 was founded in Los Angeles by the offspring of the immigrants for protection."
