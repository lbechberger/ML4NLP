The British Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) has said people are being sold into the sex trade in auctions held at British airports.

Nazir Afzal, the CPS director, says British airports are becoming crime hotspots and "We are now seeing 'slave auctions' being held in public places at airports where brothel keepers are bidding for women destined for prostitution."



The people being traded are said to include those of Eastern European origin. Airports mentioned included Britain's "big three": Gatwick, Heathrow and Stansted.

Tim Brain, the Gloucestershire chief constable in charge of an investigation called "Operation Pentameter," said there might be hundreds of foreign slaves living in Britain.

A world-scale criminal activity, police have said men or women who have visited brothels where they suspect people have been coerced into prostitution should contact the authorities in confidence.

The scandal in which British airports have become key crossing points in slave markets is expected to be discussed more fully at a CPS conference on Monday.
