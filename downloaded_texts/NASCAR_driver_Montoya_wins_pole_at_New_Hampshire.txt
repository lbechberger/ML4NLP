NASCAR Sprint Cup Series driver Juan Montoya won his first pole position of the season on Friday at New Hampshire Motor Speedway. His time of 28.781 was faster than all others who qualified. Kasey Kahne followed in the second position with a time of 28.820, ahead of Kurt Busch and Mark Martin in third and fourth. Two drivers did not qualify quickly enough; they were Travis Kvapil and Mike Bliss.



Montoya said, "It was a good lap until Turn 3, when I got sideways, still in the gas, and I thought, 'They're going to kill me.' I was about to press the button [on the radio] and say, 'Sorry, guys, I got loose,' and they go, 'Oh, good job!" Montoya is currently in twentieth in the point standings, a long shot to make the Chase for the Sprint Cup. He made the Chase last year, but the 2010 season has not been going well for him. "We have more top-10s, more top-fives, and we have much faster race cars than we had last year at this point," Montoya said. 

The race will be held at 13:00 EDT on June 27, 2010. The race will be broadcast on the Turner Network Television in the United States. It will also be broadcast on the radio station Performance Racing Network at 12:00 EDT.
