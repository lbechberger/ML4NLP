2007 Informonth (IT Month), the annual exhibition for IT &amp; 3C industries every winter in Taiwan, started in Taipei on December 1st and will run until December 9th in the Taipei World Trade Center (TWTC). Government officials, such as President of the Republic of China Shui-bian Chen, Premier of the Republic of China Chun-hsiung Chang, Commissioner of Council for Cultural Affairs Chin-chu Weng, Minister of Economic Affairs Steve Ruey-long Chen, Minister of Education Cheng-sheng Du, and Minister of Overseas Compatriot Affairs Commission Fu-mei Chang participated and visited this show to support the IT industry in Taiwan.

Due to several conflicts between political factions, the Pan-Green and Pan-Blue Coalitions, Taipei Computer Association, the organizer of IT Month, changed their plan to hold the Opening Ceremony at the second floor of the TWTC.

Not only did President Shui-bian Chen praise the progression of the IT and Networking industries in Taiwan, but Chun-hsiung Chang also replied to some comments on "Looking Down Taiwan" by a candidate of 2008 Taiwan Presidential Elections Ying-jeou Ma and confidently said, "Since the IT Month can showcase the achievements on the IT and Networking industry, why can Ma deliberately vilify those industries for his votes?" And before the executives left the TWTC, Cheng-sheng Du answered, "Obey the laws" to the media as they asked about the recent issue of "Gate of Great Centrality and Perfect Uprightness".

It wasn't just politicians that attended, however. The Research, Development and Evaluation Commission, Ministry of Economic Affairs, Council of Agriculture, Ministry of Education, Environmental Protection Administration, Ministry of Transportation and Communications, Taipei City Government, National Science Council, National Palace Museum, and National Taiwan University Hospital all participated in the show to showcase their industry solutions and milestones of IT and networking industries.
