BELLEVILLE, Indiana â€” A man wanted in a Pennsylvania double homicide and apparent abduction of 14-year-old girl was captured Monday after a red Jetta he was driving crashed in Indiana following a police pursuit, State Police said. 

State Police 1st Sgt. Dave Bursten said David Ludwig, 18, was apprehended about 12:30 p.m. EST (1730 UTC) after a car he was driving crashed about 20 miles west of Indianapolis, in Belleville. Bursten first attempted to pull Ludwig over, but he sped off, initiating a pursuit by State Police.

Authorities believe that Ludwig was attempting to cross into Minnesota and possibly stay with his relatives, according to information provided by Ludwig's father.

Bursten said Ludwig was found with the missing girl, 14-year-old Kara Beth Borden, a daughter of the slain couple, and that she was unharmed.

"He's in custody and we have the girl," Bursten said.

A radio broadcast heard by a motorist prompted the listener to report sighting the car in which the two were riding.
