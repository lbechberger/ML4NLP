Vandals have caused thousands of British pounds worth of damage at a city railway station. The Bath Spa railway station in Bath was targeted by vandals over the weekend. Graffiti was sprayed over the new tourist centre as well as the stone work which is over 100 years old. The disabled toilets were also vandalised.

First Great Western who owns Bath Spa station released a statement through spokesman Dan Panes saying, "last year we invested a considerable amount of money improving the station environment at Bath Spa for our customers, and it's a great shame that a couple of minutes of vandalism could cause so much damage." 

The vandalism comes just months after a mini police station was opened up in the station to combat anti-social behaviour. The behaviour in Bath was said to be worse than that of the centre of Liverpool. 

CCTV has been passed on to the British Transport Police and are currently assessing the damage caused.
