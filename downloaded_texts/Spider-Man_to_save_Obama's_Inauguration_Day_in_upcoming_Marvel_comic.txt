Marvel Comics announced Thursday that an upcoming issue of a Spider-Man comic will feature United States President-elect Barack Obama meeting the web-slinging superhero.

A six-page tongue-in-cheek story, to appear in The Amazing Spider-Man issue 583, "Spidey Meets the President!" is created by Zeb Wells, Todd Nauck and Frank D'Armata. The issue features Peter Parker visiting Washington, D.C., on photo assignment to cover the Presidential and Vice Presidential inauguration ceremony. The Chameleon is also in town, hoping to sabotage the ceremony with a look-a-like impostor of Obama. Parker's alter-ego Spiderman must save the day from his arch-enemy's nefarious plans.

The issue will appear on newsstands January 14, before the actual inauguration.

Among the lines of dialog in the issue are "Ya hear that, Chameleon? The president-elect here just appointed me ... secretary of shuttin' you up."

The issue will have a commemorative cover, and retail for US$3.99 (Â£2.65). Alan Giroux, owner of All About Books and Comics in Phoenix, says he predicts the issue to be on the collectors' market for $20 by the first day. "This issue will have a lot of heat and go for premium prices. I already have people calling about it," he said.

The issue's cover will feature Obama smiling, with a thumbs up pose. Spiderman is featured hanging upside-down beside him, whispering: "Hey, if you get to be on my cover, can I be on the dollar bill?"

The issue is not official merchandise of the US Democratic Party, Obama campaign, the Obama-Biden Transition Project, or White House.
