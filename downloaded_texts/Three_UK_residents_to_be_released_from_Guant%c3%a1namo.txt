United Kingdom foreign secretary David Miliband confirmed today that three British residents, who are being held at the detention camp at Guantanamo Bay Naval Base, will be released by the United States.

The three are Jamil el-Banna, of Jordan; Omar Deghayes, of Libya; and Abdennour Sameur, of Algeria. They will return "as soon as the practical arrangements can be made," said Miliband.

"Their immigration status will be reviewed following their return, and the same security considerations will apply to them as would apply to any other foreign national in this country. As always, all appropriate steps will be taken to protect national security," the foreign secretary continued.

Miliband said the UK government will work toward getting the US government to close the Guantanamo Bay prison.
