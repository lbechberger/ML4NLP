Hurricane Dean hit the coast of Mexico's mainland today as a Category 2 hurricane, with winds sustained at 100 mph.

Dean moved across the Bay of Campeche, eyeing over 100 oil platforms and several oil ports in the center of the country's oil industry. Over 14,000 workers in the area had to be evacuated.

The eye of the storm hit Tecolutla, a major tourist town. Over 10,000 people were evacuated.

Currently, there are no reports of deaths or serious injuries following the landfall in Mexico. However, the storm caused major damage to some areas with very heavy rains shutting down many roadways and flooding many homes.

Overall Dean is being blamed for at least 20 deaths in the Caribbean.

The storm has since been downgraded to Category 1 status.
