A major Garda hunt has begun in the Irish Midlands for four armed robbers who held up a pub at gunpoint on Monday morning. The pub, Paddy Ryans, is located in Horseleap, County Westmeath.

Paddy Ryans, a family pub, was robbed by the four men at 2am on Monday morning as staff were cleaning up and preparing to close for the night. Early reports indicate that the raiders escaped in a dark saloon car and spoke with Dublin accents.

Horseleap is a small village of a few hundred located about 20km south of Mullingar.
