At the 2008 edition of the NHL entry draft in Ottawa, Steven Stamkos' long-anticipated selection first overall by the Tampa Bay Lightning may have been overshadowed by numerous trades and signings made on the draft floor.

Before even the first pick was made, the Calgary Flames had acquired Mike Cammalleri in a three-way trade. Calgary's pick, 17th overall was traded with the Los Angeles Kings' pick, 28th overall, to the Anaheim Ducks. The Kings received the Ducks' pick, 12th overall. Later, the Flames shipped forward Alex Tanguay and fifth-round pick to the Montreal Canadiens for the 25th overall selection and a 2009 second-round pick.

The Florida Panthers also made a major trade at the draft, moving their captain, Olli Jokinen to the Phoenix Coyotes for two defencemen, Keith Ballard and Nick Boynton as well as the 49th overall selection. The Columbus Blue Jackets made a major trade of their own, picking up R.J. Umberger and the 119th pick overall from the Philadelphia Flyers in exchange for the 19th and 67th picks, overall.

Out of the first 30 picks in the draft, 17 had been traded around between teams. The first round was rich in defencemen; out of thirty players picked, half were defencemen. After Stamkos was picked first overall, the next four picks, Drew Doughty, Zach Bogosian, Alex Pietrangelo, and Luke Schenn were all blueliners. 

The hosts, w:Ottawa Senators, also made numerous moves. The Senators traded up to the 15th pick overall to draft Erik Karlsson. Earlier in the day, the had also resigned Chris Kelly to a four-year, $8.5 million contract extension. Previously, the Senators also waived goaltender Ray Emery. Emery could be bought out as early as today.
