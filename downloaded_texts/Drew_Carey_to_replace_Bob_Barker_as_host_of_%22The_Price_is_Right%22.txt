Comedian Drew Carey has announced that he will be the new host of the American game show The Price Is Right, replacing outgoing longtime host Bob Barker.

Carey revealed this on a taping of The Late Show with David Letterman, which, like The Price is Right, airs on CBS.

"It's a done deal. I'm the new host of 'The Price Is Right'," said Carey during The Late Show taping which airs tonight.

Carey was previously the star of his own sitcom on rival network ABC's sitcom The Drew Carey Show as well as the same network's improv show Whose Line Is It Anyway?. He was also recently named as host of another CBS game show, Power of 10.

Barker retired from being the host of the show for 35 years and appeared as the host for the final time on June 15.
