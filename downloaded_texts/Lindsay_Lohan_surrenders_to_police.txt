On Thursday afternoon, 21-year-old actress Lindsay Lohan turned herself in to the Beverly Hills Police Department to face charges of misdemeanor hit-and-run and the suspicion of driving under the influence. Accompanied by her lawyer, Lohan was fingerprinted and photographed by police.

On May 26 of this year, Lohan had crashed her car into a curb and hedge on Sunset Boulevard and received minor injuries. She was then driven to a Century City hospital in a friend's car. The Beverly Hills Police tracked her down at the hospital where they checked her blood-alcohol level, which was found to be above California's 0.08 percent legal limit, although the police would not disclose what level Lohan's blood-alcohol was.

After the crash, Lohan checked herself into a rehabilitation center for a 45-day stay, which was her second round of rehabilitation this year.

A court date has been scheduled for August 24, 2007.
