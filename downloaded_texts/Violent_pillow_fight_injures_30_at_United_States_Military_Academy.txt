30 cadets from the United States Military Academy at West Point (USMA) have been injured after a pillow fight became violent on August 20, officially confirmed late last week. 24 of the injured cadets suffered concussions.

The pillow fight in question was a scheduled event, and freshmen cadets at the USMA participate in the pillow fight every year as a celebration after a summer of training.

Video taken of the event shows some participants in the pillow fight did not wear helmets — despite being required to — and others reportedly stuffed their helmets, or other hard objects, into their pillow cases.

The incident was officially confirmed by the USMA on Thursday, according to the New York Times.

The causes of the injuries are being investigated, Lieutenant Colonel Christopher Kasker, spokesman of the USMA, said on Saturday. No cadets involved have been punished, he said.
