Tom Fox, an American who was among four Christian activists kidnapped in Iraq in November last year, has been found dead, according to the U.S. State Department.

FBI spokesman Noel Clay reports that a body found Friday morning was Fox, 54, of Clear Brook, Virginia.

According to Iraqi officials, Fox's body had been found with gunshot wounds and his hands tied. Officials also say that he was beaten before his death.

According to Clay, further tests will be done in the United States; the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad is still investigating. Clay also said that "the State Department continues to call for the unconditional release of all other hostages".

Al-Jazeera aired video footage on Tuesday of the other three hostages, Canadians James Loney, 41, Harmeet Sooden, 32, and Norman Kember, 74, from Great Britain. The three had not been heard from since last year. The recent video release of them was filmed on February 28.
