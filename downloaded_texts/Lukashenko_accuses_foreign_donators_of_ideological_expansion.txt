The President of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko, accused foreign funds and donators of ideological expansion in Belarus during his meeting with talented youth today.

"In recent years, activities of foreign donators, who were carrying out ideological expansion on Belarus disguised as humanitarian aid, and really stealing State's intellectual possession, was curbed," Lukashenko said.

Students, which Lukashenko met, were receivers of Belarusian presidential stipendies. He said, that the idea of domestic funds was created "in uneasy times" to keep talented students in Belarus.

Lukashenko requested last year that each trip abroad for sake of education be limited.
