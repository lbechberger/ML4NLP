Ottawa leads series 3-1. (Best of Seven)



The Pittsburgh Penguins fell to the Ottawa Senators in Game 4 of the Stanley Cup Playoffs at Mellon Arena, Tuesday night. This was not an elimination game, but surely a must win game for the Pens and they simply fell short. 

In the first period the Penguins were down early as an odd hanging puck found its way down into the net to put the Pens down 1-0. Jordan Staal, sacrificing his body in a block, knocked the puck through the air and into the net above Fleury's helmet. Though it looked like Chris Neil had slapped it down and in, the goal was credited to Jason Spezza, who had shot the puck into Staal. After review, it was clear that Neil had not touched the puck on it's way down. In the second period, the Pens rebounded with a goal of their own as Jordan Staal scored while tied up in a pile around the goal to tie the game 1-1. Midway through the third Anton Volchenkov scored the game winner to put the Sens up 2-1 in the game and 3-1 in the series. 

Both clubs played a strong game, making for an exciting atmosphere for the 17,132 in the arena. However, the problem for the Pens, as it has been through the playoffs, is the lack of shots on goal. Ray Emery faced only 11 shots in both the first and third period combined, yet in just the second period he faced 13 shots and the Penguins scored. Pittsburgh's only chance to come back in the series is to increase the number of shots on goal. All the Senators need do is win one more game and the series is theirs. 

The next game for these two clubs will be Thursday, April 19 at seven p.m. in Ottawa. The Penguinss must win this game in order to evade elimination.
