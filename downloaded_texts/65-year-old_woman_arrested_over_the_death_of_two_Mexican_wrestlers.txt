A 65-year-old woman has been arrested in connection with the deaths of two Mexican midget wrestlers. Brothers Alejandro and Alberto Perez Jimenez were found dead in their hotel room in Mexico City, Mexico. The brothers' drinks had been spiked with a fatal dose of eye drops and the pair were robbed. 

The mini wrestlers entered their hotel room with two women. Later, surveillance cameras recorded the two women leaving the hotel alone. The police traced and arrested one of the female suspects by way of a stolen cell phone that belonged to the wrestlers. Police are still searching for the second woman. 

Alejandro and Alberto wrestled on the Lucha Mini Wrestling circuit. The pair fought under the names Espectrito Jr and La Parkita, known as "The Little Ghost" and "Little Death". 

The female suspect admits meeting the wrestlers but denies poisoning them.

Prosecutors say that there are female gangs in Mexico City who drug and rob men.
