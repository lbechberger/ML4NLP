Canadian Reverend Kevin Fast has set a new record in the "heaviest vehicle pulled over 100 feet", beating his previous best. The record was set on "Live's Guinness World Record Breaker Week", an annual feature on the American talk show program Live with Regis and Kelly.

The previous record for this category, also set by Fast, was 125,660 lbs (57,000 kg). With the surprise addition of 92-pounder co-host Kelly Ripa to the International Loadstar truck being pulled, Last hauled a load of 126,292 (57,285 kg) lbs over 137 feet (42 meters).

Between pants, the Cobourg, Ontario resident told Regis Philbin and Ripa that he was "a little worried" during the pull. But the first thing he said after the attempt was "I feel great!" Paramedics were standing by, and quickly inspected him after the attempt.

Fast's only food in preparation for the event was a cup of coffee. He pulled on a rope, anchored by a parked car.

"Live's Guinness World Record Breaker Week" continues until Friday. Stuart Claxton from the company Guinness World Records has been judging all of the record attempts, as he has for many years for the program.
