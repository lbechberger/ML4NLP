Today in a press conference at Taipei City Hall, the Organizing Committee of 2009 Summer Deaflympics recently recruited a famous Taiwanese theater director Stan Sheng-chuan Lai as the Art Director of 2009 Summer Deaflympics. According to the officials, the opening, closing, and several on-site programs will be arranged by Stan Lai after his participation.

"The ability of sign language is required for everyone at any Deaflympics or world-class games related to deaf athletes, that's everyone who knows. But on the other hand, it's a great opportunity for Taipei City Government to showcase creations and cultures and to promote deaf culture since the Government won the bidding to hold the 2009 [Summer] Deaflympics. Besides of professional ability, I think that volunteers from every industry will play a great role to determine the image and result of this game [2009 Summer Deaflympics]," said Stan Lai.

With his participation, the sports and culture industries in Taiwan will make a great combination at 2009 Summer Deaflympics even before its beginning at September 2009.
