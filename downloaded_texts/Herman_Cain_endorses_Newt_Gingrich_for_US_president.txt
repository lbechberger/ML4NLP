Herman Cain, Georgia businessman and former Republican candidate for President of the United States, endorsed Newt Gingrich for the Republican nomination. Cain, who suspended his own presidential campaign last December, announced his endorsement yesterday at a Republican event in West Palm Beach, Florida.

In his endorsement of the former Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, Cain said, "I hereby officially and enthusiastically endorse Newt Gingrich for president of the United States". Cain's endorsement of Gingrich comes days before the Florida Republican primary, scheduled for this Tuesday.

Cain said Gingrich, who vowed to reporters he would stay in the race for the Republican nomination until the national nominating convention this August in Tampa, Florida regardless of Tuesday's results, has been going through a "sausage grinder" during this election cycle.

Cain suspended his own campaign for the Republican party nomination for the presidency of the United States last December after allegations of sexual misconduct and a decline in his popularity among voters.

In a poll of likely Florida voters released yesterday by Reuters and Ipsos, Mitt Romney led Newt Gingrich by an 11 percentage point margin, three points higher than Friday. Out of those who responded, 43% supported Romney to Gingrich's 32%. In the poll released Friday, the results were 41% to 33% for Romney and Gingrich, respectively.
