The Vista, a student paper at the University of Central Oklahoma in Edmond, Oklahoma, has published a cartoon including one of caricatures of the Prophet Mohammad. The cartoon itself has been perceived as being very offensive, besides the fact that it includes one of the infamous caricatures.
The cartoon was made by Cary Stringfield, the paper's cartoonist. It shows two men of middle eastern origin with the one on the right holding one of the Mohammad caricatures (Caricature: the one with the bomb in his turban). The man on the left is shown as saying: "I'm not sure this response is appropriate for that cartoon." (Pointing to the background of violent protest). The man on the right replies by saying: "I agree, if we only had a Nuclear Bomb, then we could show them."
The Vista is published twice a week on Tuesdays and Thursdays. The cartoon was published on Tuesday February 7, 2006. Since then there has been some/many verbal/written protests to the paper. The paper published an explanation in their Thursday paper which is linked to below.

Since then, some have found it hard to decide if the cartoon or the follow-up article was more offensive. The Muslim Student Organization at UCO has issued a letter with numerous signatories to the paper to protest their distaste at the inappropriate content. But in the feedback posted on their website, some readers have supported the cartoon as representing freedom of speech.
