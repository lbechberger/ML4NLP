Senator Jay Rockefeller (D), great-grandson of oil tycoon John D. Rockefeller and chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said that President Bush's "Iraq adventure" was draining funds from homeland security and other domestic priorities such as education, health care, the environment.
 
Rockefeller also added that he was concerned that the Bush administration was going towards a military confrontation with Iran. He said, "Do I think it's possible that the president could get us involved marginally or even more fully in Iran as a way of distracting us from the war on terror, and from Iraq, as a way of getting past the elections in 2008? I don't want to believe that. But after what I have been through with him â€¦ yes, I worry about it enormously."
