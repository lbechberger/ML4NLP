Miami Dolphins running back Ricky Williams, who has applied for reinstatement to the NFL, told ESPN Radio's Dan Patrick on Friday that he hasn't gotten high on drugs "in maybe three years." Williams credited yoga with replacing drugs to ease stress.

Williams was suspended in April 2006 for violating the NFL's Substance Abuse Policy. Reinstatement to the league requires clinical evaluation and sending a hand-written letter to Roger Goodell, commissioner of the NFL. Williams stated: For the most part, as long as you follow the rules, you have a pretty good shot to be reinstated. Half of it is testing and the other half is you have to talk to someone on a weekly basis.

During the radio broadcast, Patrick asked Williams when the last time he had been drug tested. Williams' anwser was Two minutes ago. and that he had passed.

Williams blamed the high levels of stress involved in playing football with his use of Marijuana. He said the only way to deal with it was "to go home, relax on the couch, roll up a joint and take a couple of puffs."

Williams told Patrick during the interview that he hadn't spoken with new Dolphins head coach Cam Cameron yet. Addressing what the Dolphins may or may not choose to do with him, Williams said that he would be "fine with whatever happens."

Williams said, when asked why he wants to return to the NFL: "For me, it's a test to see if all this work I've done is really worth something. If I can go to the NFL and have success, that would speak a lot for yoga and what I've learned and offer a lot of people who have dealt with the same issues I have a way out."
