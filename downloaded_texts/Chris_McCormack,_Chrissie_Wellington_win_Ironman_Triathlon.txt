"Normal" in the 2007 Ironman Triathlon World Championship was only the fact the sun rose in the east, as shortly past the swim start the day brought forth a hot and cloudless Hawaiian sky; injuries and illnesses to many; DNFs for two years worth of defending champions; and a first-time winner.

Australian Chris McCormack, placing 2nd in 2006, passed Aussie Craig Alexander in the marathon and further scorched the Queen Kaahumanu KaÊ»ahumanu Highway with a 2:42:02 run to claim the world title in 8:15:34.

In even more excitement, rookie (her first Ironman length race was seven weeks ago in Korea) Chrissie Wellington, from Great Britain, claimed the women's title finished in 9:08:45.

The 6:45 a.m. Hawaii Standard Time start to the 2.4 mile swim, 112 mile time-trial, and a 26.2 mile marathon saw a cascade of unfortunates to favorites. Defending 2006 champions Normann Stadler and Michellie Jones and 2005 champion Faris Al-Sultan were struck down with stomach ailments; six-time winner and 2005 champion Natascha Badmann totaled her bike after crashing into road cone; and Luke Bell was sidelined with a leg injury.

But a sense of "normal" returned later in the day as the temperature and winds rose and as many of the 1,788 starters completed before the October 14, 2007 12:00am deadline.
