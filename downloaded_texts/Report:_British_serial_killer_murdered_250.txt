The Sixth Report of the Harold Shipman Inquiry, released today, concludes that British family doctor, Shipman, killed about 250 during his career. Shipman was arrested for the murder of Kathleen Grundy in 1998, and concerns arose around this time about the excess number of deaths among his patients.

Shipman was found guilty in 2000 of 15 counts of murder and one of forgery of a will, and jailed for life. The on-going Inquiry, chaired by Dame Janet Smith DBE, began soon after to investigate his past, as well as other suspicious deaths linked to the doctor.

According to the Sixth Report of the Inquiry, it is now thought that he may have begun killing at the very start of his career, possibly through recklessly prescribing drugs, in 1971. It is thought he later developed a deliberate intention to kill, mainly targeting the elderly. His first murder may have been as early as in March 1971, and the Inquiry concluded he continued to kill until 1998, the year of his arrest.

Shipman was found dead, hung with his bedsheets in Wakefield Prison on 13 January last year, raising questions about what measures could have prevented this apparent suicide and another investigation, this time by Prisons and Probation Ombudsman Stephen Shaw.
