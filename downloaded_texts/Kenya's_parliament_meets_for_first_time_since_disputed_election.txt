Kenya's new Parliament convened for the first time since the country's disputed December 27 election, but politician's on opposing sides took part in a heated discussion over who would be the new speaker of the party.

Kenyan opposition politicians argued with followers of re-elected President Mwai Kibaki over how to pick a new parliamentary speaker.

When a discussion into how the speaker should be decided started, lawmakers with Raila Odinaga's opposition Orange Democratic Movement insisted the election for speaker be held by open ballot; Mr. Kibaki's supporters demanded the vote be secret.

The discussion took place for over an hour politicians from both sides took part in a discussion where anger was clearly shown, before the two parties decided a secret ballot was acceptable.

"The standing orders are very clear that members will be given a ballot. Can you show us where it says secret ballot? We went into election with secret ballot, you stole the vote, we cannot trust you anymore," said William Ruto, a senior adviser for Odigna.

After a first round of voting, the Orange Democratic Movement candidate had a narrow lead, necessitating another ballot. If no-one gets two-thirds majority after two rounds the speaker will be elected by a simple majority in the third round.

It was an argument like that seen in Parliament that has led many Kenyans to say they have felt abandoned by their leaders in the weeks of chaos that followed the December 27 vote.
