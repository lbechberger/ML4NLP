The South African national rugby team has defeated the Welsh equivalent 43-17 in a home rugby test match at Bloemfontein.

South Africa scored four tries to defeat current Six Nations champion Wales. Conrad Jantjes, Jean de Villers, Pierre Spies and Percy Montgomery all scored tries, Montgomery having been substituted on in the second half. Welsh tries were scored by Jamie Roberts and Shane Wiliams and all remaining points came from conversions and penalties.

Stephen Jones converted a try for Wales, while Butch James converted all of South Africa's. After CJ van der Linde and Richard Hibbard got into a fight, both men were sent off. It was the first match in charge for new South Africa coach Peter de Villiers.

Wales captain Ryan Jones later explained his team's defeat. "We made too many mistakes. South Africa capitalized whenever we lost possession, but we have no excuses," he said.
