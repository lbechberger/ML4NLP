The popular rapper Obie Trice was shot while driving on a Detroit Freeway. Trice exited into a nearby suburb, where his girlfriend, uninjured in the incident, waved down police. Trice has now been released from Providence Hospital, where a speedy recovery is expected. There are currently no suspects in the shooting.

Obie was first signed after Eminem introduced him to D12 member Bizarre, and appeared briefly in the movie 8 Mile. He is currently working on his second album.
