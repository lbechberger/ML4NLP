White House Press Secretary Scott McClellan announced his resignation on Wednesday, and advisor Karl Rove has given up his policy-making duties, continuing a series of personnel changes in the administration of U.S. President George W. Bush.

"I have given it my all sir and I have given you my all sir, and I will continue to do so as we transition to a new press secretary," said McClellan, who has served as press secretary since July 2003. He is expected to remain on the job until his replacement is named. Among people under consideration to replace McClellan include Fox News anchor Tony Snow, former Treasury spokesman Rob Nichols, and former Pentagon spokeswoman Victoria Clarke.

Rove, who was instrumental in managing Bush's two presidential campaigns, will serve as a deputy chief of staff and senior advisor to President Bush, focusing on long term strategic planning, according to CNN, which quoted a senior White House official. Joel Kaplan, the acting deputy budget director of the Office of Management and Budget, has been named to succeed Rove. 

McClellan's departure comes shortly after the resignation of longtime Chief of Staff Andrew Card and the appointment of Josh Bolten, former director of the Office of Management and Budget, as Card's replacement. More personnel changes are expected in the next few weeks.

Bush announced Tuesday that trade representative Rob Portman will assume Bolten's former position as head of the OMB.
