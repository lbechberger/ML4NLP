A Pakistan official admitted earlier this month that Abdul Khan, one of the country's nuclear scientists, provided centrifuges essential to high-grade nuclear fuel and weapon production to Iran. 

Centrifuges are used to refine Uranium fuel, a dual-use product which can be used in nuclear reactors or in nuclear weapons. The Pakistani government denied any knowledge or approval of the transfer of technology.

Reportedly, Pakistan has refused to allow anyone outside the Pakistani government to interview Mr. Khan, who remains under house arrest at his home in Pakistan.
