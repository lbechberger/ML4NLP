Former Labour Party MP and Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Mo Mowlam, 55, is reported to be critically ill at King's College Hospital, London.

According to a King's College Hospital spokeswoman, Ms. Mowlam is "critical but stable," and added that her family did not want further details disclosed. 

Ms. Mowlam survived a brain tumour in the 1990s, which saw her lose her hair, forcing her to wear a wig. 

Many state that her charismatic personality played an important role in the Northern Ireland peace talks, leading to the Good Friday Agreement in 1998 and an IRA ceasefire.
