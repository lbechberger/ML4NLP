Canadian jazz star Diana Krall has given birth Wednesday to twin boys named Dexter Henry Lorcan and Frank Harlan James in New York City, where the couple live.

"We are ecstatic!" and the "mother and sons are doing splendidly," reads a statement released by Krall and her husband, English musician Elvis Costello, best known for songs such as "Pump It Up" and "Alison".

The twins are Krall's first children. Costello already has a child from an earlier marriage.

Costello, 52, and Krall, 42, shared the birth of their two sons on their third wedding anniversary.

"I have twins on my mother's side," Krall told People magazine in September. 

Krall, born in Nanaimo, British Columbia, who is a Grammy award winner, and was named an officer of the Order of Canada in 2005, released her latest album titled "From This Moment On" in September.

The couple married three years ago in a ceremony held at Elton John's mansion in Surrey, England in December 2003. Paul McCartney and Pamela Wallin, Canada's consul general to New York were invited among the 150 guests.
