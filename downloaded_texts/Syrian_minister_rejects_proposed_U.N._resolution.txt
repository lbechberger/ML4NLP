Syria has rejected a proposed United Nations resolution, backed by both the United States and France, for a cease fire in the 2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict. 

Syria's foreign minister has said that the resolution is a "a recipe for the continuation of the war," and "adopted Israel's point of view only."

Syria has also warned that their armed forces are under orders to respond immediately if Israel attacks. Syria's foreign minister said that "If Israel attacks Syria by any means, on the ground, by air, our leadership ordered the armed forces to reply immediately," and that "Syria is ready for the possibility of a regional war if the Israeli aggression continues."
