For the second time in a row, Team Canada has won the gold medal IIHF World Junior Hockey Championship. In an upset 5â€”0 win over Russia the team clinched the title in Vancouver, BC.

Canada was undefeated this year posting a 6 wins and 0 losses record. Going into the competition the United States and Russia were favored for the gold and silver, but a disappointing tie with Switzerland and a loss to Canada during the round-robin knocked the U.S. team from the running

The back-to-back wins are the first since the 1996-1997 wins for team Canada.

Russia won the silver, and Finland won the bronze in an even more surprising and hard fought game against the U.S.
