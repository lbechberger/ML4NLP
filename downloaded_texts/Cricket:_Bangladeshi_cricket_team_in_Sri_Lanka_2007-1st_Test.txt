The match started out poorly for the Bangladeshis as they were bowled out for 89 in the first innings. The main cause of this was the outstanding bowling of Muralitharan who took a five wicket haul. The Sri Lankans capitalised on this and started building a mammoth of an innings of 577 before declaring six wickets down. Centuries from Michael Vandort, Mahela Jayawardene, Prasanna Jayawardene, and Chaminda Vaas , and a huge 7th wicket partnership of 223 runs, helped Sri Lanka post the total. 

Bangladesh started out their second innings positively and showed resistance to Sri Lanka's bowlers to get to 233/5 at the end of Day 3. Early on Day 4 however, Lasith Malinga turned Sri Lanka's fortunes around and ripped through the tail end of Bangladesh's lineup with 3 wickets in 30 minutes to wrap up a one-sided Test with a comprehensive innings and 234 runs victory.
