This past weekend, an important event in the intermicronational community took place. Prince Christopher I and Princess Erin, the Royal Family of the Principality of Vikesland, a micronation located in Alberta, arrived in Espera, the capital city of the Republic of Molossia, another micronation located near Reno, Nevada, for what would be the two countries' first ever formal summit.

The Republic of Molossia, which declared its independence in 1998, has played an unparalleled role in the development of small nations. At only three years old, the Principality of Vikesland is a relative newcomer to the world of micronations. However, despite its age, Vikesland seeks to become a major power in the intermicronational community. The summit was successful in solidifying the two countries' already strong friendship.

Luckily, President Baugh was available to speak with. In addition to the summit, he told of his plans for the revitalization of the League of Small Nations, a nearly defunct organization devoted to the prosperity of all land-claiming micronations, and the current state of the intermicronational community.
