On Sunday Peter Capaldi was named as the twelfth Doctor on BBC's Doctor Who. The announcement was made as part of a live broadcast by the BBC.

Capaldi had been considered by executive producer Steven Moffat for the role of the eleventh doctor before Matt Smith was ultimately chosen. The role became vacant after Smith announced earlier this year that he would be leaving the show. Capaldi said of his selection for the role, "Being asked to play the Doctor is an amazing privilege. [...] Like the Doctor himself I find myself in a state of utter terror and delight. I can't wait to get started."

Capaldi's first screen appearance in this role is scheduled to air on television in late 2013. He will be the second oldest Doctor in the show's history, with only the original Doctor being older.

As of earlier today, the official BBC Doctor Who Facebook page has 138,238 likes and 47,809 shares for the news of Capaldi taking on the role.
