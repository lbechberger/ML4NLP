A female suicide bomber from the militant separatist group LTTE disguised herself as a pregnant woman and detonated a bomb inside the Sri Lankan Army HQ in Colombo yesterday evening. Eight soldiers were killed in the attack and Lieutenant General Sarath Fonseka was severely wounded. 

The Sri Lanka Air Force launched retaliatory strikes against rebel positions this morning at 00:30 GMT. This attack threatens to put an end to the uneasy ceasefire between the Tamil rebels and the Sri Lankan government that has been in place since 2002.
