On Friday morning, Student's Day was celebrated in the most schools across Chile. Student's Day was created in May 11, 1990 by Chile's Ministry of Education. The same day, the Supreme Decree N° 524 was validated, whereby also authorized the functioning of Student's Centres in the High Education schools.


At Colegio Preciosa Sangre, Pichilemu celebration started at 8:30 AM local time (1230 UTC). Students, grouped by grade, shared a cup of milk and sandwiches. Competitions and games were originally planned to take place in the school's yard, but due to adverse weather, these were moved to an old, large room. The school was split into two teams, Roja (red) and Verde (green). The event was organized by Nicole Grez, Carol Piña, and Paola Sepúlveda, amidst others, and the judges included Angélica Miranda and Mother Loreto Fuentes.

The first of the activities was the performance of a Pichileminian metal band, that covered Metallica's songs. Subsequently, started the games. The first one consisted of the imitation of a well-known musical artist. The Roja alliance prepared the imitation of Ráfaga's Luna Luna. The Verde alliance performed a sketch with Right Said Fred's I'm Too Sexy. Both alliances gained points for this activity.

The next activity in the morning was gymkhana, that consisted if three steps for students from first to eight grades of Basic Education:
* Put a thread through a needle.
* Eat a pear while playing with a basketball ball.
* Pump up and burst an inflatable globe.

From the first to fourth grades of High Education:
* Take out a coin from a plate full of flour.
* Eat a sandwich with hot chilli, and drink a glass of Coke.
* Put a thread through two needles. (Between this step and the fourth, they have to chew the same pear).
* Pump up and burst two globes.
