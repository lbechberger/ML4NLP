Citizens from Punta Arenas, Chile, the world's southernmost city and capital of the Magallanes and Antártica Chilena Region, remained on strike Wednesday after Chilean President Sebastián Piñera announced an increase in natural gas prices by 16.8 percent, in that region.

Citizens from Punta Arenas and politicians are demanding that Piñera maintain subsidies on natural gas. "We want dialogue, to continue talking in a serious and responsible way about the future of Magallanes," Ena von Baer, the government spokeswoman, said on Wednesday morning.

Piñera's government justifies the increase of the gas price "as a technical decision in response to its declining reserves." Two persons were killed amid the protests in the capital of Magallanes, on Tuesday night.
