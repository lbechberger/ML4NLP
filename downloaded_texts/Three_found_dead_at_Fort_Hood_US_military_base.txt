A man and two children were found dead this morning in a home at Fort Hood, a US Army base in Texas. Early reports indicate the deceased were military dependents. The latest reports indicate cause of death to be unclear.

As of 1:00pm local time (0500 UTC), military investigators had not released the names of the deceased. Officials did note, however, that "no further threat to the community" exists. Officials have yet to confirm if foul play is suspected in the deaths.

Approximately 45,000 service members are currently assigned to the military base, located in central Texas. In 2009, Major Nidal Hassan shot and killed 13 people and wounded 30 others at the base's Readiness Processing Center.
