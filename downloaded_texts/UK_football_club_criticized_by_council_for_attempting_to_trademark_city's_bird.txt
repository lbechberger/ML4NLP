Liverpool F.C., an association football club located in Liverpool, a British city, has been criticized by the city council for attempting to trademark the Liver Bird, a symbol used to represent the city of Liverpool, and its football club.

Flo Clucas, the Deputy leader of Liverpool City Council, expressed her concern over the move. "I have some very real concerns over it," she stated. "They do already have their crest trademarked, but they have no right of ownership to claim the bird, or any version of the bird, as their own."

"...Not only does it appear on the Royal Charter for the council, but it is also used by local businesses and schools," she continued. "It belongs to the city and nobody has a right to claim it exclusively as the own. It's a symbol for the city."

The football club attempted to respond to these concerns by asserting that "Liverpool Football Club is seeking to trademark only its own specific version of the Liver Bird, to combat its use in counterfeit merchandise."

However, Clucas stated that although "the club also says they have no intention of charging organisations that want to use it," there is no guarantee that this will still be the case in the future, so, according to Clucas, residents of the city may have to pay for the use of the bird in the future if the trademark is approved.

The council is seeking legal advice over the application.

Liverpool F.C. formed in 1892, and is currently managed by Rafa Benitez. They have qualified for the Champions League in every one of the last four seasons, and they are currently second place in the English Premier League, and they have won five of their last six matches.

The club's home ground is the Anfield stadium, and the main focus of their crest is the Liver Bird.
