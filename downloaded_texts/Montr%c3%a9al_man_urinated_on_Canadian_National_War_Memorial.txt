A man urinated on National War Memorial in Ottawa. 

A retired Canadian military major, Michel Pilon, saw the man and two of his friends urinate on the memorial at about 11 p.m. Saturday. The man was photographed urinating on the National War Memorial in Ottawa. The 23-year-old was pictured smiling and making a hand gesture toward the camera. 

Ottawa police are looking for the 23-year-old Montreal man and his two friends, both under the age of 18. "They should have more respect," said, Ottawa police Sgt. Jean Lamothe. "This is a shrine to people who fought for us in the wars."

They could be charged with public urination or behaving in an offensive manner, and fined $125 or required to do a day of community work.
