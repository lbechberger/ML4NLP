Aruban police have made an arrest in relation to the Natalee Holloway case. 

Holloway, 18, was visiting the island from Alabama and has not been seen since May 30, 2005, with Joran van der Sloot and brothers Deepak and Satish Kalpoe. All three boys were arrested as suspects in the disappearance in June 2005, but were released when a court ruled that there was not enough evidence to continue holding the boys.

A spokeswoman for the public prosecutor's office in Aruba, Mariaine Croes, said that authorities are not yet prepared to release details about the arrest, but did say that the suspect is 19 and that his initials are "G.V.C.". Names of suspects arrested in Aruba are not usually released to the media, so authorities use initials in place of a full name.

Family members and relatives of Natalee have posted a US$250,000 for information leading to an arrest in the case. A US$1 million dollar reward has also been posted for the safe return of Natalee.
