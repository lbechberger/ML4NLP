Police have evacuated portions of capitol hill and have told staff members to lock their office doors and "stay inside" as police search the Rayburn Building floor by floor after gunfire was reported.

"We have not gotten any reports of anybody being captured, anybody being arrested. We have not identified anybody who may have a weapon on them at this time. Right now we want to err on the side of caution. Lives could be at risk. If we have a gunman in the building we certainly want to find him," said Capitol Hill Police spokeswoman, Kimberly Schneider.

"Lives could be at risk. If we have a gunman in the building we certainly want to find him. It's premature to assume that it may not be a gunman," she added.

People were also told to close and lock their doors inside the building. "The request is that everyone stay in the room. Please close the doors. Please stay in the room," said Michigan Republican and House Intelligence Committee head, Peter Hoekstra.

One person has been taken to the hospital.

Police initially responded to "shots fired and the smell of smoke," said Senate Sergeant at Arms Bill Pickle. He also said that fireworks could be to blame. "There could have been something like fireworks, any kind of a prankster."
