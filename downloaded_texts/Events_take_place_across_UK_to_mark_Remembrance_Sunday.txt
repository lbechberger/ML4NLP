Today is Remembrance Sunday, an annual observance in which Britons killed in wars around the world are remembered. Many events have taken place across the United Kingdom today and earlier this week, including many affiliated with the Poppy Appeal. 

Queen Elizabeth II led the main event to mark the occasion at the Cenotaph in London, with events also taking place in North Staffordshire, Coventry, Wales, Lytham, St Anne's, Northern Ireland and Birmingham, in addition to small local events across the country.

North Staffordshire marked the event when television presenter Nick Hancock released 15,500 poppy petals, representing the 15,500 British soldiers to be killed while in conflict since World War II.

This weekend's football match between Coventry FC and Crystal Palace featured the players from both sides holding a minutes silence around a giant poppy.

The Royal British Legion sent its "Poppy Man" sculpture around Wales and Northern Island to draw attention to it's appeal, while in Lytham and St Anne's, the wife and daughter of the deceased comedian Les Dawson launched the appeal for funds. Tracy, the wife stated that "Les was in the army, where he served as a Trooper, in the 2nd Dragoon Guards (Queen's Bays), he did lots of work for charity, and the Poppy Appeal was one of the ones close to his heart. I feel it is so fitting that I am able to help."

In Birmingham, a team from the Royal Marines Commando, abseiled down a hotel to mark the appeal.

Services were also held in Iraq and Afghanistan by British troops, in addition to church services across the country.
