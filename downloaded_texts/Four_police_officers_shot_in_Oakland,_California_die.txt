All four police officers shot in Oakland, California on March 21, have died in local hospitals, according to reports. The shooting is described as the deadliest for police officers in Oakland's history.

"It's in these moments that words are extraordinarily inadequate," said the mayor of Oakland, Ron Dellums during a press conference. Governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger also offered his condolences.

"All four officers dedicated their lives to public safety and selflessly worked to protect the people of Oakland. Our thoughts and prayers are with the families of those lost, the Oakland Police Department and law enforcement officers throughout California during this difficult time," said Schwarzenegger in a statement to the press.

The shooting began around the 7400 block of the city's MacArthur Boulevard at approximately 1:15 p.m. (PDT) on March 21, after two motorcycle officers pulled over another vehicle. After doing so, the officers were both fired upon by the suspect driving the car.

At approximately 3:20 p.m., an unnamed caller reported sight of the suspects on a near street, East 27th Street, causing police to create a blockade, surrounding the suspect. This is where the other two officers were shot, this time in an exchange of gunfire while attempting to take the alleged shooter of the two officers into custody. The suspect was killed by police gunfire. The suspect's name was Lovelle Mixon, aged 26, who had a warrant issued for his arrest after his bail was revoked for violation of parole. 

All four of the officers were taken to Highland Hospital in critical condition where they all later died of their injuries. Their names were: Sergeant Erv Romans, aged 43, Sergeant Dan Sakai, 35, Officer John Hege aged 41 and Sergeant Mark Dunakin, 40.
