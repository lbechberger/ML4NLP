The current financial crisis have recently caused the Wielka Orkiestra Świątecznej Pomocy (Great Orchestra of Christmas Charity), one of the top Polish charity organizations, to reduce spending on The Great Finale events, which are scheduled to take place on January 11, 2009. As a result, all major events in the city of Wrocław, have been canceled.

Although many companies have declared they will help with organizing and will provide essential products for volunteers, the organizers are still in need financial aid for concerts and other mass events.

Every year, during The Great Finale, the Orchestra's volunteers collect several million zloties, which are then given to various health-care organizations to help young patients. Since 1993, when the first Finale took place, the Orchestra has collected near $100 million (~290 million złoty).
