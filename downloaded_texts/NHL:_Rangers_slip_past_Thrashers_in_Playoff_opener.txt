Rangers lead series 1-0. (Best of Seven)



The New York Rangers scored the first two goals and never looked back, defeating the Thrashers before 18,857 at Philips Arena in Atlanta, Georgia. The game was the first in the best-of-seven series. Never since their inception into the NHL in 1997, have the Thrashers advanced to the playoffs until this season, and will have to wait for their first ever playoff victory. Despite a desperate last minute power play, Atlanta couldn't manage to beat Rangers goaltender Henrik Lundqvist, who has shined this season. Lundqvist was solid again tonight, stopping 21 of 24 shots faced. 

Pascal Dupuis of the Atlanta Thrashers was sent into the boards in the first period, and had to come off the ice for some time before returning to score the game's final goal. Kari Lehtonen, goaltender for the Thrashers entered the game with a 2.79 goals-against average. Lehtonen allowed four goals, while stopping 34 shots.
