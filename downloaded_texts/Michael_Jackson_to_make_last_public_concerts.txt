Dubbed as the 'King of Pop music', Michael Jackson says he will go one last concert tour in the United Kingdom beginning in July. Jackson had said after a performance at the O2 Arena in London, England on Wednesday that he calls the tour his "final curtain calls".

"These will be my final shows ... performances in London. When I say this is it, I mean this is it. I'll be performing the songs my fans want to hear. This is it, this is really it, this is the final curtain call," said Jackson after the concert. 

Tim Leiweke, CEO of Anschutz Entertainment Group (AEG), earlier told Billboard that the tour in the UK will consist of somewhere between 20-25 concerts, all to be held at the O2, starting July 8.

"We spent two years working with Michael trying to get him comfortable with this," said Leiweke to Billboard, who also said that Jackson's health is not an issue. "Despite everything you read about him, he was fine. The man took a physical for us to go do these concerts". 

Jackson's last major concert tour was in 2001. It is also the first major public appearance he will be making since 2005, when a jury aquitted him in a trial where he was charged with child molestation.
