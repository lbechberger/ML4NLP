Ferrari driver Kimi Räikkönen won the FIA Formula-1 2007 Santander British Grand Prix on the Silverstone Circuit at Silverstone, Northamptonshire, England.

The triumphant Lewis Hamilton, who won the pole in the qualification yesterday was able to maintain his position on the first part of the race, but lose it on his first pit-stop. Moreover, his teammate for McLaren-Mercedes Fernando Alonso passed Kimi in the same way while Finn was on his first pit-stop and was in the lead before the Spaniard's second pit-stop. After McLaren drivers refuel themselves just a few very fast laps became decisive to secure Kimi's podium. Lewis was unable to overtake Fernando thus finishing third.

Another Ferrari driver Felipe Massa had a problem on the start causing him to start from the pit-lane, but broke through to the fifth place, finishing right on the back of Robert Kubica from BMW Sauber. Felipe was pushing on the Poland driver through the whole third part of the race.

With the 6th place of Nick Heidfeld, another BMW driver, the BMW Sauber team once again overtook Renault drivers. 

Both Heikki Kovalainen and Giancarlo Fisichella were the first in one lap behind the leaders closing the top eight.

Honda drivers finished 9th and 10th.

This race became the 9th consecutive podium finish for Lewis Hamilton in his rookie season who is leading the Drivers' Championship with 70 pts, 12 ahead of Alonso.
