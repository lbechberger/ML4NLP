The Northeastern region of the United States has been blanketed by a severe heat wave since Sunday, with temperatures predicted to reach over a hundred degrees Fahrenheit Tuesday.

The US National Weather Service (NWS) issued warnings of severe heat for most of the East Coast as well as some inland states, which are predicted to have temperatures as high as 102 degrees Fahrenheit. Factoring in humidity levels in a measurement called a heat index, temperatures will be even higher; New York City's heat index could reach 107 degrees.

An NWS meteorologist, Brian Korty in Maryland, said that hot air is "sitting over the top of us, and it's not really going to budge much for the next day or two," after which cooler air coming from the Atlantic Ocean is expected to arrive.

Officials warned of health risks from the high heat; an NWS statement said to "check on your elderly relatives and neighbors. Coaches, trainers, camp counselors should remain alert for signs of heat exhaustion and heat stroke. It will be so hot this afternoon that the weather could affect anyone no matter their age or overall health. Please consider postponing strenuous activities or work outs."

Electric utility companies are concerned about the effect of the heat on infrastructure; New York's Consolidated Edison said that several hundred people were without power Tuesday morning. In Philadelphia, as many as 8,000 people were without power Monday; the number has decreased to around 400, but is expected to rise again later on Tuesday.
