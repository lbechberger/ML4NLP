Bolton Wanderers F.C. player Fabrice Muamba has been discharged from the London Chest Hospital, having been taken there in the aftermath of experiencing a cardiac arrest during the first half of a quarter final tie between his team and Tottenham Hotspur on March 17 this year. 

Muamba has said he is "naturally very pleased to be discharged from hospital". A spokesperson for Barts and The London NHS Trust clarified: "[We] can confirm that Fabrice Muamba has now been discharged following several weeks of treatment. All our staff wish him the very best in his ongoing recovery."

Muamba thanked the workers at the London Chest Hospital who assisted him in the recovery process. "Their dedication, professionalism and expertise is simply amazing and I will forever be in their debt. I also wish to say thank you to all the many well-wishers who have sent thousands of messages of support," Muamba commented. "Now I am out of hospital, I am looking forward to continuing my recovery and spending precious time with my family," he added. Owen Coyle, the current manager of Bolton Wanderers, described the news as "absolutely fantastic", going on to add that "everyone at the club is delighted" and the treatment provided to Muamba by the London Chest Hospital was "outstanding".

24-year-old Muamba was reportedly 'dead' for 78 minutes in the aftermath of his cardiac arrest at the match in White Hart Lane, London as paramedics attempted to restart his heart. Jonathan Tobin, Bolton Wanderers club doctor, explained in March: "It was 48 minutes when he collapsed to reaching hospital and a further 30 minutes after that. He was, in effect, dead at that time. We were fearing the worst and didn't think we would get the recovery we had." Tobin described Muamba's recovery as "incredible". However, Muamba's future in professional football appears uncertain at this stage.
