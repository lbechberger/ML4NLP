The UK’s Prince Harry of Wales is to be presented with a humanitarian award for Distinguished Humanitarian Leadership by the Atlantic Council, according to an announcement made by St James’s Palace today. 

The recognition is for serving war veterans and the armed forces. He is to receive the award in Washington, D.C. on May 7 at the Atlantic Council’s yearly awards dinner. 

Prince Harry means to accept the award on behalf of his brother, the Duke of Cambridge, and the Foundation of Prince William and Prince Harry, an effort established in 2009 that enables the princes to advance their philanthropic aspirations.

"Prince Harry will use the award to pay tribute to British and American veterans' charities for their achievements in helping to rehabilitate wounded servicemen and women, and to reintegrate those who have served in the armed forces into civilian life,” said a St James’s Palace spokesperson.

Prince Harry also supports other charities including Help for Heroes, Army Benevolent Fund, and Walking With The Wounded. He also helps run Sentebale, an organization that supports underprivileged children in Lesotho, Africa.
