Roberto Cipresso, one of Italy's most respected winemakers, has gone into business with Savanna Samson, a New York porn star, whose real name is Natalie Oliveros.

The wine world had previously suspected that Cipresso's collaboration with Samson would be little more than a publicity stunt. Such fears evaporated when U.S. wine expert Robert Parker rated their effort at 91, describing it as "an outstanding wine of exceptional complexity and character".

Samson's husband, Daniel Oliveros, who introduced her to the winemaker, is a Manhattan wine merchant. The couple met when she was a dancer at Scores, a popular strip club. 

Savanna Samson's last film earned her the porn industry's highest award for best all-girl sex scene. Her best-known films are Big Blowout, Fetish Underground and Poke Her.

Roberto Cipresso's previous investor was Pope John Paul II.
