Alex Rodriguez's home run streak was extended Tuesday in the Yankee's win over the Twins in Minneapolis. A-Rod hit a two-run shot off of Twins starter Boof Bonser in the first inning, making it the fourth game in a row that he has cleared the fence. Bonser gave up six hits and seven runs in the four and one third innings he pitched, including a Johnny Damon three-run homer over the right field wall in the fifth inning. before being relieved by Jesse Crain. Dennys Reyes pitched the final inning, giving up three runs to bring the Yankee's lead to nine runs.

Andy Pettitte threw six shutout innings, allowing only four hits. Minnesota's only run came from a Jason Kubel sacrifice fly in the seventh inning, scoring Justin Morneau from third base. The Twins had many opportunities to score early, but ended up leaving their runners in scoring position without any hits to bring them home.

The Twins and Yankees will wrap up the series tomorrow, each hoping for a win to stay above .500. Mike Mussina will be starting for the Yanks, and Ramon Ortiz will be starting for the Twins.
