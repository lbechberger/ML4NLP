Approximately four thousand people rallied in an anti-government protest in Baku, Azerbaijan on Saturday. 

The protest took place on the outskirts of the city to oppose alleged electoral fraud during the most recent presidential election that returned President Ilham Aliyev to office for his third consecutive term. The protesters accused the government of voter intimidation and ballot stuffing, and were rallying in a demand for a new poll. 

Although the protest had been initially approved by authorities, police began to use violence against protesters when scuffles broke out amongst the group.

According to Reuters, some protesters were beaten and detained by police. Interfax-Azerbaijan reported approximately 10 people were detained during the protest.
