Ten people, 7 of which are children, are dead, and at least 17 injured as a bomb went off in Diyarbakir, Turkey. Police say that the bomb was set off by a timer on a mobile phone. The blast happened inside a park in the Baglar region of Diyarbakir.

A group called the Kurdistan Freedom Falcons or TAC has claimed to be responsible for the blasts. The group threatened Turkey last week when it posted a message on their website saying that they would turn the country "into hell."

"Our grief is great for the victims of this terror, especially as our children have been the victims," said Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the Turkish Prime Minister.
