Three men suspected of involvement in the July 7 suicide bombings in London have been detained by terrorist police, in the first major arrests in the case following the attacks following a lengthy police investigation.

Two of the suspects were detained at Manchester Airport while they were attempting to board a plane to Pakistan, while the other was found in Leeds.

The arrests in Manchester occurred around 1300 GMT while the arrest in Leeds took place around 1600 GMT.

Fifty-two people were killed in the 2005 bombings on three London Underground trains and buses. The devices used were detonated by four bombers.

Police are able to hold the suspects for twenty-eight days under the new anti-terror laws. The four men have been held on the suspicion of the commission, preparation, or instigation of terrorist acts.
