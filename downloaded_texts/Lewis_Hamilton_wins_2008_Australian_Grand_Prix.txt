Vodafone McLaren Mercedes driver Lewis Hamilton starting from pole wins the FIA Formula-1 2008 ING Australian Grand Prix on the Albert Park Circuit in Melbourne.

Nick Heidfeld took second for BMW Sauber. Nico Rosberg scoring his first Formula One podium in third and a long-awaited for Williams team.

A thrilling race ended with only seven drivers met the chequered flag. It all started when Giancarlo Fisichella, a Force India experienced driver, was out upon the start. His younger teammate Adrian Sutil pitted a couple of laps later and left his car.


Fernando Alonso, who is back in Renault, drove stably although his car could not compete fully with McLaren's. Heikki Kovalainen overtook him on the last lap, but the Spaniard easily made a detour around McLaren and finished 4th.

Rubens Barrichello made a great deal for Honda with a 6th result. The last year decline appear to be nothing to worry about now for the team. Still Barrichello was disqualified a time after the race for leaving the pit-lane under red lights.

Kazuki Nakajima scored two additional points for Williams (three after disqualification of Barrichello).

The last point was grabbed by Sébastien Bourdais (two after disqualification of Barrichello) whose Toro Rosso-Ferrari engine burnt near the end of the race.

Neither Kimi Räikkönen, last year's champion and previous Australian race winner, nor his teammate Felipe Massa finished for Ferrari. Still, Kimi managed to get one point after the disqualification of Barrichello.
