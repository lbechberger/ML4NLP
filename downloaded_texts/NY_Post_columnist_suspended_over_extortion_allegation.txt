The New York Post has suspended gossip columnist Jared Paul Stern pending an FBI investigation into allegations that he tried to extort money from billionare Ron Burkle. Stern has denied the allegation. 

Stern contributes to Page Six, the New York Posts gossip and celebrity news section. The allegation first appeared in the New York Daily News, the Posts long-standing rival. The Daily News reported that, in a sting operation, Stern was videotaped asking Burkle for cash, in exchange for weeding out negative stories on Burkle. 

The Post said that it is cooperating with the federal investigation.
