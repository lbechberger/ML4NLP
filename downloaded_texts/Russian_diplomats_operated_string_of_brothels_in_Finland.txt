Diplomats at the Trade Representation of the Russian embassy have for a number of years operated at least 8 brothels in the Finnish capital.
The police investigation, which has just been completed, revealed that the diplomats were planning to expand their operation. They even planned to open a large hotel. 

About 100 Russian prostitutes worked at the brothels, and the diplomats are known to have pocketed more than $200,000. The police have not been able to interrogate the diplomats because of their diplomatic immunity. They left Finland soon after the police investigation began last spring.
