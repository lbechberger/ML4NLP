Taylor Mitchell, a Canadian folk singer, was attacked by two coyotes while hiking alone in Cape Breton Highlands National Park in Nova Scotia on Wednesday, officials said.

Another hiker nearby heard screams and contacted park rangers, where they found two coyotes attacking Mitchell. Rangers shot and injured one of the animals as it tried to flee.

Mitchell, aged 19, was airlifted to a Halifax hospital in critical condition. That evening, police found what they suspected to be the other coyote, and shot and killed it.

Mitchell died the following morning from bite wounds covering her entire body. The animals were described as "extremely aggressive" by park authorities. The dead coyote was tested to determine what caused the two to attack, as coyote attacks are very rare.
