Mark Zuckerberg, the 28-year-old founder of the social networking website Facebook, has married his girlfriend, Priscilla Chan. On Saturday, Zuckerberg married the 27-year-old Chan in the garden of his residence in Palo Alto, located in the US state of California. A spokesperson for Facebook described Chan's wedding ring as a "very simple ruby," which Zuckerberg designed.

The couple, who had been in a relationship for more than nine years, first met at Harvard University. Harvard is where Facebook was launched by Zuckerberg in 2004. Zuckerberg and Chan subsequently relocated to California, where Facebook is currently based. Late last week, Facebook was valued at over US$100 billion in its initial public offering on the NASDAQ stock exchange.

On Monday, the day Zuckerberg turned 28, Chan graduated from UCSF Medical Center. The guests, a list of under 100 people, initially thought that they would be attending a weekend celebration party for Chan's graduation but attended the wedding instead.

Zuckerberg has modified his relationship status on his Facebook page to 'married', a status change which has received tens of thousands of likes. The posting includes a photo of the newlyweds. Chan is wearing a white wedding dress decorated with lace, and Zuckerberg is dressed in a suit with a relaxed, loosely tied knot.
