Two train stations in Spain have been bombed. No-one was injured in the attacks on the Basque-area buildings, but there was some damage.

At 12:30 a.m. Saturday a small bomb described as being comprised of a mixture of explosives detonated in the ticket hall of the station in Berriz, bringing down the ceiling. This was followed by two homemade bombs being thrown at ticket machines at Amorebieta's train station at 2:30.

Police cordoned off Amorebieta's station as a precaution. No claim of responsibility has been made, but one report comments that the Basque regional government had intended to hold a referendum today before being blocked from doing so last month by the Constitutional Court of Spain.
