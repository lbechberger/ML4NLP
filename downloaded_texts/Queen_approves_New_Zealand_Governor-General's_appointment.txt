Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, Queen of New Zealand, on the recommendation of the Prime Minister of New Zealand, announced today that she had approved the appointment of Judge Anand Satyanand as the next Governor-General of New Zealand. He will take office on August 4.

Prime Minister Helen Clark says, "Judge Satyanand will bring many personal strengths to the role of Governor-General, including a broad knowledge of the workings of government and the law, as well as a deep appreciation of the different groups and communities which make up contemporary New Zealand."

National leader Dr Don Brash said, "Judge Satyanand has had a long period of public service in both judicial and quasi-judicial roles, and I congratulate him on his appointment... His experience makes him well suited to carry out the very important functions of Governor-General..."

Dame Silvia Cartwright will complete her term on 4 August 2006, and Judge Satyanand will be sworn in as Governor-General at "a date to be determined thereafter".

Anand Satyanand is of Indo-Fijian descent and a former New Zealand lawyer, judge and ombudsman. He will become the thirty-fifth representative of the Sovereign since 1840, and the first of Asian descent.
