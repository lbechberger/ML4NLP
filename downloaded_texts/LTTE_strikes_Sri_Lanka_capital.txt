The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) bombed the Sri Lankan capital of Colombo using two light aircraft on Friday. At least two are dead and another 50 injured. Civil defense in the city shut off electricity and lit up the sky with antiaircraft fire, according to Financial Times.

International observers are surprised at the attack, given the recent advances that the Sri Lanka army has made, driving the LTTE from their former territories.

"It is very significant that the rebels have carried out such an audacious attack when the government say that they are all but finished," opined BBC's Sinhala Editor, Priyath Liyanage. "It confirms what many of us already knew â€” the rebels may be experiencing reverses on the battle field but they are not simply just going to disappear." 

The conflict between the LTTE and the Sri Lanka government has been ongoing for over 25 years. The stated objective of the LTTE is to create a separate state known as Tamil Eelam for the Sri Lankan Tamil people.
