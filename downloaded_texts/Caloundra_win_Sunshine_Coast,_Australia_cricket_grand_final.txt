Caloundra has won the Sunshine Coast, Australia cricket premiership after the grand final was drawn. Caloundra batted first, setting Glasshouse 212 to win outright.

"We had alot to lose and they had alot to gain," Caloundra captain Rod Gibbs said.

Back in January Caloundra defeated Glasshouse in the limited overs final.

"It was a great game of cricket. Three days, 40 wickets (sic) and in the end two runs decided it," said Gibbs.

Caloundra resumed at six for fifty seven - a lead of 153. They only managed another fifty eight runs. This set Glasshouse aa target of 212 to win.

Going into the last over, Glasshouse needed four runs with one wicket in hand. They only managed a single. The match ended with a draw (not to be confused with a tie).
