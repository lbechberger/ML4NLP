Thomas Charles Damron, aged 22, was charged in the death of 18 year old Kathryn Sutherland, killed Saturday afternoon in a four-car crash Saturday afternoon near Romeo, Michigan.

Damron, arraigned Monday afternoon, was charged with operating a vehicle with the presence of drugs causing death, possession of marijuana, and negligent homicide. Preliminary investigations indicate that Damron crashed into the rear of another vehicle starting a chain reaction that ultimately led to still another car crossing into the westbound lane where it struck the victim's car.

Kathryn Sutherland died after she was airlifted to the University of Michigan Medical Center.
