Oscar-winner Angelina Jolie in a recent interview with the press acknowledged that playing slain journalist Daniel Pearl's wife in the new movie, A Mighty Heart, was a challenge in itself as she has to portray her strength amid the loss of her husband. Jolie said she wants to make the world understand this woman and her family.

Dan Futterman portrays Pearl and Jolie plays Mariane Pearl who was kidnapped and murdered in Pakistan in 2002. He was on a research assignment on Islamic militants in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001 attacks.

"We need to tell the story of Daniel Pearl and the reason we are making this film is because it's very important to have a dialogue between the two cultures," Jolie told an Indian daily on Thursday in Mumbai. Jolie arrived in India last month to begin work on filming portions of the movie there. 

Due to security concerns this movie could not be filmed in Karachi, Pakistan and its venue was shifted to western Indian cities of Pune and Mumbai. This movie is produced by Brad Pitt who is also Jolie's partner.

Jolie is most famous for her roles in Girl, Interrupted for which she won an Oscar, and Lara Croft: Tomb Raider, the 2001 blockbuster.
