The Greek national football team has defeated the Finnish equivalent 2-1 in a friendly football match.

Finland scored the first goal in the 66th minute when Alexei Eremenko managed to get the ball to uncovered player Jari Litmanen, who in turn put it past substitute goalkeeper Chrisostomos Michailidis. Just one minute later Greece equalised when Angelos Charisteas headed a free kick from Giorgos Karagounis into the Finnish goal.

In the 72nd minute Greece moved into the lead as Benfica midfielder Costas Katsouranis scored a distant but powerful shot, bouncing it beneath goalkeeper Peter Enckelman.

Both sides missed chances, with Finn Jonatan Johansson failing to capitalise on opportunities in the 7th and 4th minutes, causing Finland to lose out on having dominated the first half. Greek defender Sotiris Kyrgiakos kicked a shot over the bar shortly before half time.

Also competing in the four-nation tournament, held in Cyprus, are Poland and the Czech Republic. Greece are the current European champions, whilst Cyprus and Poland both qualified for Euro 2008, making Finland the only team in the line-up not to be competing in this year's European championships.
