A 78-year-old male cyclist died yesterday after being hit by a car in the Scottish capital Edinburgh. The accident occurred when the car hit the cyclist on the B800 road at approximately 1000 UTC yesterday.

The driver of the car, a black Mercedes-Benz B-Class vehicle, was not injured in the incident and has reportedly been cooperating with police as they investigate. During inquiries the road on which the accident occurred, which connects Kirkliston and South Queensferry, was closed.

In appealing to witnesses, Sergeant Ross Drummond of Police Scotland said the force has yet to track down any witnesses to the incident. "I am appealing for anyone who saw either the man on his bike — he was wearing every day clothing and was not in specialised cycling clothes — or the car around this time," Sergeant Drummond said.
