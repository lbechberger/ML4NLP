Goodluck Jonathan, the acting president of Nigeria, was formally sworn in today, several hours after president Umaru Yar'Adua died.

The oath of office was administered in the capital Abjua. According to the constitution, Jonathan will be the country's leader until next elections next April; he is also to nominate a vice president, who must be approved by the senate.

Jonathan already has been running the country when he became acting president since February, when Yar'Adua was hospitalised in Saudi Arabia for medical treatment.

After being sworn in, Jonathan made an address. "While this is a major burden on me, and indeed the entire nation, we must — in the midst of such great adversity — continue to gain our collective efforts towards upholding the values which our departed leader represented [...] One of the true tests will be that all votes count, and are counted, in our upcoming presidential election," he said.

Yar'Adua, aged 58, was buried earlier in the Katsina state; the government has declared a week of mourning.
