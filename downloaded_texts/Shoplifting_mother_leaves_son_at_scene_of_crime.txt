A woman who attempted to shoplift merchandise at a T.J. Maxx department store with another adult accomplice in Greenburgh, New York forgot one important item in her heist: her 8-month-old son.

While trying to shoplift, Suzette Gruber, aged 39, ran out of the store when she thought she would be caught, panicked, and left her son sitting in his stroller inside the store. Her accomplice also ran, and has yet to be identified.

"The mother panicked ... and just took off. It's sad," said Greenburgh police officer, Lt. Desmond Martin who also said that she left her cellular phone and purse behind.

Police say they will keep the child in protective custody while they investigate the incident. A man has claimed to be the father, presenting a birth certificate to police in an attempt to regain custody of the baby. He claims Gruber called him and told him to pick the boy up. Police are still working to confirm the man's claims. Reports say that he does not know where Gruber is.

Hidden inside the stroller's compartments were vases, teapots and utensils that were worth about US$185.

Gruber has been charged with theft before. In March of 2007, Gruber stole clothing from a mall and was charged with larceny and endangering the welfare of a child. According to reports, her then 2-week old son and 14-year old daughter were with her when she was arrested in March.

Gruber turned herself in to Greenburgh Police on Tuesday morning. She will be charged with abandonment of a child, a felony, and misdemeanor charges of petty larceny and endangering the welfare of a child, according to Police Chief John Kapica.
