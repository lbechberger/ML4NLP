On Wednesday, the Mississippi State Board of Medical Licensure chose to let Doctor Carroll Frazier Landrum keep his physician's license, following an investigation sparked by an anonymous complaint. Media reported the Mississippi doctor has been working out of his Toyota Camry for about two years, making house calls to see patients. 

The investigation, started earlier this year, reportedly centered around Dr. Landrum having no physical office thus possibly being unable to properly store patient records.

Volunteers are presently renovating the former post office in the town of Edwards, Mississippi, United States for the doctor to have an office. Estimations indicate the new office should be ready by early next month. Landrum, 89, closed his Edwards office two years ago. Landrum has routinely seen three or four patients per day since that time. Reportedly, illegal drug activity in the vicinity of his office placed him in danger. The doctor stated he was told his physical safety was in jeopardy.

Becoming tearful, Dr. Landrum told reporters he's glad he's been able to help so many people and "give them some hope and relief, and help them survive." Landrum has assured the medical board he will refresh his training with a medical record-keeping course. According to Landrum's attorneys, at first the board were unwilling to release their investigative records, although ultimately they did release some of the documents.
