Preacher, painter and prohibition activist Gene Amondson, best known for his runs as the U.S. presidential nominee for one faction of the Prohibition Party in 2004 and as the party's de facto nominee in 2008, died yesterday surrounded by his four children after falling into a coma following a stroke. He was 65 years old. 

Amondson was part of the Prohibition Party split in 2004 that led to two tickets. Although he received few votes, Amondson finished in third place in four Louisiana parishes, the best showing by a Prohibition Party candidate since 1960. The leader of the counter ticket, Earl Dodge, died in 2007 while campaigning for the party's 2008 nomination, leaving no opposition to Amondson as the party's leader.

He was strongly opposed to the sale of alcohol. As an activist, he filmed documentaries and held demonstrations supporting his cause. 

Amondson made many appearances on television, including two visits to the Oprah Winfrey Show as a painter and was interviewed by Jon Stewart on the Daily Show during his 2004 run.

He was also interviewed by Wikinews in June 2008, during his second presidential campaign.

Funeral services will be held on Saturday, July 25 at Amondson's home town of Vashon Island, Washington.
