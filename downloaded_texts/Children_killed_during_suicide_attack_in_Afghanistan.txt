As many as five children were killed Sunday during a suicide bomb attack on a military convoy in Mehtar Lam, Afghanistan.

The children were close to the convoy when it was hit. Police said two soldiers and two civilians were also killed, and several civilians injured. Local witnesses report that over a dozen were injured in the bombing.

The convoy was moving through Mehtar Lam, the capital of eastern Laghman province, when a car packed with explosives detonated near the Afghan army vehicles. Mehtar Lam is approximately 100 km east of Kabul.

The Afghan soldiers were traveling back to their base after assisting citizens affected by recent flooding, according to an Associated Press contact in the defence ministry.
