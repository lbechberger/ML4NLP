At 2 P.M. on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington D.C., approximately 400,000 people attended H.B.O.'s presentation of Barack Obama's inaugural kick off concert called "We are One". The concert featured many musicians including Beyonce, Stevie Wonder and U2. The show featured other high profile celebrities in between performances reading and reflecting on the significance of Barack's Inauguration on the 20th. Near the end, President-Elect Barack Obama went on the steps and gave a speech. 
Throughout most of the songs, several different large choirs provided back up vocals and harmony, as well as a full orchestra below the stage.
