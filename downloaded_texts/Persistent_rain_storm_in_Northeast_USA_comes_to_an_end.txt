On Saturday, the storm that blanketed the Northeast portion of the United States came to an end after eight days of consecutive rain. Many areas were flooded, while some areas had very little damage. States affected by the storm were New Jersey, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, parts of New York, and Connecticut. 

At least 10 people across the Northeast were reported dead as a result of the storm. Four more are missing.

Some areas of New Jersey had more than a foot of rainfall. Acting Governor Richard J. Codey declared a state of emergency on Friday as a first step toward applying for federal aid. The emergency was lifted on Saturday at 8:00 PM local time.
