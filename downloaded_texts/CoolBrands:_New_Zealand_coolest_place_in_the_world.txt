New Zealand has been voted the coolest place in the world by United Kingdom brand: CoolBrands.

Coolbrands is owned by a consultancy firm in the UK, called Superbrands. It started in 2001, CoolBrands is a way of telling how 'cool' a brand is. Superbrands defines "brands that have become extremely desirable among many style leaders and influencers. They have a magic about them, signifying that users have an exceptional sense of taste and style."

George Hickton, chief executive of Tourism New Zealand, said: "This win is a vindication of the recent work we've put in to the UK market, with the Chelsea Flower Show and our 100% Pure New Zealand advertising campaign ensuring New Zealand stays top of mind with potential travellers."

"It's very gratifying to see we are such a desirable destination, especially as this poll includes opinion leaders who can have an real influence on people's travel choices." says Mr Hickton. "this is the second award New Zealand has received in the UK this September, with Conde Nast Traveller magazine also voting New Zealand best destination this month."

Editor of CondÃ© Nast Traveler Magazine, Sarah Miller, called New Zealand a "point of authenticity." And professional nation brander, Wally Olin, said "New Zealand has been very, very clever. It has turned its disadvantages into advantages."

"Reaping the benefits of its recent marketing campaign, New Zealand is apparently the hottest place to be," said the London News.

650 brands were chosen by researchers which were then put before 23 judges and were made available for the public, of which 1,725 people participated in an online survey. Five percent of the original 650 made it to the finals, including Morocco, Maldive and Australia.

New Zealand receives most of its tourists from Australia, closely followed by the UK.

The top ten destinations included:
* New Zealand
* Morocco
* Fiji
* Prague
* Australia
* Maldives
