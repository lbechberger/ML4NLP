The World Health Organization and United Nations Children's Fund announce that the global immunization drive has cut measles deaths by nearly half between 1999 and 2004. The number of deaths fell from 871,000 in 1999 to an estimated 454,000 in 2004 (the most recent year for which data is available). They report the reduction is as a result of "major national immunization activities and better access to routine childhood immunization".
