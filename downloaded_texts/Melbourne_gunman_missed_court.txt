The gunman involved in the Melbourne shooting on Monday has missed court because of a reported injury in his arm and needed surgery in the St Vincent's Hospital. He is under police guard and was remanded in custody until October 10. 31 year-old Christopher Wayne Hudson handed himself in to the police peacefully late yesterday afternoon. 

On Monday morning one person, Brendan Keilar, was killed and two wounded in the shooting and much of the centre of Melbourne was sealed off as police searched for the gunman. 

Police would not discuss how Hudson received the injury but said the injury happened before his arrest. His lawyer, Patrick Dwyer, also refused to comment on the speculation that it was self-inflicted.
