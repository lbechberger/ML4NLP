The rapper, Lil' Kim, also known as Kimberly Jones, was sentenced to one year and one day in prison and ordered to pay a $50,000 fine after lying to a grand jury. Jones had been questioned about the involvement of several of her acquaintances in a gunfight. Jones had testified before a grand jury that she did not see her manager the day of the altercation and claimed that she did not recognize a photo of one of her associates. Jones also said that she took "complete blame" for the same perjury committed by her assistant, Monique Dopwell.

The fight broke out in front of the "Hot 97" radio station in New York. Jones' entourage came across the rival rap group, Capone-N-Noreaga, and confronted the group about the song, "Bang, Bang", which contained an insult to Jones.
