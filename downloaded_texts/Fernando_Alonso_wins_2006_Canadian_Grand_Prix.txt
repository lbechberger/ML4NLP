For the first time in his career, Fernando Alonso won the FIA Formula-1 Canadian Grand Prix on the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve on an island in the St. Lawrence River.

Alonso once again had a great race, driving in the lead for the most of the race. Michael Schumacher started fifth, but finished before Kimi Raikkonen, who made a crucial mistake on the last lap. Alonso teammate Giancarlo Fisicella finished on the back of Raikkonen, because of a bad start from the second place and a "drive through pit-lane" penalty imposed by a false start.

Canadian fans were absolutely upset when Jacque Villeneuve crashed on the dying laps of the race, causing a safety car to close the gap between Raikkonen and Schumacher.
