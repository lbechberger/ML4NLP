A house fire in Bristol, England has caused the deaths of two brothers, identified as Charlie, aged five, and seven-year-old Mackenzie. Emergency services were called to the scene in the early hours of Saturday morning.

The bodies were discovered by firemen, at the scene in the suburb of Bradley Stoke around 0630 UTC. Police and ambulance services were also in attendance. Prior to their arrival, three other children and two adults escaped from the building in Merryweather Close through windows.

Speaking on behalf of Avon Fire and Rescue Service, manager William Roberts explained: "When crews arrived, the fire was fully developed and engulfing the first floor and roof space. Sadly, when crews entered the building they found the children. They were both upstairs, one in back bedroom, one in front. It is a sad day for the Bradley Stoke community and Avon fire. The ceiling has fallen in on itself and on top of our evidence. This is probably the worst fire I've seen in my 32 years."

According to Roberts, smoke alarms were in the building, however the damage was "so extensive" that it is uncertain as to whether or not they were functioning correctly. "A full investigation has been launched by the police and fire investigators. No formal identification has yet taken place," Avon and Somerset Constabulary's Detective Sergeant Simon Chubb stated.
