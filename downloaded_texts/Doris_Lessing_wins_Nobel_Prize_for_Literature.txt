After lots of speculations and speculative London betting on the outcome it has been announced that British author Doris Lessing ("The Golden Notebook", 1962) is the winner of the 2007 Nobel Prize for Literature. 

At the International Book Fair at Frankfurt, Germany, which is currently underway, this decision has met with general approval, as a decision awarding the literary work of an author well established beyond her native country, rather than a political statement. The reason given for giving the prestigious award to Doris Lessing was to honour "that epicist of the female experience, who with skepticism, fire and visionary power has subjected a divided civilisation to scrutiny". 

Lessing herself, who will turn 88 on October 22, has been named a potential candidate over the last 30 years - so long in fact, that she herself once exclaimed: "I'll never get it". Finally, on December 10, 2007, the Nobel Prize including 10 million Swedish Kronor (â‚¬1.1 million) will be awarded to her in Stockholm, Sweden.
