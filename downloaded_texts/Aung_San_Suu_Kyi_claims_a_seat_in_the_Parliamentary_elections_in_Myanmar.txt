Nobel Peace Prize winner and activist Aung San Suu Kyi claims to have won an estimated 99% of votes in the Kawhmu constituency in Myanmar's parliamentary elections yesterday.

The leader of National League for Democracy, she spent most of the past 22 years under Junta rule as a political prisoner. The victory claim was displayed by her party on a digital signboard in Yangon. Although Suu Kyi expressed concern at the election's fairness, the 66 year old eventually contested Kawhmu, a rural constituency located two hours from Yangon. 

Unofficially the NLD claimed victory in thirteen constituencies across the country but official tallies are yet to be released. Myanmar has been under military rule for the past 49 years. NLD claimed it was on its way to win 44 of 45 seats in the by-elections. Widespread incidents of irregularities were reported during polling against which NLD spokesman Nyan Win said he would write to the Union Election Commission.

Known as The Lady, Suu Kyi is the daughter of independence fighter Aung San. Her supporters waited in crowds for hours just to get a glimpse of her as she campaigned for her first ever elections.
