According to the United States Geological Survey (USGS), a preliminary magnitude 6.4 earthquake has struck off the coast of Oregon in the United States.

The quake struck at 01:37 (UTC) and its epicenter was located 242 kilometers (151 miles) west, northwest of Barview. It registered at a depth of 10 k.m. (6.2 miles).

So far there are no reports of damage, injuries or deaths and no tsunami warning has been issued, but small waves could be locally generated by any possible landslides.

"The magnitude is such that a tsunami is not expected. However, in coastal areas of intense shaking, locally generated tsunamis can be triggered by underwater landslides," said the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Pacific Tsunami Warning Center in a statement on its website. No further messages will be generated it adds.

Firefighters in Bandon report that they didn't even feel the tremor and police say that no one has yet called to report any quake related incidents. Bandon is also located within 150 miles of the quake's epicenter.
