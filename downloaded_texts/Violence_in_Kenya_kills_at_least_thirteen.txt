Violence in Kenya has resulted in thirteen deaths. The militia raid is the first attack since a power-sharing agreement was reached last week. The incident is believed to have stemmed from a land dispute. All Africa reports that some of the victims were burned alive, while others were decapitated or shot.

A witness told The Nation, "I hid behind a huge rock near my house, otherwise I would be dead by now." Police have stated that at least six of the thirteen victims were children. It has also been reported that four of the victims were relatives of Fredrick Mbuya, a police reservist.

The attack took place in Embaski Village in the Rift Valley area of Kenya. The Rift Valley, which is almost 500 km from Nairobi, has been the scene of other violent incidents in the last few months.
