Large rallies were held in cities around the globe yesterday, to call on governments to take greater action against climate change. 

The internationally-coordinated actions, dubbed 'Walk Against Warming', aimed to raise awareness of the urgent need for something to be done about human-caused climate change, said organisers. 

The protests were timed to precede the international talks about climate change that are to be held in Kenya, starting next week.

In London (UK), 22,000 protesters gathered in Trafalgar Square, while in Sydney (Australia) there were 50,000.
