The Gippsland Football League is the only major Australian rules football competition in the Gippsland region according to the Victorian Country Football League.

At the league's annual general meeting in December, it changed its name from the West Gippsland Latrobe Football League. At the same meeting, Wonthaggi joined the GL after dominating the Alberton Football League during the past decade. The Power made five consecutive Alberton Grand Finals winning three, losing only to Yarram (2007) and Stony Creek (2009).

Wonthaggi Power Football Club is a result of a merger between Wonthaggi Blues, a former Gippsland FL team, and Wonthaggi Rovers, an Alberton FL team. In February, the Gippsland Football League announced that Wonthaggi would be changing their uniforms, because their original one was similar to that of Warragul.

In their round one game, Wonthaggi won by one point at the Wonthaggi Recreation Reserve. 

Around the grounds, Traralgon defeated Moe by 35 points, Maffra defeated Drouin by 37 points and Morwell defeated Warragul 35 points. Sale had the bye.
