The president of Romania, Traian Băsescu, continues to be the most popular politician in the country, according to a survey by the Romanian Centre for Urban Resources (CURS). The survey shows that 63% of those interviewed have a good or very good opinion of the president. Even though this result is better than the 60% approval rating he received in October 2005, it is lower than the 71% approval he obtained in June 2005.

The second-most popular major politician is the opposition leader and head of the Social Democratic Party, Mircea Geoană, who has an approval rating of 47%. He is trailed by the Prime Minister, Călin Popescu-Tăriceanu, with 44%. Gigi Becali, the leader of the New Generation Party, recorded the largest increase in popularity, with an approval rating of 30%, in comparison to the 20% he achieved in October 2005.

The survey also looked at Romanians' opinions towards the major political parties. 42% of the respondents stated that they would vote for the governing Justice and Truth Alliance, made up of the National Liberal Party and the Democratic Party. 25% stated that they would vote for the Social Democratic Party, while the right-wing Greater Romania Party would receive 14% of the vote. Both of these parties recorded decreases in popularity. On the other hand, the New Generation Party and the National Initiative Party gained in popularity, with the New Generation Party attracting 4% of potential votes.

44% of the people interviewed believe that Romania will join the European Union in January 2007, as scheduled, while 18% think that the safeguard clause will be activated, postponing accession until 2008.
