The Anglican Church in South Australia has agreed to pay up to AU$4 million to 36 victims of alleged paedophile Robert Brandenberg.

Brandenberg, a priest and former Church of England Boys Society leader, committed suicide in 1999, on the same day he was to face court on child sex offence charges.

Peter Humphries, lawyer for the victims, said the deal was the result of three years of negotiations with the church. "Two thirds of the batch of claims have been assessed and we're satisfied that the church has made sensible offers – we'll be recommending settlement in next day or so," he said.

Humphries said he has recommended most of the victims settle with the church. "For those clients who accept offers that will be it," he said.

24 victims have agreed to accept the church’s offer and have settled their claims. The remaining 12 are expected to be finalised soon.
