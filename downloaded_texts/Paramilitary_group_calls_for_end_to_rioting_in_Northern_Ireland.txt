The Ulster Defence Association (UDA) has called on its members to "avoid any confrontation on the streets and steer away from any acts of violence". This statement from the UDA comes after the third consecutive night of Loyalist violence in Belfast. The rioting has so far left 60 police officers injured and resulted in 63 arrests. Rioters blocked roads, hijacked and torched vehicles, and attacked police.

Police Chief Constable Hugh Orde has said that he believes the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) and the UDA are behind the violence, which broke out after the re-routing of an Orange Order parade.

Northern Ireland Secretary Peter Hain is expected to announce shortly that the UVF ceasefire, announced in 1994, has come to an end.
