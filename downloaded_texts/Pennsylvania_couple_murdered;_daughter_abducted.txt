Michael and Cathryn Borden, a couple, both 50 years old, were found shot to death in Lititz, Pennsylvania shortly after 8 AM EST (1300 UTC). Their 9 year old son, David, had fled to a neighbor's house and called emergency assistance (911). The couple's younger daughter, Kara Beth Borden, age 14, was reported missing. Her older sister was found in the home unharmed.

Police believe that the abductor was 18-year-old David G. Ludwig. Neighbor Stephanie Mannon said Ludwig had been secretly dating Kara, without the approval of Kara's parents. "It wasn't because he was a shady character," stated Mannon, "because he wasn't."

An Amber alert was issued for Borden, with her description stated as: white female, age 14, 5'1", 100 pounds, brown hair with blonde highlights. She was last seen wearing a black sweat shirt with "Pillar" across the front, blue jeans and black sneakers.
