Tampa Bay leads series 2-1. (Best of Seven)



After losing the playoff opener, the Tampa Bay Lightning have won two straight, to take the series lead, two games to one. Both teams did very well both on the attack and in their own zone at the St. Pete Times Forum in Tampa, Florida Monday night. 

Vincent Lecavalier would be the first to score midway through the first period, on a sharp angle to put the Lightning up 1-0. Johan Holmqvist would shutout the Devils though the entire first period but Martin Brodeur would return the favor as he would shutout the Lightning throughout the second period. The Devils did rebound from the 1-0 score as John Madden would score in the dying seconds of the second period to make the game 1-1. In the third period, as it was tied 1-1, Brad Richards would score very early on and put the Lightning up, yet again, at 2-1. Shortly after the Brad Richards goal, the Devils would counter with a goal of their own as Zach Parise scored to tie the game once more at 2-2. In the end Tampa Bay would be victorious as Vaclav Prospal scored the game winner late in the third. 

Jersey goaltender Martin Brodeur needs to play better if he wants his team to advance, as he has given up a unusually high three goals in all three games of the series. The next game in the series is scheduled for Wednesday, April 18th, at 7:00 PM EST in Tampa Bay.
