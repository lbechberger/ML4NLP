US professional pool player Wade Crane has died after a one-car accident in Tennessee, USA. He was 66 years old. Crane's Volkswagen crossed three lanes of traffic into the concrete retaining wall, then bounced back across five more lanes of traffic into another retaining wall.

It is believed that Crane suffered from an undiagnosed medical condition. News of the crash was broken by The Knoxville News Sentinel.

Crane was a former world champion of both 9-ball and 8-ball pool. A self-taught player, for 21 years he was the only person in pool history to shoot a perfect score in the finals of a major tournament. 

Fellow pool players including Nick Varner, Johnny Archer, and Shannon Daulton paid tribute to Crane.
