Days after the Iranian administration announced their first successful enrichment of uranium, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has made threatening comments against the Israeli government at a conference to discuss Palestine.

During the three day conference on Friday, Ahmadinejad is reported to have commented on Israelâ€™s reported threat to the Middle East and suggested that the Israeli government was "heading toward annihilation," and that it will soon be liberated. 

Iran is known to be a supporter of Palestine, and has previously offered an unknown amount of money to the Palestinian Authority to make up for the loss of Western donations since Hamas won the Palestinian legislative elections in 2006.
