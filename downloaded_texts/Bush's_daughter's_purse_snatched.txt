Barbara Bush, daughter of U.S. President George W. Bush had her purse stolen while on a two-week trip in Argentina.

Unnamed law enforcement officials told news agencies that the 24-year old Miss Bush was "not in the immediate proximity" of her purse when it was stolen. Her cell phone was among the items stolen. 

According to the source, "at no point were the protectees out of visual contact and at no point was there any risk of harm."

Miss Bush was having dinner in the San Telmo neighborhood of Buenos Aires during her first night there when the incident occurred. According to the reports, Secret Service agents guarding Miss Bush failed to notice the theft. 

According to additional unnamed law enforcement sources, an agent member of Miss Bush's advance party Secret Service was badly beaten during an "altercation" on his personal time, which the agent reported as an attempted mugging. The agent's condition is fine. 

A Bush administration official confirmed that "a theft incident" involving Barbara Bush had occurred, but declined details. The Secret Service, which is charged with the protecting the First Family's personal security, declined comment, as did the White House, and the First Lady's office. 

There have been recent reports that Miss Bush has been living and working in Panama as an intern for UNICEF.
