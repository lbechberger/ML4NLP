Ben Roethlisberger, starting quarterback for the National Football League's Pittsburgh Steelers, has been seriously injured in a motorcycle accident Monday at roughly 11:30 a.m. EDT. Early reports indicate he has broken his nose and jaw, but the full extent of his injuries remain unknown. Roethlisberger has already undergone surgery for his nose and mouth. He was riding without a helmet on Second Avenue near the intersection of 10th Street in downtown Pittsburgh when he collided with a silver Chrysler New Yorker, reportedly striking the windshield with his head.

Backup quarterback Charlie Batch was at the emergency room at Mercy Hospital today, but was unavailable for comment. Steelers head coach Bill Cowher has talked to Ben in the past about riding without a helmet, and retired Steelers quarterback Terry Bradshaw has spoken out strongly against the habit of riding without a helmet in the past.

A press conference held around 10:30 p.m. confirmed that Roethlisberger successfully underwent seven hours of surgery, and suffered no serious injuries in the initial accident apart from the broken nose and jaw. Initial reports of knee injuries were overstated. Actual knee injuries were limited to road rash, and do not extend to joint injuries.
