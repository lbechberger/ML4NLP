British ventriloquist Ray Alan has died at the age of 79. Alan was best known for his sketches with his puppet, Lord Charles. His death was announced by his agent. Alan died in his sleep. 
 
Alan received the majority of his fame in the 1950s and 60’s appearing on several children’s television shows including Tich and Quackers and also as a guest artist on the series The Good Old Days. Later in his career he worked as an entertainer on the QE2 Cruise ship. He stopped work in 2008 due to ill health.
 
Peter Pritchard, Alan’s agent for 30 years, released a statement saying that Alan “passed away very suddenly”. He spoke about Alan’s career saying that “Technically he was regarded as Britain’s top ventriloquist. You just couldn’t see his mouth moving. He was tremendously well-liked in the business and has been in the entertainment business his whole life”.

Alan spoke to the BBC in 2006 speaking about his puppet. He said “I'm not one of those ventriloquists who thinks he's real. When I finish my work I put it back in the tool box and I don't take it out again until the next job.”
