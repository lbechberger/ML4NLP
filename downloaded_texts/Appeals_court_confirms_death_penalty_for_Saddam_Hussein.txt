According to the Tribunal spokesman Raed Jouhi, the Iraqi High Tribunal's appeals court in Baghdad confirms the sentence of death against the former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, after a month and a half of trial review. 

According to the CNN, no sentence has been notified to Saddam Hussein yet.

On November 5, Hussein was sentenced to death for his role in the Dujail massacre in 1982, in which 148 Shiites died.

According to Iraqi laws, Hussein would be hanged within 30 days, and there is no chance of pardon.
