On Sunday, United States Senator Joseph Lieberman speaking on the CBS program, Face the Nation has gone on record stating that the United States should seriously consider a military strike against Iran because of their involvement with the Iraqi insurgency.



With predictions that the nuclear program of Iran will have created a nuclear weapon within three years, senior American military officers claim to have a plan to strike and they support President George W. Bush's stated policy to do whatever it takes to stop Iran's nuclear program.
