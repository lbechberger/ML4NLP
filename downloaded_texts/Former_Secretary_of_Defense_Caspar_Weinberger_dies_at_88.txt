Former United States Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger has died in the state of Maine today at the age of 88. Weinberger was hospitalized for pneumonia and having a high fever shortly before his death.

Weinberger served under Ronald Reagan's administration during the 1980's, in which he pushed for more defense programs in the United States military, including the Strategic Defense Initiative space defense program. He was also indicted on felony counts of lying to the independent counsel investigating the Iran-Contra Affair, but was pardoned by then-President George H. W. Bush days before he was to go on trial..

Weinberger also was the publisher and chairman of Forbes Magazine in the early 1990's. He authored a book, Fighting for Peace, and co-authored another with Peter Schweizer, entitled The Next War. Both books are based on the effects of the Cold War.

Weinberger's funeral will be conducted at the Arlington National Cemetery.
