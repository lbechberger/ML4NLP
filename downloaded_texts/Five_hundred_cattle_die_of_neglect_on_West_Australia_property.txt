RSPCA inspectors found about 500 cattle dead on a remote station in Western Australia. Water is being trucked in to care for another 2500 cattle on Windidda station, east of Wilun, which is leased to an Aboriginal corporation.

State Agriculture Minister Kim Chance says the propery was found abandoned and only two of the property's 13 watering stations were working.

"The lease is owned by an aboriginal corporation (but) the precise of identity of the corporation is somewhat obscure," Mr Chance said.

WA RSPCA spokesperson Kelly Oversby said they made the shocking discovery after an anonymous tip-off. 

"Experienced inspectors have told us it is the worst case of animal cruelty they have ever seen," Ms Overby said.

"As well as the cattle, brumbies, camels, dogs and kangaroos have all perished."
