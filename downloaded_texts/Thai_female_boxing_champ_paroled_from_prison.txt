Female boxing champion Samson Sor Siriporn was released on parole from prison Pathum Thani, Thailand today, after serving five years of a seven-year term on a drug conviction. She will live at the residence of the director of the Women's Rehabilitation Center.

The 24-year-old Thai woman won the WBC world flyweight title in a special match in prison in April, defeating Ayaka Miyano of Japan, and creating a media sensation. She is due to defend her title next month.

"Thanks for those who supported a convict like me," Siriporn was quoted as saying at a press conference. "Some may not agree but I don't care. I am happy that there are people willing to support me. I like to thank all the officials as well."
