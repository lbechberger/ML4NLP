The British Education Secretary, Ruth Kelly, announced during the week that junk food is to be banned from schools in England from September 1st 2006. Items such as crisps, sweets, chocolate bars and chewing gum are expected to be among the items banned.

Junk foods are classified as those high in fat, salt or sugar. Recently the British government committed Â£280m to improving school food over the next three years. That followed a campaign by celebrity chef, Jamie Oliver, to improve school food.

The action by the British government to ban junk food has already sparked debate in Ireland whether they should follow suit.
