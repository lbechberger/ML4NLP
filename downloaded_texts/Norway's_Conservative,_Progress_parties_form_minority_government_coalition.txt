Following three weeks of talks, the leader of HÃ¸yre, Norway's Conservative Party, Erna Solberg announced today that the Conservatives will form a minority government in a right-wing coalition with the Progress Party. The coalition will be the first time the Progress Party have been in power in the executive branch.

The coalition government plans to change policy on immigration and asylum, reduce inheritance tax, and reform provision of healthcare and pensions. The parties also agreed to not allow drilling for oil on Jan Mayen Island or in the Lofoten archipelago. The Norwegian Oil and Gas Association said the decision was "disappointing and undemocratic".

Solberg said that she intends to continue working with other parties. The new government is due to take office on October 18. Solberg will replace the current Labor Party Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg.
