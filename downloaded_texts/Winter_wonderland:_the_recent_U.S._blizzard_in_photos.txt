A recent blizzard that paralyzed parts of the U.S. East Coast Sunday has left many areas buried under feet of snow. When all was said and done, the storm, a severe nor'easter, had affected everywhere from North Carolina to New England and Nova Scotia in Canada. Among its effects were at least five fatalities, as well as large-scale traffic delays. 

The storm originated in the Gulf of Mexico, as nor'easters usually do, and grew to be a powerful cyclone as it moved northeastward. Often described as the worst winter storm to strike the area in years, Long Island bore the brunt of the blizzard. There, crippling snow, amounting to as much as 24 inches, heavily disrupted travel. Cities like Philadelphia had one of their worst storms in recorded history. 

Hundreds of thousands of residents were without power as the storm swept across the region. Some areas declared snow emergencies, and strongly encouraged people not to travel and to remain at home. In Virginia, the National Guard rescued several hundred motorists who became stranded due to the heavy snows. A twenty-mile traffic backup on Interstate 81 was also reported.
