Thai authorities are searching for a man wearing a yellow , recorded on video leaving a backpack shortly before a pipe-bomb exploded two days ago near Erawan Hindu Shrine, Bangkok. 

The shrine is a popular attraction in Thailand's capital, where at least 20 people, including at least eight foreigners, are reported dead with upwards of 100 injured. 

The blast occurred at approximately 7pm on Monday local time (1200 UTC), when central Bangkok was flooded with pedestrian activity. Authorities say the suspect may have already left Thailand and was assisted by others.

Following months of political unrest, since the explosion the Thai baht hit a six year low. 

According to Defence Minister Prawit Wonguwan speaking to Reuters, the bombing was a deliberate attack on the country's economy and tourism industry. 

Military authorities said Muslim insurgents from the country's southern provinces are unlikely to be behind the attack.
