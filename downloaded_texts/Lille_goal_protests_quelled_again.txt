Protests have continued after Manchester United defeated Lille in the Champions League round of 16. A free kick by Ryan Giggs in the second half of the game caused great controversy, as Lille was setting up their wall as the ball went into the back of the net. Lille players nearly walked off the pitch at the time, but they were goaded back onto the field, and the game ended 1 - 0 for Manchester United.

Lille made one protest to UEFA, asking for a replay of the match, but the appeal was turned down, and the decision of referee Eric Braamhaar stood for the time. Lille has made a second protest, claiming a technical error on the referee's part, as the kick was taken without the whistle being blown. UEFA has rejected their appeal again, saying no proof of a technical error has been presented. Lille will have 3 days after receiving notice from UEFA to lodge another appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, or the claim will be dismissed in full.

The second leg game between United and Lille will take place next Wednesday at Old Trafford.
