Jeremy Roenick scored his 12th of the season late in the first period, which put the Sharks on the board and in the lead. Minnesota answered back 49 seconds into the second, when Stephane Veilleux put a puck past Evgeni Nabokov. Curtis Brown put the Sharks back in the lead a few minutes later. Marian Gaborik scored a power play goal early in the third, tying the score. Joe Pavelski scored to put San Jose ahead with 2:02 left in regulation. Minnesota was able to re-tie the score when Gaborik scored his second of the night with just 29 seconds left in regulation to force overtime and eventually a shootout. Pavelski and Brent Burns each scored for their respective teams, which tied the shootout in the first round. Roenick scored the deciding shootout goal in the third round, which gave the Sharks their 13th win in 14 games.

Kurtis Foster was taken off the ice in a stretcher in the second period, after being pushed from behind, losing his balance, and crashing into the boards during a race for the puck in a touch-icing situation. Foster has surgery Thursday to repair damage to a broken leg, and will miss the rest of the 2007-08 season, including the playoffs.
