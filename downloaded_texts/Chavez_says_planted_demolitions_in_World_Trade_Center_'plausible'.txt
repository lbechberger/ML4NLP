Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez stated the U.S. government may have planned the September 11, 2001 attacks. He said the attacks have been used to justify U.S. "aggression" throughout the Middle East and also that 9/11 conspiracy theories are plausible.

Chavez said in a speech Tuesday, "The hypothesis is not absurd ... that those towers could have been dynamited." He also said "A building never collapses like that, unless it's with an implosion."

The U.S. government has maintained that Al-Qaeda orchestrated the attacks under the leadership of Osama bin Laden.
