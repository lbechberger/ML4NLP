Bayern Munich and Bolton Wanderers drew 2-2 today.

Bolton Wanderers opened the scoring after only eight minutes when Ricardo Gardner scored on a deflected shot. After taking 15 minutes to settle in, Bayern Munich started to attack more frequently and it paid dividends after 30 minutes when Lukas Podolski equalized. Early in the 2nd half Bayern Munich took the lead when Podolski got his 2nd goal of the game. However, with 8 minutes left, Bolton equalized which earned Bolton's 2nd point in the group stage while Bayern lead Group F with 4 points. If Bayern Munich wins their next UEFA Cup match, they are all but assured their place in the next round.
