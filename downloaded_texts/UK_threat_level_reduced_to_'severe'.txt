The United Kingdom's Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre (JTAC), a division of the security agency MI5, has now reduced the United Kingdom threat level from 'critical' to 'severe'.

Since the terrorist attacks in London and Glasgow the threat level in the United Kingdom was at 'critical' meaning an "attack was imminent", however the Home Secretary, Jacqui Smith, today announced the level was to be reduced.

She said, "There is no intelligence to suggest that an attack is expected imminently. However, the reduction of the threat level to severe does not mean the overall threat has gone away."

The MI5 website stated, "This means that future terrorist attacks are still highly likely, but no longer thought to be imminent. The decision has been made by JTAC based on a review of the latest intelligence."

This reduction comes after eight arrests were made in connection to the terror attacks.
