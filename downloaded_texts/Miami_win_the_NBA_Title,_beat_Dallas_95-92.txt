The Miami Heat won their first NBA Title in franchise history Tuesday beating the Dallas Mavericks 95-92. Dallas initially led the series 2-0. Miami then went on to a surprising turnaround and won four straight to win the title.



Alonzo Mourning, Gary Payton, and Dwyane Wade all won their first NBA Title. Pat Riley last won the title 18 years ago and Shaquille O'Neal last won the title 4 years ago. Of the most active NBA players, O'Neal has four NBA Titles, the second most NBA Titles of active NBA players.

With 9.1 seconds left, Wade, who scored 36 points this game, missed two free throws giving Dallas one final chance to tie the game. A three-point field goal attempt by Dallas' Jason Terry hit the rim but failed to fall into the basket.

A championship parade is scheduled for 2 P.M. on Friday in downtown Miami, Florida.
