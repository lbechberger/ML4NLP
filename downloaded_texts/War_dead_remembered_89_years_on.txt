Millions of people in the United Kingdom, Canada and many other Commonwealth countries observed two minutes silence in memory of the millions who died fighting for their countries during the First World War which ended exactly 89 years ago today.

The U.K. ceremony was held in Whitehall, London where wreaths were laid by the Queen, Duke of Edinburgh and many others including Prince William for the first time. Former Prime Minister Tony Blair and representatives from the Army, Navy and the Royal Air Force amongst others participated in the service which was watched by many thousands across the world.

Britain's oldest known veteran, Henry Allingham aged 111 years old, laid a wreath in France as part of the international ceremonies which are also taking place in Iraq, Afghanistan and Sri Lanka. The two minutes silence at the U.K. ceremony was marked by the firing of a field gun on Horse Guards Parade to begin and end the silence, followed by Royal Marines buglers, playing the Last Post.
