Two companies have pleaded guilty to breaching health and safety laws after the stage of The Alexandra Theatre in Birmingham, United Kingdom collapsed resulting in injuries ranging from bruises to bone fractures in 30 people.

The two companies, Sing Along Productions and Clear Channel, said that the collapse occurred after a communications breakdown between them.

During the production of Sing-Along-A-Sound-of-Music, members of the audience in costume had climbed onto the stage to participate in a song when the stage fell into the orchestra pit 20 feet below.

The case has been sent to Birmingham Crown Court for sentencing. The case was brought to Birmingham Magistrates Court by Birmingham City Council under health and safety legislation.
