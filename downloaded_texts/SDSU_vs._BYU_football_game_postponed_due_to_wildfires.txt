The San Diego State University (SDSU) and Brigham Young University (BYU) football game, originally scheduled for October 27, 2007 in San Diego, has been postponed until December 1. Qualcomm Stadium, home of the SDSU Aztecs, is currently housing 12,000 evacuees from the Southern California wildfires.

In addition to the housing of evacuees at the stadium, the decision to postpone the game was made for several other reasons. Federal and state declarations of a state of emergency; air quality; transportation considerations; closure of SDSU; student-athlete well-being; fan safety; and competitive equity, all played a role. Mountain West Conference commissioner Craig Thompson said, "There is a far greater priority than sporting events in the San Diego area at this time. The focus should be on emergency response and resources, and getting the community back on its feet. Our thoughts are with our colleagues at San Diego State University, as well as everyone who has been affected by this disaster."
