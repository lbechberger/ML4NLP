Fernando Alonso became the first Spaniard to win the FIA Formula-1 Spanish Grand Prix. Unlike in the previous race, this time, Michael Schumacher placed third after the qualification on Saturday. Giancarlo Fisicella, Alonso's teammate, started second, thus completing the front row by Renault. Two Ferrari cars occupied the second row.

In the race, which took place in Barcelona, Montmello circuit de Catalunya, Schumacher struck hard to overtake Renault drivers, but finished with this goal half done. Unable to compete with Alonso's speed, he easily overtook Fisico after the first pit stop.

As said by the winner about his own speed, he "controlled the second part of the race" and slowed down because of the huge gap between him and his closest competitor, Michael Schumacher.

Although he set the fastest lap in the race, this time, Felipe Massa did not have enough pace to overtake Fisicella, thus completing the race on the fourth place. Kimi Räikkönen did not struggle as much with the other drivers as he did with his own car and finished fifth. All the other competitors, except for the sixth place Jenson Button, finished with a gap more than a lap.

In the drivers' championship, Fernando Alonso won back 2 points from Michael Schumacher and now has a 15-point lead.
