Canucks lead series 1-0. (Best of Seven)


The Vancouver Canucks came out on top after the sixth longest game in NHL Playoff history. The final goal came after a scoring opportunity that was able to find the back of the net, finally, after Dallas Stars goaltender Marty Turco kept the net empty for over 90 minutes. Henrik Sedin connected on a pass from brother, Daniel Sedin, which unleashed a celebration from the remaining crowd at General Motors Place in Vancouver.

Vancouver's goalie, Roberto Luongo had a very successful performance as he stopped a total of 72 shots to keep the Canucks in the game for as long as it lasted. On the other hand, the Stars' Turco performed fairly well, fending off 48 shots, but will likely fall to criticism as he has been unable, at least in previous seasons, to continue his all star season performances with playoff success.

The game was the longest ever in Vancouver Canucks' history.

Vancouver looks to extend its 1-0 series lead over the Dallas Stars after the first game as they continue the series in Vancouver on Friday at 6:00pm (PDT). Vancouver eventually won the series 4-3.
