Iraq's Interior Ministry has said that the leader of the insurgent group, the Mujahideen Shura Council, Abu Omar al-Baghdadi has been killed by the United States military and Iraqi Forces and that his remains have been identified. He is said to have been killed during the night on Wednesday, one day after reports said that the leader of Al-Qaeda in Iraq, Abu Ayyub al-Masri was killed.

"Abu Omar al-Baghdadi was killed north of Baghdad by Iraqi and American forces. He died as a result of wounds sustained in clashes. The Interior Ministry has his body to carry out further checks," said Maj. Gen. Hussein Kamal, Iraq's Deputy Interior Minister. State TV in Iraq has also aired footage of a body that is believed to be that of al-Baghdadi.

The U.S. military has not commented on the claim by the Interior Ministry.

There are conflicting reports as to whether or not al-Baghdadi was killed during a battle in Taji, Iraq on Tuesday. Reports began to surface Tuesday that al-Masri was killed during that battle, but so far neither the Iraqi government or the U.S. military have confirmed, or denied the reports.

Despite the claim, on Tuesday the Islamic State of Iraq denied that al-Masri was dead posting a message on a militant website saying, "The Islamic State of Iraq reassures the Ummah on the safety of Sheikh Abu Hamza al-Muhajir, may God protect him, and that he is still fighting the enemies of God."
