An estimated 200,000 iPhones were sold in the US in the first few days of release. Over 400 of those have been put up for sale on the online auction site eBay, by individuals hoping to profit from the demand.

Trip Chowdhry, an analyst with San Francisco-based Global Equities, estimated Apple stores sold about 128,000 on the first day, while AT&amp;T stores sold about 72,000.

The pre-release frenzy that preceded the coming of the iPhone was climaxed by hundreds of people camping outside many Apple stores across the United States.

The iPhone acts as a mobile phone, MP3 player, and wireless web browser/email client.
