American airline, Alaska Airlines have announced that they plan to cut 1000 jobs. They also plan to reduce their flight departures by 15%. The job losses will account for about 10% of their work force and affects pilots, cabin crew, technicians and service staff. The cuts are due to start on November 9 of this year and then lead into 2009.

Bill Ayer, chairman and CEO of Alaska Air Group said, "The one-two punch of record oil prices and a softening economy, on top of increased competition, has burdened Alaska Air Group with a $50 million loss on an adjusted basis for the first half of this year. That demands decisive action to ensure the viability of our company."

The airline made a $50m loss in the first half of this year. They currently have a fleet of 111 Boeing 737s and around 10,000 staff. 

These calls come around the same time as other airlines are making cuts due to the rising fuel costs. They also come as British leisure group XL entered administration.
