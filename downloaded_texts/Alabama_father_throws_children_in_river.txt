Lam Luong, a 37 year old shrimp fisherman from Irvington, Bayou La Batre, Alabama, United States, has confessed to throwing his four children off an 80 feet high bridge after a fight with his wife the day before. Police have charged Luong with 4 counts of capital murder.

Family members and friends told Fox News that the couple had been fighting over several things, including Luong's girlfriend, on Sunday evening and Monday morning. Luong later drove off with his four children, whom he reported missing to the police and claimed he had left them with his girlfriend who lives in a hotel. Police however became suspicious due to "holes in his story" and he later changed his story. The Associated Press say that the authorities believe that Dauphin Island Bridge is where Luong threw the four children, of which he was the biological father of three, into the water.

Initially the family had feared that Luong had traded his children to fund a drug habit. Luong's wife, Ngoc Phan, is at the family home which they shared with her mother. She was not available to comment to the media, but other family members said that they still have hope that the children are alive.

Police and other authorities are using divers, dogs and helicopters to search for the bodies in a 100-square-mile area with a total of 70 people on the case. The search had to be called off on Wednesday due to fog. Luong is scheduled to appear in court on Thursday January 10, 2008.
