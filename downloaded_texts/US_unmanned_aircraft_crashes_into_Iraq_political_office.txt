An unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) belonging to the US military has crashed in the northern Iraq city of Mosul. The Shadow drone struck the roof of the Islamic Party's office.

The UAV then bounced down into the building's yard, and is not thought to have been shot down. No injuries were reported and Major Derrick Cheng says the location of the crash is a pure coincidence.

Party member Yahya Abid Mahjob said the party was requesting that the military take greater care with their UAVs. The Shadow, which is an unarmed reconnaissance plane, has been retrieved by US forces.

Earlier this month, another US UAV crashed in central Iraq. The Predator came down without causing damage or injuries. It is a larger vehicle capable of firing Hellfire missiles.
