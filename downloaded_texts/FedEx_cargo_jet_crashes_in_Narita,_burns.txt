On Monday, a FedEx McDonnell Douglas MD-11 cargo jet flying from Guangzhou, China to Tokyo, Japan crash-landed at Tokyo's Narita International Airport at around 7 a.m. local time. The plane landed during high winds, and bounced twice upon landing before flipping over and bursting into flames. 

Firecrews were dispatched to the scene, and the airport was closed. The fire subsequently destroyed most of the aircraft. Incoming flights were diverted to other airports. Wind gusts around the time of the accident were 30 to 50 mph. 

The pilots, Kevin Mosley and Anthony Stephen-Pino, were taken to a local hospital where they were pronounced dead. A hospital official confirmed them as being American men. There were no others aboard the plane. The National Transportation Safety Board said it is deploying a team to Japan to assist with the investigation. 

The crash was the first fatal accident at Narita Airport, according to Japan's Ministry of Transport.
