University of Memphis football player Taylor Bradford died after being the victim of what police are calling a targeted attack. The shooting occurred near a campus housing complex Sunday night at 9:45 p.m. (10:45 EST)

Bradford hailed from Nashville, Tennessee and transferred to Memphis in 2006.

Following the shooting, Bradford got into his car and attempted to drive away before crashing a short distance away. Regional Medical Center Memphis spokeswoman Sandy Snell said Bradford was taken to the hospital and pronounced dead shortly after 10:15 p.m. University President Shirley Raines said the student body was notified at 3:44 a.m. via a mass text message. Raines also said, "This was an act directed specifically toward the victim and it was not a random act of violence."

No suspects have been named in the shooting.

The campus was locked down for a short time following the shooting of the 21-year-old junior defensive lineman. University spokesman Curt Gunther said classes were canceled as a precaution.

The University's football team, The Memphis Tigers, will play tomorrow night at home against Marshall University, as scheduled. The team's head coach Tommy West said, "Our entire football team is deeply saddened by the loss of Taylor... He was well respected and a popular member of our team."

Classes are expected to resume on Tuesday, and police say that the investigation will continue.
