A video released by the Mujahideen Shura Council operating in Iraq shows an attack on an American sniper town in the city of Ramadi.

At the beginning of the clip it says this is revenge on the sniper who killed a young girl and her mother. Apparently the sniper also killed a local civilian on Monday.

The official press release by the group is translated, quoted below, and sourced.
