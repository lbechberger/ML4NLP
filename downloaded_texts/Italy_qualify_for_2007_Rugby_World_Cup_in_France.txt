Italy have qualified for the 2007 Rugby World Cup in France. Italy began their qualification process in Round 5 of the European tournaments. The Italians went through relatively easily, finishing with a 150-7 aggregate score over their only two games.

Italy in Pool A of Round 5, won their first match against Portugal 83 points to nil in L'Aquila on October 7. The following week they defeated Russia 67 to 7 in Moscow, sealing top position in the pool and sending them into next year's World Cup as Europe 1.

Italy enters Pool C of the World Cup, alongside the All Blacks of New Zealand and Scotland, as well as two other nations that have yet to qualify (Europe 2 and Repechage 1). Italy have appeared at every World Cup since the first tournament in 1987, their best result being in 2003 with two wins. Portugal and Russia both can still qualify for the World Cup, with the nations meeting next week in Lisbon. The second placed team in the pool will advance to Round 6 to play the runner-up of Pool B.
