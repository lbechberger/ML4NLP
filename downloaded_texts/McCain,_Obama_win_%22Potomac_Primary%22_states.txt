Barack Obama, the junior senator from Illinois and 2008 US presidential candidate has swept all three of today's Democratic contests in the "Potomac primaries" consisting of the nation's capital, Washington, D.C. and the bordering states of Virginia and Maryland. 

Obama led in the Virginia polls 67 percent, while in the District of Columbia, he lead 76 percent over opponent, New York senator Hillary Clinton's 24 percent. This sweep gives him a slight lead over Clinton in the delegate count. Meanwhile, the Clinton campaign lost an aide today, as campaign aide Mike Henry resigned making light of a small staffing crisis within the campaign as Clinton just replaced her campaign manager Patty Solis Doyle with Maggie Williams. Doyle remains with the campaign as a senior advisor.

Meanwhile, John McCain, the senator from Arizona and 2008 US presidential candidate has swept all three of today's Republican contests in the Potomac primaries. McCain obtained a slim margin of victory over opponent, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee in Virginia and had a lead over Huckabee by nine points in the District.
