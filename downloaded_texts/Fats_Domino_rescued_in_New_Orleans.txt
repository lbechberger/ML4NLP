Legendary R&amp;B singer Fats Domino has been accounted for, three days after Hurricane Katrina hit in his hometown of New Orleans, Louisiana.

Fats Domino was found on Monday by a helicopter searching for residents stranded in floodwaters. He was identified by his daughter from a photo taken Monday by a New Orleans Times-Picayune photographer. However, while it is known that Domino was rescued, his whereabouts and the whereabouts of his family are not immediately clear.

The singer had told his agent, Al Embry, that he planned to stay at his home with his wife and daughter, rather than evacuate. He had not been heard from since before the storm hit. Domino, 77, lives in the city's 9th Ward, one of the areas hardest hit by Katrina. Attempts to reach Domino by phone proved futile, as phone lines have not been working in the area since the storm hit.

Antoine 'Fats' Domino first gained stardom with one of the first rock n' roll records, "The Fat Man". The record went platinum, selling over a million copies and hitting #2 on the Billboard charts. Of Domino's numerous Top 40 singles, perhaps his most notable were Blue Monday and a cover of Blueberry Hill.

Domino retired from touring in the 1980s, and has not left the city since, citing his dislike of touring, and his love of New Orleans cuisine. Not even his induction to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame or an invitation to the White House were able to get Domino to leave the town.
