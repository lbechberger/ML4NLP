A two-minute silence at noon BST (UTC+1) has been marked by millions across the United Kingdom and the European Union to remember those who died last Thursday in the London attacks.

In London, all buses and cabs came to halt, and all people in their offices stood outside. Trains were not stopped but the two-minute silence was announced and marked through the underground and overground services. Aeroplanes delayed their takeoff to respect the two-minute silence.

At the bombing sites, wreaths were laid in respect, with hundreds gathering at the sites to mark the silence.

At Buckingham Palace, Queen Elizabeth II stood on the forecourt in silence, accompanied by Foot Guards. Prime Minister Tony Blair marked the silence in the garden of 10 Downing Street, and Mayor of London Ken Livingstone paid his respects at Trafalgar Square. 

At The Open Championship taking place at St Andrews, golfers also paid their respects. Yesterday, Anfield stadium fell in silence during the Liverpool F.C. vs TNS UEFA Champios League football match.
 
In Paris, France, President Jacques Chirac stood in silence at the Elysee Palace before taking part in the Bastille Day parade. The European Parliament marked the silence along with European Commission offices across the EU. 

A vigil will be held in Trafalgar Square, London at 18:00 (6 p.m.) BST (+1 UTC).
