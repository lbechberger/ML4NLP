Tropical Storm Richard formed in the western Caribbean Thursday and is currently moving slowly westward towards Honduras. A gradual motion to the west is expected later on, and the tropical storm is forecast to impact Honduras and then the Yucatan Peninsula. As a result, several watches and warnings are in effect for Honduras from its border with Nicaragua west to Limón and the Bay islands. 

Richard currently sustains winds of 45 mph (75 kph) and is expected to strengthen further, possibly into a hurricane by Saturday. Richard has dumped heavy rains over Jamaica and is expected to produce rainfall in Honduras, then trek towards the Yucatan Peninsula and enter the Gulf of Mexico.

Richard has already caused widespread flooding across western parishes of Jamaica, which is currently under a flash flood watch. A hurricane watch and tropical storm warning are in effect for the north coast of Honduras from the Nicaragua/Honduras border westward to Limón to the Bay islands. A hurricane watch is in effect for eastern Mexico from Gruesa to Chetumal. There is also a tropical storm watch up for Belize and a tropical storm warning for Honduras from Limón westward to the Guatemala border. Richard is not expected to be a threat to oil rigs in the Gulf of Mexico.
