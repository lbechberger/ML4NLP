Miles Levin, 18, American teen with cancer and inspirational blogger, died of alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma. 

Miles Alpern Levin received world-wide attention with the blog he wrote as he fought cancer. He was interviewed for US national news. Levin died on Sunday, August 19 after a 26 month battle with alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma. 

In six more days he would have been 19 years old. He was first diagnosed in June 2005. He graduated from high school in June 2007. He gave the commencement speech with news anchor Bob Woodruff. The Sarcoma Foundation of America gave Levin their Leadership &amp; Courage Award for 2008 and recorded his acceptance speech in advance. He was accepted to attend Kalamazoo College. He won other awards as well. 

From his blog (June 10, 2007), "Thursday night was the Senior Awards Ceremony, where I was awarded a Booth Family Citation (the Booths founded Cranbrook [his school] ) for exceptional sense of responsibility and unusual contribution to the school, plus a Strickland Creative Writing Award."

In his blog, he wrote about normal high school events, applying to college, going to prom, Senior awards night, his girlfriend. He also wrote about things most teenagers do not -- the pain of chemotherapy, staying in Ronald McDonald house, being recognized on the street of New York City from a national interview. His blog was read by thousands during the final months of his life. Family members also contributed, giving updates when he was not able to write.

Levin is survived by his parents, Jon and Nancy Levin, and his sister, Nina. The funeral will be private.
