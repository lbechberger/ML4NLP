Rescuers are still searching for the bodies of three children, presumed dead, after an eruption by an Indonesian volcano on Saturday.

Located on the Palu'e Island, Mount Rokatenda threw rock and ash into the sky causing local destruction. Lava spilled onto the beach, killing three adults and three children in their sleep. Rescuers have recovered the bodies of the adults but the childrenâ€™s remains have still not been found.

In an interview with the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, Tini Thadeus, head of the local disaster agency, says he is pessimistic about recovering the bodies. Due to the remains being buried under hot material, Thadeus believes they will be difficult to reach.

Indonesian rescuer Bakri Kari raises more doubt about the recovery as he describes the scene, saying that it was "tough" walking in the area as the ground is "covered in ash 10 to 20 centimeters thick." Despite this, the search for the bodies continues.

When the volcano became active, 2,000 people evacuated the island, while 8,000 remained.
