Ferrari driver Kimi Räikkönen won the FIA Formula-1 2007 French Grand Prix on the Circuit de Nevers Magny-Cours at Magny-Cours, France.

His teammate Felipe Massa, starting from pole, was unable to hold back Kimi and finished second.

The promising McLaren-Mercedes driver Lewis Hamilton showed fastest times in the first and second qualification sessions, but lost the pole to Massa in the third. He also dropped to the third podium place in the race.

His teammate Fernando Alonso, who started in the 10th position, suffered a gearbox problem in Q3 but managed to climb to 7th place on the back of his former Renault teammate Giancarlo Fisicella. Giancarlo himself lost one position to Nick Heidfeld, BMW Sauber.

Both BMWs classified 4th and 5th, Robert Kubica, who fully recovered from Montreal crash, and Nick Heidfeld respectively.
