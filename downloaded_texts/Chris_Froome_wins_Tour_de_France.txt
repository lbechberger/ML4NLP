The British cyclist Chris Froome won the 100th Tour de France yesterday following the conclusion of the final stage in Paris. The final stage of the Tour was won by Marcel Kittel from Germany. Froome's total time for the 3,400 km (2,112 miles) tour was 83 hours, 56 minutes and 40 seconds, four minutes and twenty seconds faster than the runner-up, Nairo Quintana from Colombia.

Quintana edged out Froome by eleven points to take the King of the Mountains jersey while Peter Sagan took the green points jersey. 169 riders completed the twenty-stage tour at Paris' Champs Élysées.

Last year, Froome came second to Sir Bradley Wiggins who did not participate this year following injuries. Froome's victory speech was dedicated to his mother Jane, who died in 2008 from cancer: "Without her encouragement to follow my dreams, I'd probably be at home watching this event on TV. It's a great shame she never got to come see the Tour, but I'm sure she'd be extremely proud if she were here tonight."

British Prime Minister David Cameron tweeted congratulations to the 28-year-old Froome: "A brilliant win by Chris Froome. After two British winners it's only right the Tour de France comes to Yorkshire next year".
