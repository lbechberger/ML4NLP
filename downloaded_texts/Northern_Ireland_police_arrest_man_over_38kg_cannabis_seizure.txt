An unidentified 28-year-old man has been taken into custody after police in Northern Ireland seized a large amount of cannabis upon the planned police raid of a house in the town of Magherafelt Tuesday. The seizure, which contained 38 kilograms (84 pounds) of cannabis resin, reportedly had an estimated street value of £380,000 (US$612,000 or €474,000).

A later police search of a vehicle also uncovered a large quantity of money. The cannabis is to be examined by forensic investigators.

"This is another brilliant success in the fight against drugs for the Magherafelt area," said Chief Inspector Sam Donaldson, Magherafelt's area commander. "This seizure was as a result of information received from the public and I am extremely grateful to the community for their assistance in this investigation."
