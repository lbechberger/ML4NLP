The first exit poll, just published, has shown that 55% of French voters have rejected the new proposed European Constitution. The result which was quoted on French national TV confirms widespread speculation among political commentators that France would say no by a considerable margin - opinion polls before the vote showed 56% were against the constitution.

It is believed that a significant majority of Frances 42m eligible voters have exercised their right to vote. Turnout is thought to have exceeded 70%. Polling ended at the 55,000 polling stations across the country 8pm, except in Paris and Lyon where voting finished at 10pm.
