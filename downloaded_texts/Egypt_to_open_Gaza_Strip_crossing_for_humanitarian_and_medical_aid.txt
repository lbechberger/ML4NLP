Egypt will open a Gaza Strip crossing for humanitarian and medical aid.

Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak ordered the opening of the Rafah Border Crossing. Food and medical supplies will be allowed, but not concrete or steel. It will be made available for ill and injured Palestinians seeking medical treatment.

Rafah is the only point on the Gaza border not controlled by Israel; a 2005 agreement put Palestine and Israel in charge of the border, with observation from the European Union. United Nations officials had demanded an end to the Gaza blockade.

This comes after there has been international criticism of the death of activists when Israeli commandos raided Turkish ships in the international waters of the Mediterranean Sea. The six-ship “Freedom Flotilla” was carrying some 10,000 tonnes of supplies and was planning to breach the Gaza blockade. Details are unknown, with information limited to Israeli military briefings.
