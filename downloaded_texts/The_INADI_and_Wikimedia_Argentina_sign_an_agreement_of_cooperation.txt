The National Institute against Discrimination, Xenophobia and Racism (INADI) and the non-profit association Wikimedia Argentina signed an agreement of cooperation and technical assistance.

The signature took place in the INADI's auditorium, located in 750 Moreno Street, in Buenos Aires, the capital of the country. There were present María José Lubertino, chairwoman of the INADI, and Patricio Lorente, chairman of Wikimedia Argentina, who signed an agreement that includes the accomplishment of joint activities that help to promote and guarantee the free access to knowledge; the promotion and diffusion of economic, social, cultural, linguistic and environmental rights and the establishment of strategies for the prevention of discriminatory practices.

The non-profit association Wikimedia Argentina is a local chapter of Wikimedia Foundation, organization presided by Jimmy Wales, inventor of the famous virtual encyclopedia Wikipedia, which is today one of the more used resources in the world.

A local chapter is a NGO that shares the aims and the mission of the Wikimedia Foundation. Wikimedia Argentina is the first chapter whose principal language is Spanish, though it foments the creation and development of projects in original languages as the Guarani, the Quechua and the Aymara. In this respect, one of the principal aims that will work with the INADI will be the development of encyclopedias in indigenous languages, an indispensable tool for the collectivities whose culture is threatened.
