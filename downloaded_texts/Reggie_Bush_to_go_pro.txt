USC Trojans running back Reggie Bush has decided to enter the NFL draft and forfeit his final year of college football eligibility. The Heisman Trophy winner is the favorite to be the top pick in the draft, in which case he would play for the Houston Texans. 

Bush rushed for 1,740 yards during his final college season, and led the Trojans to the Rose Bowl. Quarterbacks Marcus Vick of the Virginia Tech Hokies and Vince Young of the Texas Longhorns are also likely to among the top draft picks this year.

But Vick, who was kicked off the Hokies team for repeated brushes with the law off the field, had his chances in the draft further reduced by his latest misdemeanor arrest Sunday for brandishing a firearm at a man he believed made a comment about the young woman he was with.
