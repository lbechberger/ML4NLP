The families of workers killed in the blast at the Stockline plastics factory in 2004, are criticizing the Â£400,000 fine imposed on the company.

They are upset at the amount of the fine imposed on the company.

The Scottish TUC gave the following statement: 
"No level of fine can adequately reflect the loss that these families have suffered. Our justice system appears to be totally inflexible in the sentences that judges can impose following breaches of health and safety legislation."
