Canadian pop and R&amp;B singer Justin Bieber has announced he will publish a memoir. Titled Justin Bieber: First Step 2 Forever: My Story, the hardcover book features several photos and will cover the sixteen-year-old's "journey to superstardom".

In a statement issued through HarperCollins, the memoir's publisher, Bieber said, "My fans have played such a large part in all of this and they help me live my dreams every day. I'm excited to share just a little bit more of my world with them through this book. Between the behind-the-scenes pictures and the story, I think this is going to be something they can all enjoy. This is just another way for me to say thank you to my fans."

The book is scheduled to be sold for US$21.99 starting on October 22. Along with a planned biopic and a biographical comic book titled Fame: Justin Bieber, the memoir is to form Bieber's three-part biography.
