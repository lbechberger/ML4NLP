Jayant Patel, wanted for manslaughter, grievous bodily harm and fraud in Australia, was arrested by FBI agents in Oregon, United States and is scheduled to face an extradition hearing on April 10.

According to an affidavit filed by US prosecutors, Patel, previously restricted from performing surgery in the US due to "professional misconduct", lied about his professional history in order to work at Bundaberg Base Hospital in Bundaberg, Queensland.

Patel performed surgeries at Bundaberg that are alleged to have directly led to the deaths of several of his patients, including one procedure which he had previously been banned from performing in Oregon. The incidents led to Patel being nicknamed "Dr Death".

If successfully extradited to Australia, Patel "will get a fair trial", according to the Federal Member for Hinkler, Paul Neville, whose electorate includes Bundaberg, although the extradition may take some time due to Patel's US citizenship.
