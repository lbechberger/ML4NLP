Two Palestinians were shot dead by the Israel Defense Forces (idf) in the West Bank on Thursday, after allegedly assaulting soldiers. The separate incidents occurred within hours of each other. 

Police said that a Palestinian had stabbed and wounded a soldier, before he was shot dead by a paramilitary policeman. Just hours later at a nearby location, another Palestinian man was killed after trying to attack a soldier with a knife, according to the IDF. 

One witness, Hani Hadoush argued that security forces had unnecessarily shot the young man. “Then the youth fell on the ground, he was holding nothing at all” she said. On the same day, people were throwing stones at cars near the village of Beit Einun, outside of Hebron. A woman suffered minor glass injuries to her face, after stones shattered her vehicles' window. 

These events, among other incidents, took place during a wave of riots and civil unrest throughout the West Bank this week. 

Reuters reported that since the 1st of October, at least 62 Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank and Gaza; 35 of those being armed assailants.
