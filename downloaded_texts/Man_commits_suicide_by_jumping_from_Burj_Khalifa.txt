A man committed suicide on Tuesday by jumping from the Burj Khalifa in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. The unnamed man, believed to be in his twenties and of a South Asian ethnicity, jumped from the 147th floor and landed on a decking area of the 108th floor. His death would be the first known suicide that has happened at the skyscraper—currently the tallest in the world—since the building opened in January 2010.

The owner of the building, Emaar Properties, released a statement saying that at 09:00 local time Tuesday, "an incident involving a male" was reported. They continued, saying, "The concerned authorities have confirmed that it was a suicide, and we are awaiting the final report." According to witness statements taken by the police, co-workers said the man had had a holiday request denied.

Suicide rates in the United Arab Emirates are higher than several other developed countries. Workers in Dubai say they suffer from "social abuse," facing long work hours and few days off. Chenji, a Chinese worker in Dubai, spoke to the Big News Network about the man's suicide, saying, "It's a desperate act." He added, "They promise things they don't give once you get here."

The Burj Khalifa has been temporarily closed to visitors as a result of Tuesday's incident.
