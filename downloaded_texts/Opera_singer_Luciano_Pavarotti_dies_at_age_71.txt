World-famous opera singer Luciano Pavarotti died early Thursday morning, according to a statement by his manager. On August 10th, Pavarotti, 71, was admitted to Modena University Polyclinic in Modena, Italy with a high fever. The cause of the fever was unknown, though some reports stated that he was being treated for pneumonia.

"The Maestro fought a long, tough battle against the pancreatic cancer which eventually took his life. In fitting with the approach that characterized his life and work, he remained positive until finally succumbing to the last stages of his illness," said Terri Robson, Pavarotti's manager in a statement to the press.

Pavarotti had been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer last year, and in July of 2006 he underwent surgery to remove a cancerous mass. According to Nicoletta Mantovani, Pavarotti's wife, he had also been receiving radiation treatments.

Pavarotti's death came only one day after becoming the first recipient of the new "Excellence in Italian Culture Award" from the Italian government, the Italian Culture Ministry reported on Tuesday evening. The tenor received the award for promoting Italian culture abroad and within Italy itself. The opera house where he performed for the first time 40 years ago, La Scala opera house in Milan, stated it will organize a singing contest in honor of the Italian tenor.
