According to the Associated Press, a United States Navy F-18 fighter jet has crashed into a house in a residential area in San Diego, California, near University City High School. The crash occurred around 12:00 p.m. (Pacific Time) as the plane was preparing for landing at the Marine Corps Air Station Miramar.

Reports say that the pilot was able to eject from the plane before it crashed and is believed to have suffered only minor injuries. At least three people on the ground were killed, and one person is missing.

Eye witness Joe Kreischer told the LA Times, "It was chugging along with what seemed like one engine. Then I heard a roar of engine and all of a sudden, woop, dead silence."
Two houses burned down as a result of the crash.

Authorities and military officials are investigating the cause of the crash.

The four dead family members are known to have been Korean Methodists. Only the father Dong Yun Yoon was not in the house when it was destroyed.
