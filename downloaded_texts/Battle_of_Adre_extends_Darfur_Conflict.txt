After the Battle of Ardre, many civilians and military officers of both Chadian and Sudanese origin were killed. After this, Chad declared (according to some translations) a "a state of war" against Sudan, and encouraged all of its people to honor that declaration. There have been many conflicting reports of the number of deaths, but a good estimate would be that both sides have lost around 400-600 people. 

These battles and declarations is just a continuation of the Darfur that has ravaged this region for several years past. As tensions between the two nations get more fierce, we can only imagine what might come next.
