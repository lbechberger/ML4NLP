Finnish symphonic rock/symphonic power metal soloist Tarja Turunen has played the first dates on her debut tour as a solo artist after losing her position as the lead vocalist for Nightwish.

The tour is in support of her new album My Winter Storm. Tarja has met with some early success as a solo artist, with the album certified gold in Finland - signifying sales in excess of 15,000 copies - and the first single I Walk Alone entering the German charts at number 16.

The first show of the tour was in Berlin, Germany. That was followed by a concert in Budapest, Hungary. She is to return to Germany tomorrow, to perform I Walk Alone at the final fight of German boxing champion Regina Halmich.

Said a statement by Turunen on the opening gig: "The first show in Berlin was just great!! Everybody in the band, including myself, was really nervous. It is normal that in the first show some things are not really working yet. We were ready to have a total catastrophe in the middle of the concert, but luckily it didn't happen! I sensed that the audience was really listening everything carefully and I got the feeling that they enjoyed the show. That makes me very happy and delighted. There was a good spirit. It was funny to see the entire band, including two drum sets, in a small stage! But our crew managed to make us fit thereâ€¦ I am sure that things are getting better from now on. As for the first show, Berlin was amazing beginning for us. Thanks so much for all the nice and wonderful persons in the audience. I felt your support and love. You made a bit difficult for me to continue singing at some points during the concert. Just to bring down the myth that German people is cold[sic]. I think you were great and very, very warm."
