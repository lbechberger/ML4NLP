The new Italian government, led by Silvio Berlusconi, received a vote of confidence from the Italian House of Deputies on Wednesday. The tally was 334 pros, 240 cons and 2 abstentions.

The vote allows Berlusconi up to another year in office, during which time he will have to gain support from skeptical voters if he is to win a second term.
