An assembly man in Berlin, Germany stole one million screws from his co-workers and auctioned them over the internet. He was arrested at his apartment on Wednesday.

For two years, the 33-year-old stole up to 7,000 screws per day and hid them in a hiding place. Today he has 1.1 million screws that are valued at 110,000 euros (US$155,000).

"In the end, it became obvious that screws were being sold for much less than they usually cost," said police spokesperson for the WÃ¼rzburg police. The man's name has not been released and he is in custody awaiting charges.
