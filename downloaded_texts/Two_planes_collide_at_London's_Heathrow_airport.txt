Two planes were involved in a collision Monday night at London's Heathrow airport. Fire and rescue officials reported no injuries. 

The two planes, a British Airways Boeing 747, and a Sri Lankan Airlines Airbus A340 were reported to have clipped each other's wingtips while taxiing on an airport runway. 

The passengers on both jets are currently being taken back to the terminal while engineers inspect both aircraft.
