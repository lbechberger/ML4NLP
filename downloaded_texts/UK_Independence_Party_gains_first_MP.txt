The United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP) has gained its first representation in the House of Commons today.

Dr. Bob Spink, MP for Castle Point, Essex has recently defected from the Conservative Party over an alleged attempt by local Conservatives to deselect him. He claims to have been "disenchanted" with the party for years and denounced Conservatative policies, saying "I have been increasingly disappointed with the Tory party's failure to be honest with the public on a wide range of issues like pensions, crime, immigration and defence, which is why I voted against the Tory whip so often in recent years and finally resigned the whip last month."

He said he was "delighted to join the UKIP team, helping to fight for Britain's interests in Europe and for better policy on the issues that really matter to people", adding that "UKIP provides an alternative that's not the BNP and a party that listens to the people."

He was welcomed with open arms by UKIP, party leader Nigel Farage saying he is "delighted to welcome the hard-working and deeply principled Bob Spink as UKIP's first member of Parliament," calling Spink "articulate, quite controversial and a bit of a character". One of UKIP's two peers, Lord Willoughby de Broke, added "I am thrilled that UKIP now has a representative in the House of Commons. I look forward to working with him to further UKIP's programme of leaving the European Union." 

Dr. Spink has rejected ideas of holding a local by-election, saying on BBC Radio 4's Today programme "I was elected as Bob Spink. I work hard for my constituents and I will continue to do so. I am following to the letter every word that I promised them in my manifesto and I only wish the parties were doing the same, including the Tory Party." UKIP say they are confident he will retain his seat at the next general election.
