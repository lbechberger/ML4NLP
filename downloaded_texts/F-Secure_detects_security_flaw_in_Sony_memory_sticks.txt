Security firm F-Secure announced on Monday they have confirmed rootkit-like behavior within the software provided by electronics giant Sony in their MicroVault USB memory sticks.

F-Secure had received a report that their DeepGuard software was highlighting an issue when the memory stick was connected.

After closer analysis by F-Secure it was identified that the software was creating a hidden directory within the users computer that neither the user or anti-virus software could detect. They say that the issue is similar to the one in 2005 where Sony DRM software allowed malware to be hidden from users.

Mcafee, another major security firm, said: "The apparent intent was to cloak sensitive files related to the fingerprint verification feature included on the USB drives."

"As with the Sony BMG case we, of course, contacted Sony before we decided to go public with the case. However, this time we received no reply from them," said F-Secure in a blog post.
