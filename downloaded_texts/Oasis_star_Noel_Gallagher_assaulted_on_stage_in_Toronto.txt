Noel Gallagher, lead guitarist and songwriter for British rock band Oasis, was assaulted on September 7 as his band headlined the Virgin Festival in Toronto, Canada.

The band was in the middle of a performance of the song "Morning Glory" when the attacker, Daniel Sullivan, 47, ran on to the stage and pushed Noel over before attempting to attack Liam Gallagher.

Security officials quickly apprehended Sullivan and had to restrain Liam from attacking Sullivan. Gallagher was admitted to hospital. After a 15-minute delay the band returned to complete the set but refused to play an encore.

Gallagher wrote on his blog that the attacker "evaded our crack security team and assaulted my midriff."

Noel Gallagher had fallen on his monitor speakers and received bruised hips and ribs which forced Oasis to cancel two scheduled North American concerts, including one in New York. The concert ending their Canadian tour, to be held in London, Ontario, has been rescheduled to December 15.
