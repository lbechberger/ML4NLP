A law was passed that will prevent clerical, technical and health care workers from striking when the University of Minnesota students return to classes on Tuesday, however, the new law makes no guarantee about workers striking on Wednesday. 

According to Jan Johnson, with the Minnesota Bureau of Mediation Services, both sides do wish to avoid a strike if at all possible. 

The American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees have filed for a ten-day notice to strike, however, the ten-day notice to strike law requires that the tenth day of the cooling-off period fall on a day other than a Saturday, Sunday or a holiday, thus, Labor Day Monday is out of reason. A strike, therefore, would not be possible until at least Wednesday, the second day of classes.
