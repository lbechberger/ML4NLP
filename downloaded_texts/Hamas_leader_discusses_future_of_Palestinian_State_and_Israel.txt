Yesterday, Hamas leader Mahmoud al-Zahar responded to Wolf Blitzer's questions with accusations that Israel is dedicated to establishing a state covering all land between the Nile and the Euphrates rivers. Blitzer pressed al-Zahar who then stated that the blue lines on the Israeli flag represent the two rivers.
 
Al-Zahar said that the new Israeli state would include Palestine, Sinai, Syria, Jordan and part of Saudi Arabia and that the Knesset lays out the expansion plan. He went on to challenge Blitzer to ask Israeli leaders about the matter.

When the topic turned to whether Hamas has the goal of destroying Israel, the Hamas leader said that it was Israel who has atomic weapons so it is more likely that Palestine would be destroyed than Israel.
