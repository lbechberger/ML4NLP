American playwright William Gibson has died at the age of 94 in Massachusetts, according to reports. The cause of death was not publicly disclosed, but BBC News says he died in his home.

Gibson is likely most famous for the play he wrote in 1957 entitled The Miracle Worker, which was based on the autobiography of the blind and deaf woman, Helen Keller called The Story of My Life. The play, originally written for television, went on Broadway in 1960, where it later won three Tony Awards. It went on to become a movie in 1962 where it also won several Oscars.

Gibson wrote 12 plays throughout his career, including Golden Boy, Golda Balcony in 2003, which was about former Israeli prime minister, Golda Meir. It was his last play before his death.

"The act of writing makes everything possible to me. I've always found the business of writing has helped me to live," said Gibson in an interview with the Associated Press in 2003.
