Hillary Clinton earned a victory in West Virginia Tuesday night as the American Democratic Presidential campaign continues. She took two-thirds of the votes over rival Barack Obama. 

Despite the commanding lead that Obama has for the Democratic nomination, Clinton continues to be committed to campaigning until the party convention in late August.

Clinton won 67% of the vote. This is significantly ahead of the figure of 26% achieved by Obama.

She commented on her victory in speech made to her supporters. "There are some who have wanted to cut this race short, but here in West Virginia, you know a thing or two about rough roads to the top of the mountain."

"I'm more determined than ever to carry on this campaign until everyone has had a chance to make their voices heard," she also said.
