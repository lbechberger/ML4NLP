The Reuters news agency has retracted a photograph of Beirut, Lebanon, after finding out that it was altered. Reuters released a statement saying: "Photo editing software was improperly used on this image. A corrected version will immediately follow this advisory. We are sorry for any inconvience." The photograph had shown two plumes of black smoke rising out of buildings in Beirut. 

Meanwhile a Reuters employee was suspended after using Reuters internet access to issue a threat saying, "I look forward to the day when you pigs get your throats cut." The e-mail was sent to Charles Johnson, who maintains the Little Green Footballs blog. Johnson said: "This particular death threat is a bit different from the run of the mill hate mail we get around here, because an IP lookup on the sender reveals that he/she/it was using an account at none other than Reuters News. I think it's more than fair to say that Reuters has a big problem." 

Reuters spokesman Ed Williams said: "I can confirm that an employee has been suspended pending further investigation. The individual was not an employee of Reuters' news division."
