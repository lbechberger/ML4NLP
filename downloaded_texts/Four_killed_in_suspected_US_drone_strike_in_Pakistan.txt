Pakistani intelligence officials said today that at least four people have been killed in a suspected US drone strike in the North Waziristan province.

Officials say missiles hit a house and a vehicle near the town Miranshah. The region is near Pakistan's border with Afghanistan.

"The US drone fired two missiles on a house. The house was completely destroyed," said an unnamed security official.

The attack comes a day after Pakistani president Asif Ali Zardari warned that US drone strikes were undermining Pakistan's "national consensus" in his country's war against rebel groups in the area. However, visiting US lawmakers told Pakistani officials the US could not afford to abandon the controversial missile strikes.
