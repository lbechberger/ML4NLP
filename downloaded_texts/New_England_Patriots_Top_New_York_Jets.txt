NFL opening week continued with AFC East rivals New York Jets hosting the New England Patriots at Giants Stadium. The Patriots signed wide receiver Randy Moss during the off-season, and it didn't take him long to showcase his talents. Randy Moss caught all 9 passes thrown to him for a total of 183 yards and 1 touchdown. The 183 receiving yards represented the third-most in New England franchise history and are the fourth-most of Moss' career.

New England's quarterback, Tom Brady, completed 22 of 28 passes for 297 yards, with three touchdown passes and no interceptions. 

The Patriots struck first with a touchdown pass from Brady to Wes Walker in the first quarter and the Jets evened the score in the second quarter with a pass from Chad Pennington to Laveranues Coles. However, aft that, New England scored 3 consecutive touchdowns for a 28-7 lead and never looked back, eventually winning 38-14. 

Chad Pennington hurt his ankle in the third quarter on a hard hit by Jarvis Green, but came back after one set of downs. He is scheduled to meet with team doctors this week to evaluate the injury. 

The Patriots host the San Diego Chargers, a highly anticipated AFC match-up Sunday 9/16 at 8:15pm EST while the Jets visit the Ravens in Baltimore on Sunday 9/16 at 4:15pm EST.
