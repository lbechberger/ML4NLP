In the final game of the 2006 Tri Nations Series rugby union tournament, South Africa defeated Australia 24 points to 16 at Ellis Park in Johannesburg. Despite winning their last two games, South Africa finished third on the table, Australia second, and the All Blacks as winners. 

The loss for Australia in Johannesburg extends their poor record in South Africa - their last win there was in 2000, and their last win at Ellis Park was over 40 years ago. Fourie du Preez and Breyton Paulse both scored tries for South Africa with Andre Pretorius kicking one conversion, three penalties goals and one drop goal. Stephen Larkham scored Australia's only try and Stirling Mortlock kicking the one conversion and three penalty goals. International rugby continues throughout the rest of the year, with a number of teams involved in 2007 Rugby World Cup qualifying, and November Tests matches in the northern hemisphere.
