The US House of Reprensentatives is seeking to lift a nine year old ban on export sales of the F-22A Raptor stealth fighter. 

US lawmakers approved an amendment that would allow Lockheed Martin, the aircraft's primary manufacturer, to sell the aircraft overseas to foreign nations. Every defence bill since 1997 contained language that prohibited the sale of the multi-role aircraft to foreign nations, due to concerns that the advanced technology in the plane may reach the wrong hands. Japan and South Korea, both strong allies of the United States are considered to be likely customers, if the ban is lifted.

The amendment was introduced by Rep. Kay Granger, (R-Texas), whose constituency, the Fort Worth district is home to a major Lockheed Martin facility. The lifting of the ban comes at a time when continued US orders will no longer be guaranteed and that the aircraft's continued production is important for Lockheed Martin Aeronautics' business.
