A British Airways (BA) flight from London to Denver made an emergency landing at an airport in Iceland today after smoke was seen emerging from an oven in the aircraft's rear kitchen. 

A BA spokesman said that the Boeing 777 landed safely at Keflavik Airport. He added that the planeâ€™s 268 passengers left the craft unharmed. 

A spokeswoman from the Iceland Civil Aviation Administration ruled out any terrorist involvement. She added: "They were 50 miles from Keflavik when it was thought there was a fire. But it turned out to be only smoke."

The flight should complete its journey to the US tomorrow. Passengers are spending the night in a hotel.
