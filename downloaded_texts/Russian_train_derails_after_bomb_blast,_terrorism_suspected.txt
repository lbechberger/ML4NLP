The Neva Express passenger train heading to St. Petersburg from Moscow derails at 21:43 MSK (17:43 GMT) on August 13, 2007 after a bomb explosion near the railway station Malaya Vishera. At least 60 people have been injured, some taken to hospital, no one reported to be killed. 

The bomb made a shell-hole about 1.5 metres in diameter, officials say. 800 meters of railway track and its overhead contact system have been damaged. The bomb, determined by officials to be a homemade explosive device, was planted under the bridge.

A criminal investigation has been established by Russian officials. It has been linked to an insurgency in the south of the country around Chechnya and is, according to the Federal Security Service, part of a pattern of violent attacks connected to the insurgency.

The railway traffic was blocked in both directions. Services between St. Petersburg and Moscow were redirected via Volkhov.
