The Associated Press reported Sunday that American comedian Bernie Mac is responding well to treatment for pneumonia in a Chicago, Illinois hospital.

The report said that the pneumonia is not related to the inflammatory lung disease Mac has, which has been in remission since 2005.

Bernie Mac's representative told People that Internet rumors of critical illness and even death are untrue.

"Bernie Mac is still alive and being treated in a Chicago hospital for pneumonia and is expected to make a full recovery," said Danica Smith.
