New Zealand Meteorologist Augie Auer has died, suffering a heart attack while dining with family members in Melbourne. He was on holiday celebrating his 67th birthday and 35th wedding anniversary with wife Susan and family.

Auer was chief meteorologist at the MetService from 1990 until 1998, when Professor Auer became TV3's weekday weather presenter and the network's resident meteorologist in 2002. 
 
Professor Auer recently became involved in the debate over global warming, helping in 2006 to found the New Zealand Climate Science Coalition, a group that questions claims humanity is responsible for rising temperatures

The coalition was chaired by retired Rear Admiral Jack Welch and made up of 13 scientists, including Prof Auer, Professor Bob Carter and Associate Professor Chris de Freitas. 

The group believed the public was being given incomplete, inaccurate and biased information about the effects of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. 

It called for a Royal Commission to investigate climate change. 

Professor Augie Auer is survived by his wife, three children and five grandchildren.
