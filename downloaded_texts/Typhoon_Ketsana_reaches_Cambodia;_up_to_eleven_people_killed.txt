Typhoon Ketsana, the storm that recently wreaked havoc on the Philippines and Vietnam, reached Cambodia on Wednesday, killing at least 11 people and injuring a further 29 in the country, according to officials.

The National Committee for Disaster Management said that nine of the casualties were reported in the Kampong Thom province, located 130 kilometres north of Cambodia's capital Phnom Penh.

Officials had launched search and rescue teams to find more victims, and sent medical supplies, food, and other necessities to affected regions of the countries.

Typhoon Ketsana had earlier flooded the Philippines, causing the deaths of 246 people and displacing almost 2.3 million whose homes were flooded. 38 people were also killed in Vietnam.
