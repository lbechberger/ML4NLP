Michael Schumacher won the FIA Formula One Italian Grand Prix on the Autodromo Nazionale Monza racing track. The "Red Baron" passed the checkered flag and won the race, the 90th win in his long career. Kimi Räikkönen, the McLaren Mercedes driver started from pole, but was unable to keep up with Schumacher after the first pit-stop and finished second.

As expected, Ferrari's winner spoke of his future in Formula One after the race. He announced that he will retire from Formula One as the man who wins the most than the other drivers - a true champion of this sport. He will surely struggle the last three races and it will be much easier because of a good standings in drivers' and constructors' championship.

His closest competitor Fernando Alonso, the first Renault pilot, held an unbelievable race, but was out due to the engine failure 9 laps to go. He was heading for the third place. This closed his gap from Schumacher to the minimum of 2 points and allowed Ferrari to take the lead from Renault. Second Renault driver Giancarlo Fisichella finished fourth.

A fantastic race for the first Poland Robert Kubica - BMW Sauber driver won his first podium. In the final protocol he placed himself third though started seventh. He replaced on the podium his co-driver Nick Heidfeld who started third, but finished eighth due to the penalty for speeding on the pit-lane and a failed start.

Felipe Massa, who will replace Schumacher in Ferrari next year, had an extra pit-stop due to a tire problem thus allowed Kubica to end the race alone.

Honda drivers managed two good results - Jenson Button and Rubens Barrichello finished 5th and 6th, accordingly..
