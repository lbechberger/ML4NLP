A Knoxville, USA woman has sold her name on eBay and received an offer. Terri Iligan, age 33, will legally be named "goldenpalace.com" after the required legal work is complete.

The casino owning the website paid $15,199 over the eBay auction service.

She said that she got the idea when trying to find how much it would cost to send one of her children to a golf school previously attended by Tiger Woods.

In an interview by Knoxville TV station WATE, she said, "To my kids and to my husband, I will always be Terri." As to the opinion of her husband and children, she said, "He thinks it's funny. As long as they get to call me mom, they don't care."
