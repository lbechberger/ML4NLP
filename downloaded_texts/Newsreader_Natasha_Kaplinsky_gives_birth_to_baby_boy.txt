British newsreader Natasha Kaplinsky gave birth to a baby boy earlier this morning at around 08:30 BST. She had been on maternity leave since August 21. Kaplinsky had only been working with Five News just over a month when she announced she was pregnant. Her husband of three years, investment banker Justin Bower announced "We're absolutely thrilled."

Kaplinsky first started to work for the BBC in 2002 after a two year tenure with Sky News. She started on the BBC Breakfast show but later moved onto the BBC Six O'Clock News and later became only the third woman to present the BBC Ten O'Clock News. She left the BBC in October 2007. She also spent a short time with ITV News.

Five News released a statement saying "Her colleagues here at Five News are delighted too - and we've sent our best wishes." They also said both Kaplinsky and the baby are doing fine.
