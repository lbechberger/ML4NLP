Mamdouh Habib, a former Guantanmo Bay detainee, arrived back in Australia and was reunited with his family on Friday, after having been held in the US navy base for three years without charge.

In a statement through his Australian lawyer, Stephen Hopper, the Habib family thanked the Australian people during Mr Habib's incarereation. The statement also offered thanks for the work of Mr Habib's American lawyer saying, "Most of all we'd like to thank Joe Margulies for his excellent efforts ... Joe's the best lawyer in the world."

Mr Margulies says Mr Habib needs medical treatment for chronic physical and mental conditions he suffers from his incarceration.

Mr Habib was detained by Coalition forces in Afgahnistan three weeks after the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center in New York, on suspicion of having links to Osama bin Laden and the Al Qaeda terrorist group.
