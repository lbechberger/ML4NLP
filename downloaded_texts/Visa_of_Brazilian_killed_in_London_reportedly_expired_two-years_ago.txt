The student visa of Jean Charles de Menezes, 27, had expired two-years ago, according to the British Home Office.

Government officials state that he arrived in the UK on 13 March 2002 and was granted a six-month tourist visa and later applied for a student visa which was granted, allowing him to stay in the country until 30 June 2003. 

It is also suggested in the Home Office statement that the visa had a forged "indefinite leave to remain" stamp on it, saying that the style of the stamp was not in use at the time it was apparently meant to have been issued.

This has led to speculation that this may be a reason why de Menezes — who was mistakenly believed to have terrorist connections — fled after being confronted by police (not in uniform) at Stockwell tube station. He was shot eight times by the police — seven times in the head and once in the shoulder.

His family had said that they believed that de Menezes' visa had been renewed for an additional five-years.

In the statement made by the Home Office spokeswoman, it was denied that the information released would influence the investigation, saying: "This information is not intended in any way to prejudice or influence the independent investigation into the circumstances of Mr De Menezes' death, or any possible future proceedings."
 
The killing of de Menezes is being investigated by the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC), standard procedure for fatal shootings.

The body of Mr de Menezes was returned to Brazil on 27 July.

He is to be buried today in his home town of Gonzaga in the state of Minas Gerais.
