Ferrari driver Felipe Massa won the FIA Formula One 2008 ING Belgian Grand Prix at Spa-Francorchamps Circuit, Spa, Belgium.

McLaren Mercedes driver Lewis Hamilton lead the race from pole for a few laps before he spun backwards and allowed Kimi Räikkönen's Ferrari to pass him. Kimi maintain the lead throughout the race until the rain fell onto the track on the final laps. The series of errors was finalized by Räikkönen, who spun off the track. This led Hamilton to a chequered flag, but then, after the race, he was penalized by 25 seconds for the incident with Räikkönen. Hamilton moved to third in the final standings.

McLaren filed a formal complaint with the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) Court of Appeal on Tuesday.

"We hereby confirm we have lodged notice of appeal," McLaren's CEO Martin Whitmarsh, told the BBC. 

Nick Heidfeld thus took second place for BMW Sauber ahead of Hamilton.

Fernando Alonso came in fourth for Renault while his teammate Nelson Piquet Jr. spun off into the wall on the fourteenth lap, ending his race.

Both Sebastians, Vettel and Bourdais, did well for Toro Rosso finishing fifth and seventh from the tenth and ninth places on the starting grid respectfully. They were split by Robert Kubica (BMW), who finished sixth.

Mark Webber closed out the top eight for Red Bull-Renault.

Ferrari now leads the Championship with 12 points ahead of McLaren. Still, Lewis Hamilton retains the lead for McLaren in the drivers standings with 76 points, 2 points ahead of Felipe Massa.
