Sean Taylor, starting safety for the Washington Redskins, died this morning from injuries sustained in a shooting Monday in his Miami, Florida home. The hard-hitting safety was a Pro Bowl selection last season, and was second in the National Football League (NFL) this season in interceptions, with five.

Police responded to a 911 emergency call by Taylor's girlfriend at 1:45 a.m. EST (UTC-5) Monday morning. "According to a preliminary investigation, it appears that the victim was shot inside the home by an intruder," said Miami-Dade police in a statement. "We do not have a subject description at this time."

Taylor's father, Pedro Taylor released a statement on behalf of the family, stating "It is with deep regret that a young man had to come to his end so soon."

NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said "We extend our heartfelt sympathy to Sean's family, friends, teammates, and the Redskins' organization. This is a terrible tragedy involving the loss of a young man who leaves behind many people struggling to understand it. Our office is staying in close contact with the Redskins to provide all appropriate support to the club and Sean's family. We also are working to determine the facts surrounding this tragic event."

Goodell added that all 32 NFL teams would honor the memory of the late Redskins' star.

Redskins' owner Daniel Snyder said, "This is the worst imaginable tragedy. Our thoughts and prayers are with Sean's family."
