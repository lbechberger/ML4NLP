Dick Clark, U.S. entertainment media cultural icon, died at St. John’s Hospital in Santa Monica, California on Wednesday of a heart attack, according to his publicist Paul Shefrin. He was 82 years old.


"Attempts to resuscitate were unsuccessful," Shefrin said.

In December 2004, months after going public with his Type 2 diabetes, Clark experienced a mild stroke, after which he did less on-camera.

Clark was a charismatic and successful entertainment-industry businessman. His business Dick Clark Productions featured teen dance television programs, prime-time specials, game shows, and movies. Known as "America’s Oldest Teenager," Clark was known for his roles as host of American Bandstand and Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1993. 

"I'm encouraged by the many people who tell me I'm an inspiration to them," Clark said in an email interview with USA Today last December. He also said he would try to stay positive "and attack every day with the thought things are going to get better."

Clark is survived his by wife, two sons, and daughter.
