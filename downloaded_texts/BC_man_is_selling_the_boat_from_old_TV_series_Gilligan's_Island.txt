A man named George Schultz in Parksville, British Columbia is selling the boat from old TV series Gilligan's Island at the cost of $99,000. The cruiser, originally cost about $290,000 in the 1960s.

"There have been a couple of modifications, so it doesn't look exactly like the original," said Shultz, a boat broker who's selling the 36-foot Wheeler Express Cruiser for fellow Parksdale resident Scotty Taylor. "But it's still the original boat."
 

Originally, the boat's name was The Blue Jacket. 

"Just for the show, for a stage name, it was called the S.S. Minnow," Shultz said. The name was a reference to Newton Minnow, once chairman of the FCC.

"He just liked the boat, he wanted to restore it, it was a nice looking boat, a wooden boat, a classic and he likes classic boats," said Shultz. "The hole in the hull was actually the least of the repairs - the interior needed a lot more work". 

Someone later stole the plaque on the boat, but the 46-year-old boat still has the round life preserver with S.S. Minnow emblazoned on it and the skipper's chair.
