Former Indonesian President Suharto, 86, is in a Jakarta hospital in critical condition. Doctors say he is suffering heart problems. Chad Bouchard reports from Jakarta.

The former president was admitted to a hospital on Friday with swelling throughout his body. Doctors say Mr. Suharto's heart has become too weak to pump blood properly, and his kidneys are deteriorating.

Andi Mallarangeng, spokesman for current president Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, says the president visited Mr. Suharto in the hospital Saturday and found him too weak to talk.


"He was conscious, he was not in a coma in that sense, he was conscious, but he was very weak," he said. "The presidential doctors informed the president that President Suharto is in [a] critical situation."

Suharto ruled Indonesia for 32 years, stepping down after widespread demonstrations and rioting during the Asian economic crisis of 1998.

He has since lived quietly in an upscale district of central Jakarta.
 
The anti-corruption organization Transparency International says Mr. Suharto embezzled more from Indonesia than any other modern leader, an estimated $15 billion to $35 billion. Mr. Suharto has steadfastly denied such accusations.
