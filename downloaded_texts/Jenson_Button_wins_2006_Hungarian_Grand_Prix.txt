A rainy weekend turned out to be a great show for the spectators of the 13th round of the FIA Formula-1 championship. The Hungarian Grand Prix held on Hungaroring, Budapest provided an entertaining race with a few upsets.

An absolutely unlucky race for the Renault and Ferrari teams, only Felipe Massa finished at the tail of the peleton. Giancarlo Fisichella lost control of his car and ended the race very soon after the start. His teammate Fernando Alonso was in the lead for most of the race, but ended it right after his pit-stop, probably because a badly tucked right front wheel. Michael Schumacher ended his race not long after Alonso, because of the suspension damage in the numerous battles during the race.

Thus, the victory suddenly came to the hands of Jenson Button, Honda driver. 

Tough luck for Kimi Raikkonen, who collided with Vitantonio Liuzzi and was replaced by his teammate Pedro De La Rosa in second place.

And a very good race for Nick Heifeld, the BMW-Sauber team's driver finished third.

The race probably disproved the popular statement that "the problem of Formula-1 races is no overtaking", saying that it's not completely true
