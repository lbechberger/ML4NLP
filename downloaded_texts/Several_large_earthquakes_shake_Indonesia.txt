According to the United States Geological Survey (USGS), several large earthquakes have shaken Indonesia with the largest having a magnitude of 7.0.

The most recent quake had a magnitude of 6.4 and struck at 4:02 a.m. local time February 26, 150 kilometers (94 miles) south, southwest of Padang, Sumatra, Indonesia. The depth registered at 35 km (21.7 miles). The USGS earlier reported it as a 6.9.

The largest and first had a magnitude of 7.0 and occurred just over a half hour before. It was located 160 miles from Padang. The USGS initially reported the quake as a magnitude 7.2.

The 7.0 quake caused the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to issue a local tsunami bulletin stating that small waves were generated with larger ones close to the quake's epicenter.

A half dozen smaller quakes ranging from 5.0 to 6.0 have occurred in the same area since February 24.

So far, there are no reports of damage or injuries in any of the quakes.
