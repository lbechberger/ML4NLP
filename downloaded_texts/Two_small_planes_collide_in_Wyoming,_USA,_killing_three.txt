At least three people are dead after two small planes collided in a remote area of Wyoming in the United States.

The collision occurred between a Cirrus SR22 and a Cessna 172 near Rock Springs just before 12:30 p.m. on Sunday afternoon. The Cirrus was carrying two people, both of whom died, and was traveling from Polson, Montana to Rock Springs. The Cessna had one person on board who also died, but its destination is not yet known. One deployed parachute is reported to have been seen near the wreckage, but reports state it does not appear to have been deployed by a survivor.

FOX News quotes KSL in Salt Lake City, Utah as saying that debris from the collision was scattered over five acres in an area that made it difficult for emergency officials to get to. 

The names of the deceased have not been released, pending the notification of family members.
