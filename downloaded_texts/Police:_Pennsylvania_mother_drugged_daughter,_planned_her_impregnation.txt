A Pennsylvania woman is accused of drugging her 13-year-old daughter so the woman's boyfriend could impregnate the teen without her knowledge.

Shana Brown, 32, wanted a baby but can no longer have children. So, police said, she gave her daughter drugs and alcohol so Brown's boyfriend could have sex with the teenager and make her pregnant.

"There's some sick people on this case," said Donald Gmitter, a detective from Uniontown, where Brown lives.

Police said Brown mixed alcohol and sleeping pills into the daughter's soda and tea so she would lose consciousness. When she awakened, she was partially naked and the boyfriend, Duane Calloway, was in the room with her.

The daughter's identity was not reported by media outlets due to her age. While searching the Brown home, police found an empty rum bottle, Tylenol PM and a pill crusher.

Brown was charged with endangering the welfare of a child and was being held in a Fayette County prison as of Thursday. Calloway, who was arrested Wednesday, faces several counts of attempted rape.

Authorities said Brown suggested in December her daughter marry Calloway and have a baby for her, but that the daughter rejected the idea. According to a criminal complaint, Calloway had tried to rape the girl three times since that time.
