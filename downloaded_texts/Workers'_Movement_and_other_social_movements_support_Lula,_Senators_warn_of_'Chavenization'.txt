Representatives of the Landless Workers' Movement (MST) and other social movements linked to the Workers' Party (PT) had a meeting with the Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva on June 22. 

They said that they defend the investigation of corruption schemes, however they said that the Lula government is the victim of a destabilization campaign. They blame the President of the United States George W. Bush for the crisis. They say that the government of Lula is victim of a coup attempt by Bush supporters.

Senator Heloísa Helena from the Socialism and Freedom Party (PSOL) said that the coup idea is nonsense. Other parliamentarians, even some of the Workers' Party, didn't agree with the coup argument. Some senators said that only the Wokers' Party itself initiated the crisis. Some senators who do not belong to the Brazilian ruling party PT warned of a scenario like the one in Venezuela where the President Hugo Chávez concentrated all political power on his hands using the support of social movements.
