The freed hostage Norman Kember arrived home earlier Saturday. In a prepared statement delivered at Heathrow Airport, he responded to earlier accusations that he was "not grateful" for the multinational effort culminating in his release.

"I do not believe that a lasting peace is achieved by armed force, but I pay tribute to their courage and thank those who played a part in my release."
