Citing a lack of results from the primary autopsy by the Los Angeles (LA) Coroner's Office of Michael Jackson's body, the Jackson family has requested that an independent coroner examine the body in hopes of finding the cause of death. 

The LA Coroner's have ruled out foul play, but the toxicological tests could take as long as 6 weeks, and as of now have not specified the reason for Jackson's death. The Coroner's officer has stated though the decision for an independent autopsy was surprising, they didn't have any issues with allowing it.

The Jackson family has been unable to contact Michael Jackson's personal physician, Conrad Murray, who was with the star during his final hours. Police have stated that Dr. Murray is not a suspect, but they are attempting to set up an interview. 

Reverend Jesse Jackson, an American civil rights activist and Baptist minister, has been in contact with the family and has been providing counseling. He stated "they [the Jacksons] didn't know the doctor...He should have met with the family, given them comfort on the last hours of their son." An associate of Ed Chernoff, Dr. Murray's lawyer, stated that "contrary to what has been out there, Dr. Murray has been co-operating with authorities from the outset and will continue to do so."
