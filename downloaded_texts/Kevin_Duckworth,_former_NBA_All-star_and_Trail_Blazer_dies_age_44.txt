Former American National Basketball Association (NBA) basketball star Kevin Duckworth has died at age 44. The former Portland Trail Blazers center died on Monday of an apparent heart attack in his hotel room at Gleneden Beach, Oregon. He was in town for part of a free childrens basketball clinic being run by the Trail Blazers. His death was confirmed by the Lincoln County Sheriff's Office.

Duckworth commenced his career with the San Antonio Spurs when he was selected in the second round of the 1986 NBA Draft. He was traded after one season for fellow draft pick Walter Berry. It was during his time with the Trail Blazers that he had his most successful season. During 1988 he shot 77.0% from the free throw line and played well all-round. This performance earned him the NBA Most Improved Player Award. 

The following year he was selected as an All-Star. The following seasons were also classed as a success for both Duckworth and the Trail Blazers. They made it to the 1990 NBA Finals and in 1991 he was selected as an All-Star for a second time. 

He was traded to the Washington Bullets for two seasons and then later for the Milwaukee Bucks and the Los Angeles Clippers for one seasons each. After the 1996-97 season with the Clippers he retired.
