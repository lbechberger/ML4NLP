The search engine giant Google is reportedly not accessible in some parts of China and Google services such as mail were down from Wednesday night to Thursday morning Beijing time. Google officials have not commented but said they were investigating reasons behind the outage. 

Recently Google has come under fire from the Chinese government for including "pornographic and vulgar" content in search results. “We have found that Google has spread a lot of pornographic content, which is a serious violation of Chinese laws and regulations," Mr Qin told reporters on Thursday.

China is also demanding all new computers starting July 1st be shipped with special new internet blocking software called “Green Dam Youth Escort” which filters out all pornographic content. United States officials are opposed to the idea and have expressed concerns it might cause China to be in violation of World Trade Organization rules.
