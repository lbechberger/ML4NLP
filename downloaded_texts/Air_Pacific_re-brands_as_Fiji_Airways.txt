Fiji's national airline Air Pacific has now officially returned to its original name: Fiji Airways. Fiji Airways adopted the Air Pacific name in 1971, slightly prior to its first international flight on June 3, 1973 . The re-brand was described by interim CEO Aubrey Swift as allowing the airline to align itself "closer with Fiji as a destination" . The name change is designed in part to reduce the confusion which surrounded the name Air Pacific. Swift noted that "Air Pacific just didn’t resonate with our customers" and said that same people "thought we were an air conditioning company". 

Along with the name change, the airline has redesigned its website, and changed the name of each of its classes of service. Pacific Voyager and Tabua Class have been replaced with economy and business class respectively. The airline has also introduced plans to overhaul its fleet of older Boeing 747s with Airbus A330s. It has said that the completion of this overhaul and the re-branding efforts will be completed by the end of the year .

The airline's new brand-mark and livery features a masi design created by Fijian artist, Makereta Matemosi. The new identity is to "symbolises the airline's new identity and epitomises all that Fiji Airways represents. It is authentic, distinctive, and true to the airline's Fijian roots”, the airline said .
