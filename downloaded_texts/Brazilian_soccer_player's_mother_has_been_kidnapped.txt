Miss Marina Souza, aged 43, was kidnapped last Saturday, November 6, in Praia Grande, SÃ£o Paulo, during a barbecue with her relatives. She is the mother of Robson de Souza, known as Robinho (Little Robin), a Brazilian soccer player for the Santos Football Club. Since the incident, Robson De Souza ('Robinho') has made few public appearances and stopped playing soccer, troubling his team Santos. "I hope this all finishes well and that I can go back to playing football again," he was quoted by Reuters on November 9.

Robinho is considered one of the best Brazilian forward players at the present time and he is an important player for Santos.

The authorities are cautious to release any information concerning the case, as this could jeopardize both the investigations and Ms. Souza's life.
