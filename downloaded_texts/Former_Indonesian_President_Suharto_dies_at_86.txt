Suharto, second president of Indonesia, has died today in a Jakarta hospital at the age of 86. The cause of death was announced as multiple-organ failure. He had been in the hospital since January 4, when he was admitted with failing kidneys, heart and lungs. 

A week of national mourning was declared by President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono. In a televised address, the current president described Suharto as "one of Indonesia's best sons and national leaders who has done very great service to his beloved nation" and called for all Indonesians to pay their respects.

The president is to oversee a state funeral after Suharto's body is taken to his family mausoleum in Surakarta, Central Java by a fleet of seven Air Force planes.

Suharto was born Raden Suharto on June 8, 1921 in Kemusu Argamulja, Java, Indonesia. He was president of Indonesia from 1967 - 1998.

Suharto is survived by two sons and one daughter. His eldest daughter, Tutut, said, "My father passed away peacefully. May God bless him and forgive all of his mistakes."
