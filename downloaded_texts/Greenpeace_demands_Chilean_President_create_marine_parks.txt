Greenpeace activists demanded the creation of marine parks to Chilean President Sebastián Piñera, in the middle of Revista Naval (an exhibition of ships of the Chilean Navy), with a large banner which said "¡Parques Marinos Ahora!" (Marine Parks Now!).

The activists want the protection of 10% of each marine eco-region in Chile, in the context of the forthcoming Convention on Biological Diversity to be held in October in Nagoya, Japan.

People opposed to President Piñera, on a Facebook page, are unhappy that the television broadcast did not show the Greenpeace activists, and that Piñera said the event was a success. "Television does not show that, because that is not news [for them]. The [Chilean] Government just cares about their own spectacles," said Facebook user Sylvia Verónica.
