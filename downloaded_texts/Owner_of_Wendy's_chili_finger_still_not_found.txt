Health officials in San Jose, California are still unable to identify the owner of the missing finger found in a bowl of chili at a local Wendy's restaurant last week. 

Fingerprints on the detached digit have been run through an FBI database as well as the local criminal database in Santa Clara County, but no matches were found. According to Rich Reneau, who is currently leading the investigation, the fingerprint was marginal, and the likelihood of finding a match is slim.

The finger is also undergoing DNA tests by the county medical examiner, which could determine the race and gender of the owner of said finger.

Plans for a toxicology lab to run tests on the finger to see if the tissue contains preservative chemicals, such as embalming compounds are underway.

According to Lt. Chris Forrester, the coroner may end up hiring a private lab to run further tests on the finger.

Wendy's International stock was trading at US$39.37 Tuesday morning, relatively unchanged from its levels last week, before the news hit the stock markets.
