Condoleezza Rice could become the first female African-American Secretary of State, after the Senate Foreign Relations Committee gave the go ahead yesterday. Full approval from the Senate is necessary before Rice can take the job.

Democrats have refused to waive the one-day delay between nomination and a Senate vote in order to analyse thoroughly Dr. Rice's testimony to the Foreign Relations Committee. The Senate vote is expected to take place next week.

Several Democratic senators posed tough challenges to Rice during the hearings.

"I'm worried about your lack of candor, and I'm giving you a chance to set the record straight," said Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-CA).
