The One: Making a Music Star is a new reality show hosted by CBC personality George Stroumboulopoulos.



The show airs on ABC and on CBC.

It premiered yesterday and has sparked some controversy over the simulcast, which according to ABC's schedule means displacing CBC's The National for a U.S. program.

Over the past few weeks, CBC's decision to simulcast The One has drawn criticism from a number of individuals and groups, including Friends of Canadian Broadcasting, NDP MP and federal heritage critic Charlie Angus, and a retired CBC journalist Knowlton Nash.
 

Since the show airs on Tuesday night, the episodes will bump The National to an earlier slot in Atlantic Canada and a later one in Ontario and QuÃ©bec, which means it will air at 11:00 PM instead of 10:00 PM in Ontario and in Quebec. The Wednesday night editions will also bump The National to an earlier slot in Ontario and Quebec.

A Canadian version of the series will launch in the fall in another time slot, but a condition of the CBC's franchise deal for this production was to simulcast the ABC production. This also represents the first time in over a decade that the CBC has scheduled an American-produced series in prime time.

The CBC's will continue to show The National at different times on the main broadcast network and on CBC Newsworld. "We get discouraged that people don't appreciate the fact that [The National] is on Newsworld. . . . People watch their news on the Internet, on cable, on broadcast and we're giving it to them in all different kinds of ways. We're very proud of The National. I just hope that gets across." , said Kirstine Layfield, CBC's executive director of network programming.
