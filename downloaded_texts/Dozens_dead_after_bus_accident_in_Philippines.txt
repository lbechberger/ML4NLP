According to reports, at least 35 people are dead while six are seriously injured in the northern Philippines after a bus plunged into a 100 meter deep ravine. The accident occurred early Wednesday near the city of Baguio, 200 kilometres north of the capital Manila.

The accident happened when the brakes on the vehicle failed and it rolled down a hill into a ditch. Officials say the death toll may increase. There were a total of 47 passengers on board.

The bus conductor, John Patrick Flores, survived the accident with only minor injuries by jumping out the door before the bus fell into the ravine. He said that "the driver tried to ram the bus into a mango tree to prevent it from falling, but failed."
