A warning has been sent out by Osama Bin Laden's lieutenant Ayman al-Zawahri saying that more attacks will be carried out because of Tony Blair's foreign policy decisions.

The comments were from a videotape shown on the satellite television channel al-Jazeera. The message said was: "Blair has brought you destruction to the heart of London, and he will bring more destruction, God willing."

Al-Zawahri also warned other nations to leave Muslim lands to avoid further violence. He was quoted as saying: "What you have seen, O Americans, in New York and Washington and the losses you are having in Afghanistan and Iraq, in spite of all the media blackout, are only the losses of the initial clashes, If you continue the same policy of aggression against Muslims, God willing, you will see the horror that will make you forget what you had seen in Vietnam." 

Tony Blair has denied that his policies caused the July 7 bomb attacks. Downing Street has refused to comment on the tape.

Police were on high alert today in London, with 6,000 officers watching for a repeat of the attacks two and four weeks ago and they continue to investigate the 7 July bombings and are holding 15 people in connection with the 21 July attempt.
