The body of missing student Ryan Katcher has been found in a truck at the bottom of a lake in Oakwood, Illinois. The 19 year-old, who attended the University of Illinois, went missing on 5 November, 2000 after a party.

Emergency workers found Katcher’s vehicle in about 50 feet of water almost 100 feet off shore in Clear Lake in Kickapoo State Park. They were testing new equipment at the time of the finding. “Basically, ESADE (Emergency Services and Disaster Agency) had purchased some new equipment and was experimenting with it,” a spokesperson said.

County Coroner Peggy Johnson said the black truck's good condition and the lake's cold water preserved Katcher’s body inside for when rescue crews made their discovery.

A spokeswoman for Ryan’s family issued a statement on behalf of his mother, Linda Katcher. "The search for Ryan is over, and she would like to thank everyone for their support and for never giving up. She appreciates everyone’s prayers."
