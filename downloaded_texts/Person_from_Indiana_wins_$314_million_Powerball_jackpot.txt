There was one ticket that matched all the numbers in last night's Powerball lottery game. The ticket was sold at the Speedway convenience store in eastern Indiana.

Lottery officials will not know who won the jackpot worth an estimated $314 million until the winner comes forward. The convenience store will receive $100,000 for selling the winning ticket.

Last night's winning numbers were: 8, 23, 29, 35 and the Powerball was 19.

Also sold in Indiana was a ticket matching five of the six numbers, earning $200,000. The jackpot grew so huge because there was not a winner since early June.

The Powerball lottery game is sold in 19 states. Wednesday's jackpot falls back down to $15 million.
