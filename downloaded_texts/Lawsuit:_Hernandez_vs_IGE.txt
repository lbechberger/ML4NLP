On May 31, 2007, C. Richard Newsome of the Newsome Law Firm, filed a class action lawsuit on behalf of Antonio Hernandez against IGE (Internet Gaming Entertainment). The main thrust of the lawsuit is that IGE made a "calculated decision to reap substantial profits by knowingly interfering with and substantially impairing the intended use and enjoyment associated with consumer agreements between Blizzard Entertainment and subscribers to its virtual world called World of Warcraft (WoW)."

Specifically, the lawsuit references IGE's practice of selling WoW items or WoW gold, generated by "farmers".

There is actually more than one IGE, both of whom are defendants in the lawsuit. IGE, LTD. is a "foreign corporation with its principal place of business in Hong Kong, China, with offices" "located at Euclid Avenue, Suite 222, Miami Beach, Florida, 33149" and "Beverly Hills, California." IGE U.S. LLC. is a "Delaware corporation with its principal place of business at 105 N.W. 43rd Street, Boca Raton, Florida, 33431." IGE U.S. LLC. is "an affiliated company" of IGE, LTD.

The lawsuit alleges that the amount in controversy exceeds US$5 million exclusive of interest and costs.
