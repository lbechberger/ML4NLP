Melbourne midfielder Tom Pondeljak scored the only goal for the match with a long range strike on sixty minutes.

Adelaide were reduced to ten men after ten minutes when Cristiano landed a clumsy elbow to the head of an opposing player. Melbourne was reduced to ten men twenty minutes from time when Danny Allsopp was sent off due to a late fracas.

"It was a great performance. Adelaide were great, they pushed us right to the death but I think we deserved it," Melbourne captain Kevin Muscat said. "Down to 10 men it was a very difficult game for us but the amount of courage and heart the boys showed tonight to get through the game and keep fighting to the end was fantastic. I couldn't ask any more."

"It's one of those things I guess, it changed the game, but what can you do about it now?" Adelaide Captain Travis Dodd told Fox Sports after the match. "We worked hard to keep it scoreless until half-time, to keep our discipline and keep our shape and keep doing what we were doing."
