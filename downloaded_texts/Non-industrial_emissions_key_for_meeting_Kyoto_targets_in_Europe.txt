The European Environment Agency (EEA) released a report which shows that the European Union is on track to meet their Kyoto Protocol commitments to limit and reduce emissions responsible for the greenhouse effect on our earth.

The five member states France, Germany, Greece, Sweden and the United Kingdom have already reached the target. All other member states, except Austria, which has to strengthen its efforts, expect to reach the target, too.

EEA Executive Director Professor Jacqueline McGlade said: "It is encouraging that Europe's climate-changing emissions are expected to continue decreasing, outperforming the objectives set by the Kyoto Protocol. Such an accomplishment should encourage all countries to agree on much larger reductions of global emissions, sealing a global deal in Copenhagen this December. Commitments to deep emission cuts are urgently needed to preserve our chances to keep planetary temperature increases below 2ÂºC."
