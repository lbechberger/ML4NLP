Joe Thornton had a goal and an assist, Evgeni Nabokov made 15 saves and the Sharks beat Vancouver 5-2 for their sixth victory in seven games, using their speed on two early goals and capitalizing on the Canucks' mistakes for the final two tallies.

Milan Michalek, Patrick Marleau and Joe Pavelski scored for the Sharks, who won consecutive home games for just the second time all season to stay in a first-place tie with Dallas in the Pacific Division, passing Vancouver for second place in the conference standings.

Despite a strong road record, San Jose won just five of its first 13 games at home, among the league's worst marks. Those woes appear to be fading, with the Sharks getting at least one point from six of their last eight games at the Shark Tank.
