Real estate tycoon Donald Trump on CNN's Anderson Cooper 360 reacted to Rosie O'Donnell's comments about him on the The View. 

"Rosie has some real problems," Trump said on Anderson Cooper 360. "Rosie's a loser. She's been a loser always."

It started when Miss USA Tara Conner was caught under age drinking. Trump, the owner of the Miss Universe Organization, gave her a second chance. Rosie O'Donnell called him a "Pimp" on her personal blog and said he has no right to be "the moral compass for 20-year-olds in America" on The View, which she co-hosts.

"Rosie got mentally beaten up by me," Trump told The Post yesterday, "because she's a mental midget, a low-life." 

"It's too bad a degenerate is able to get away with things like that," Trump said yesterday. "I met Tara the night of the pageant and didn't see her again until she got into trouble."

Trump said that he would sue her over her comment.

"It will never end on my behalf because I've exposed Rosie for what she is: a very dumb human being," Trump told the Associated Press. "She's got no intelligence, but I've known that for a long time. Unfortunately, Rosie's pulled the wool over the public."

When CNN contacted O'Donnell, one of her representatives said she was unavailable for comment. CNN's Anderson Cooper 360 also said that she is welcome to comment anytime.
