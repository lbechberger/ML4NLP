Following confirmation by Thailand's caretaker cabinet, a proposal to create a 77th province to honour the king's 80th birthday, will be the subject of a feasibility study.

King Bhumibol Adulyadej's 80th birthday next year follows on from the 60th anniversary of his accession to the throne earlier this year. The as-yet unnamed new province would likely consist of three districts and one sub-district surrounding the Klaikangvol Palace in Hua Hin. In addition to Hua Hin, Pran Buri and Sam Roi Yot districts from Prachuap Khiri Khan Province and Cha-am from Phetchaburi would make up the new province.

Currently the country consists of 75 provinces, it is expected that the 76th province will be around the Suvarnabhumi International Airport which opens in September 2006.
