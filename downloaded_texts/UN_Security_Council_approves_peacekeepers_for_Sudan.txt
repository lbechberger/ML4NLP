The United Nations Security Council approved the deployment of 10,000 peacekeeping troops and 715 civilian police to southern Sudan. They will monitor a peace plan that ended the country's 21 year long civil war.

The peacekeeping force will enforce a ceasefire agreement between Sudan's Khartoum government and the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA).

Jean-Marie Guehenno, head of UN peacekeeping operations, welcomed the Security Council's unanimous support of the resolution, but warned of "serious political hurdles" and "unprecedented logistical obstacles".

"If security does not improve quickly, the killings and rapes will continue. We must not allow allow this catastrophic scenario to become a foregone conclusion," he said.
