SciScoop, the online collaborative science news source, has changed ownership after two and a half years of operation under its previous webmaster, Ricky James. An earlier report by Wikinews that the site would be shut down was in error.

James cited lack of time as the reason to pass on ownership of the site, which specializes in breaking news in science and technology. The site has a growing membership and gets more than 30,000 hits a day.

SciScoop headlines are also carried on Slashdot and by the Google newsfeed. The site has a burgeoning archive containing hundreds of searchable news stories, providing visitors with an invaluable record of science news over the past few years. SciScoop also allows members to customise the layout of pages at their whim and add functions to their personal page, such as RSS newsfeeds.

The new owner and maintainer of the site is science writer David Bradley, who also operates the sciencebase science news site. Bradley is currently formulating a mission statement for the SciScoop site but has already said in a statement that, "The site is not going to disappear, nor is it going to change so radically that you won't recognise it."
