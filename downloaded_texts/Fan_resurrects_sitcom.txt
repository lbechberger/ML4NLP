A fan that set up his own company and bought the rights of his favourite sitcom has today released the DVD.

Craig Robins, 41, was so frustrated that Joking Apart, originally shown on BBC Two in 1993, had not been released that he secured the rights from the BBC and did it himself. As a video technician, he was able to produce the DVD, and has established a label to sell the product.

He is thought to be the first individual to have achieved such a feat.

Joking Apart was written by Steven Moffat, best known for writing Coupling and some episodes of the new Doctor Who. It is based upon the collapse of Moffat’s first marriage.

The show stars Robert Bathurst, who played David in Cold Feet, and Fiona Gillies, who appeared in Peak Practice. The cast members say that people who remember the show often approach them. Bathurst, Gillies, Moffat and co-star Tracie Bennett recorded interviews and a commentary for the disc in central London in January.

The disc, available from today, is being distributed via Robins’ website. He hopes to release further forgotten classics.

Moffat says: "I would be absolutely delighted if this was a success."
