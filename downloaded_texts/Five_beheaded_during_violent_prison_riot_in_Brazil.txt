Five prisoners were beheaded and got their heads exhibited by the rioters during a violent riot in the "Zwinglio Ferreira" Prison, located in Presidente Venceslau, SÃ£o Paulo State, Brazil.

This is the most serious riot of prisoners in the 19 year existence of the penitentiary. The rebellion began Tuesday, at 8:30 a.m. and it finished Wednesday at 2:30 p.m. Some heads belonging to the murdered prisoners were put on iron spears so they could be shown from the roof of the prison. Some prisoners played football with one of the heads. 

According to Nagashi Furukawa, the secretary of the administration of the prison, the rebellion originated because of prisoners who were contrary to the criminal organization Primeiro Comando da Capital (PCC). The supporters of PCC killed their opponents.
