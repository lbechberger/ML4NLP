United Airlines Flight 923 from London to Washington D.C. made an emergency landing at Boston's Logan International Airport following the pilot declaring an in-flight emergency.

The flight had 182 passengers and 12 crew members on board.

A spokesman for Logan International Airport, Phil Orlandella, said the flight was guided to Boston by two fighter jets. 

A 59-year-old woman from Vermont, evidently suffering from claustrophobia, created an on-board disturbance and had to be restrained by passengers.

The spokesman for United Airlines said that the pilot for the flight declared an in-flight emergency.

Massport spokesman says that the passengers were removed from the plane and their carry-on items were inspected.
