Australian Prime Minister John Howard began a visit of India yesterday. Interest in the visit has been dominated by the issue of uranium sales and Australia's stance on the recent agreement between the United States and India.

Before departing, Mr Howard gave an interview at Kirribilli House, in which he stressed the importance of Australia's relationship with India, and emphasised their economic significance. "India is one of the great coming powers of the world. The economic growth has been enormous. It's important that we do what we can to strengthen the economic relationship with India," he said.

This is Mr Howards second visit to India as Prime Minister. He will meet the Indian President, Prime Minister, and also Sonia Gandhi and others. The visit is expected to continue until Wednesday.
