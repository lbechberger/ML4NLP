A 6:00 p.m.-6:00 a.m. curfew was imposed in the Kyrgyz capital of Bishkek on Friday night as policemen and some 2,000 voluntary civilian militia members patrolled the streets. They were authorized to shoot into the air to disperse the looters.

Three to six people were killed as sporadic gunfire was heard in the capital overnight, and 129 people were detained.

Felix Kulov, newly appointed coordinator of law-enforcement, said of the situation on Friday, "The city looks as if it has gone mad."

However, after the night's events, he was confident that the situation had improved. "The situation is fully under control. We do not need a curfew," he said Saturday morning.

"Voluntary people's militia groups and units of the Kel-Kel opposition youth organization are responsible for maintaining order in the city," a source within the Interior Ministry told Interfax.

The opposition has now claimed that it did not originally intend to seize government buildings in Bishkek on March 24.

"On March 24 we didn't plan to seize the government headquarters in Bishkek, we were getting together for a peaceful rally. But when stones started flying at the rally, the people blew up and seized the Kyrgyzstan government headquarters," Rosa Otunbayeva, newly appointed minister of foreign affairs, told a news conference on Friday.
