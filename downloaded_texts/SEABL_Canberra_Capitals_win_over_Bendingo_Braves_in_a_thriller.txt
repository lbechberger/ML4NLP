The Canberra Capitals Academy won 71–68 against the Bendigo Braves Saturday in the Round 16 South East Australian Basketball League (SEABL) game at the Belconnen Basketball and Sports Centre. 

From a narrow half time lead of 36–35, the Capitals managed to extend their lead to 46–37 before Bendigo pegged them back to 48–47 at three quarter time. Not far into the final quarter, the scores were tied at 55 all. With a little over two minutes left, the score was 63–66. The Capitals' Michaela Dalgleish scored a three point shot to tie the score, but Bendigo's Renae Camino replied with a two point basket to make it 66–68. The Capitals' Mikaela Dombkins managed a three pointer, and was decked in the process. Sent to the free throw line, she converted one shot to make the score 70–68. With only twenty seconds left, instead of scoring, Bendigo fouled, sending the Captials' Alyce Shearing to the free throw line. She missed both shots, giving Bendigo one last chance. Bendigo attempted a three point shot to win the game, but turned the ball over, and drew another foul that sent the Capitals' Tessa Lavey to the free throw line. She scored one point. In the dying seconds of the game, Bendigo was unable to score, giving the Capitals a win.

With a median age of 19, the Capitals were somewhat younger than their opponents. Nonetheless, the team of Brianna Dalgleish, Michaela Dalgleish, Claire King, Abbie Davis, Tessa Lavey, Alyce Shearing, and Mikaela Dombkins conceded nothing in ball-handling skills.

The Capitals' next home game is against Ballarat Rush on July 28 at the Belconnen Basketball and Sports Centre.
