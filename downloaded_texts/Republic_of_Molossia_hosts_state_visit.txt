On April 22, President Kevin Baugh of the Republic of Molossia, a micronation located in Nevada, announced that his country hosted its first ever official state visit the day before.

Grand Duke Paul of the Grand Duchy of Greifenberg, another micronation, arrived in Molossia at 9:39 AM MST (Molossian Standard Time) on Monday. He spent much of the day with President Baugh discussing the current state of the intermicronational community, as well as the League of Small Nations, a near dormant organization dedicated to the prosperity of all land-claiming micronations.

Besides the meeting itself, President Baugh took Grand Duke Paul to nearby Virginia City, Nevada for lunch. Following this, both returned to Molossia where the meeting continued. The visit officially ended late in the afternoon. Some time later, Grand Duke Paul returned to Molossia for an informal dinner. He returned to his country the next day.

The Republic of Molossia and Grand Duchy of Greifenberg are not recognized by any major countries or international organizations. However, both are by other micronations.

In March, Wikinews held an interview with President Baugh.
