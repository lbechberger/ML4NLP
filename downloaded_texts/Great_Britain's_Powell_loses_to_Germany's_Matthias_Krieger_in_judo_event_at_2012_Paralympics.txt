London, England â€” Great Britain's Dan Powell was pinned by Germany's Matthias Krieger in his preliminary round of sixteen match in the men's 81kg judo event at London's ExCeL North Arena today. As Powell entered the arena, the British fans greeted him with loud applause. During the match, the competitors moved off the mat several times. At one point, a judge jumped from his chair and moved it to avoid the pair. The match had several delays as Powell first adjusted the tape on his feet. Later, the match was stopped again to address the tape on his feet. Krieger earned several points before securing his eventual victory for a score of 112-0. Going into the match, Powell's best performance was a second place finish at the 2009 Junior World Games. 

Krieger will advance to the quarter finals later today, while Powell's Paralympics run is over.
