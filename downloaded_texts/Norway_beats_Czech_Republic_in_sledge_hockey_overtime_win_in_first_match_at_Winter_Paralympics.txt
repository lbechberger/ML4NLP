In the first sledge hockey game of the 2014 Winter Paralympics held earlier today at Shayba Arena at Sochi's Coastal Village Olympic Park, Norway defeated the Czech Republic 2â€“1 in a shootout win. Norway's Audun Bakke scored the team's only goal in regulation time during the second period. The Czech Republic's Michal Geier scored the equalizer in the third period. Norway scored the only overtime shootout goal.

These Games are only the second ones that the Czech sledge hockey team have participated in, making their debut at the 2010 Winter Paralympics. In contrast, Norway has medalled at every Paralympic Games since the sport was added as a medal sport to the Paralympic program at the 1994 Winter Paralympics. They are the only country to have this accomplishment.

Norway is next scheduled to play Canada tomorrow, and then Sweden on March 11 to complete their games in group play. The Czech Republic is scheduled to play Sweden tomorrow and conclude group play against Canada on March 11.
