Barack Obama, the junior senator from Illinois and 2008 US presidential candidate has swept all three of today's Democratic contests, two caucuses in Nebraska and Washington and the primary in Louisiana. Obama also won the tiny United States territory of the United States Virgin Islands.

Obama won nearly 30% more over opponent Hillary Clinton in the Nebraska caucuses. Obama also had a major lead over Clinton in the Washington caucuses by a 2-1 margin. Commentators have noted that Obama seems to perform well in caucus states. 

Louisiana's Democratic primary was also won by Obama in a large margin, winning nearly 53% of the vote over Clinton's 39%. The state, which is still suffering from the effects of Hurricane Katrina three years later could play a large role in the election this year.

Despite these wins it is still a close and race between the two Democratic candidates, with Obama showing a lead in pledged delegates, and Hillary Clinton showing a narrow lead when super delegates are taken into account. Each candidate needs to win the support of 2,025 delegates to secure the nomination.

After the voting and caucusing ended yesterday both candidates gave a speech at the Democratic Party's Jefferson and Jackson Dinner in Virginia- Clinton giving her standard stump speech and refusing to talk about what had happened during the day; Obama repeating many of the things he had said earlier in his "Yes We Can" speech, this time with detailed policy proposals as well as "hope-mongering".

The two candidates were in Maine today doing last minute campaigning before tomorrow's Democratic caucuses there and are also preparing for the "Potomac primary" which will involve the nation's capital of Washington, D.C. and the bordering states of Maryland and Virginia to be held on February 12.
