Scottish tennis player Andy Murray has won the Montreal Masters event in Canada. Murray, who recently reached number two in the world, defeated Argentina's Juan Martin del Potro.

Murray lost the first set in a tie break after both men held each and every serve in the set. Del Potro had the early advantage in the second set, but this too required a tie break after reaching 6-6. Potro received treatment to his shoulder at this point but managed to return to the game. 

According to The Guardian, del Potro looked tired in the third set and this was ultimately won by Murray 6â€“1, giving the overall victory to the Scot. He is now set to head to the Cincinnati Open next week to defend his title from last year.
