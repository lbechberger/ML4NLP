An expedition guide working for the BBC has died after he was charged by an elephant in Tanzania on Friday. Anton Turner was helping with the filming of Serious Explorers for CBBC, a childrenâ€™s branch of the BBC, when the incident happened. Three children were with the group when the incident happened but were unharmed. Despite the help of a doctor travelling with the group, Turner died shortly after the attack. 

A spokeswoman for the BBC released a statement saying that "we would like to extend our deepest sympathy to Anton's family and friends. Anton was an extremely experienced expedition safari and wildlife ranger and former Army officer who had worked with the BBC in the past."

She added that an investigation had already begun into the death of Mr. Turner. "As is usual with a serious accident, an immediate and thorough BBC investigation into the circumstances of this incident has already begun."

A Foreign Aid spokeswoman confirmed the death of a British national in Tanzania. She added that his next of kin have been made aware.
