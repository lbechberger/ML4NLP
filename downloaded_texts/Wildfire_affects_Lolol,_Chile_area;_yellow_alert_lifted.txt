A wildfire affected eighteen hectares of scrubland, grassland and eucalyptus in the RanguilÃ­ area of Lolol, Chile.

Due to strong winds and climatic conditions in the area, as well as the imminent risk of it spreading to homes, the National Emergencies Office of the Ministry of the Interior (ONEMI) declared a red alert for the commune on Sunday. It was then decreased to yellow alert, until it was finally lifted on Tuesday, after the wildfire was extinguished.

Both Chile's National Early Warning Centre, and the O'Higgins Region ONEMI monitored the wildfire.

Lolol is a town located in the Colchagua Province of O'Higgins Region, in Chile. It is home to about 6,200 residents, and part of its urban center is considered a "Typical Zone" by the National Monuments Council.
