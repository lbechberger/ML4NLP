A lone gunman has shot and killed four in-laws at the Ministry of Jesus Christ church in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.

The suspect, identified as Anthony Bell (25), was arrested Sunday in a nearby apartment block close to the church. The suspect's wife, Erica Bell (24), was also shot and killed.

Bell abducted his wife and her three children during a Sunday morning church service. The children, one was an infant, were found unharmed. His relatives described Bell as having “domestic problems”.

It is unclear where the fatal shooting of Mr. Bell's wife occurred. The church pastor and mother to Erica Bell, Claudia Brown, was wounded during the rampage and was hospitalized in serious condition. 

Bell has been charged with five counts of murder, attempted murder, and kidnapping.
