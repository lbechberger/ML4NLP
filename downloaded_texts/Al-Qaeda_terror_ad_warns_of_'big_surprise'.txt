An advertisement for al-Qaeda, posted on the internet by the As-Sahab propaganda campaign for al-Qaeda, has warned of a "big surprise" by the terrorist group.

The ad reportedly shows digitally altered images of Pakistan's President, Pervez Musharraf, and the United States President, George W. Bush, in front of the White House in Washington, D.C., which happens to be on fire in the background and a U.S. presidential motorcade is also in the background. Images of Osama bin Laden and Ayman al Zawahri are also flashed across the advertisement.

The message then says "wait for the big surprise," but does not add anymore information. It ends with a simple "Soon -- God willing."
