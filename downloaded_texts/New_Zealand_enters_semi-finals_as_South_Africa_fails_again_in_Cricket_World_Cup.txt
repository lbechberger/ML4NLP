South Africa crashed out of the 2011 Cricket World Cup after being beaten by New Zealand in the quarterfinals, played at Mirpur, in Bangladesh. Chasing a victory target of 222, South Africa were all out for 172 after some inspired bowling performance by Jacob Oram and Nathan McCullum.

Earlier South Africa restricted the kiwis for 221 for the loss of 8 wickets. Afterward, Jesse Ryder top scored for NZ with 83 runs while Ross Taylor scored 43. Morne Morkel took three wickets while fast bowler Steyn and Spinner Imran Tahir took two wickets each.

South Africa collapsed from 121 for three wickets and lost the final seven wickets for 51 runs. McCullum, who opened the bowling for NZ, took three wickets while Oram took another four wickets and triggered a collapse.

NZ will now play either Srilanka or England in the semi-finals. India will take on Pakistan in the other semi-final.
