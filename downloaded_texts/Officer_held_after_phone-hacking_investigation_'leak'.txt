A Scotland Yard officer has been arrested after allegations he leaked information from the News of the World phone-hacking investigation to The Guardian. The 51-year-old detective constable was detained on suspicion of misconduct in a public office, and has been suspended by the Metropolitan Police.

Deputy Assistant Commissioner Sue Akers, head of the phone hacking inquiry, said "I made it very clear when I took on this investigation the need for operational and information security. It is hugely disappointing that this may not have been adhered to."

A spokesperson for Guardian News &amp; Media, which publishes The Guardian, declined to comment, saying, "We note the arrest of a Scotland Yard detective on suspicion of misconduct in a public office relating to unauthorized disclosure of information."

"In common with all news organizations we have no comment to make on the sources of our journalism."

Operation Weeting is investigating illegal hacking of voicemail messages by News of the World reporters. The Metropolitan Police said that all officers taking part in the operation had signed confidentiality agreements, and that a security review is underway.

The detective has been released on bail until September 29.
