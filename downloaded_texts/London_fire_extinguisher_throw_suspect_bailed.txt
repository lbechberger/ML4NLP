An 18-year-old UK student suspected of throwing a fire extinguisher from the roof of the headquarters of the Conservative Party ('Tories'), 30 Millbank, London, was arrested on Monday. He was today released on bail after a court appearance.

Edward Woollard, who is studying A-levels in Philosophy, Politics, and Classics, at Brockenhurst College in the New Forest, attended last Wednesday's student protests in London, before following a crowd of around 200 students into the Tory HQ and making it to the building's roof, whilst the rest of the building was vandalised. Watched by thousands of students gathered outside, a fire extinguisher was thrown from the roof, giving glancing blows to two police officers on the ground 70 feet (21 metres) below. Over sixty arrests have been made in conjunction with the protest.

The sixth-form student, who was wanted on suspicion of attempted murder earlier this week, handed himself in at his local police station and was taken to Belgravia police station for questioning. Today, he appeared at Westminster Magistrates' Court charged with violent disorder, speaking only to confirm his name age and address. His lawyer, Matthew Foot, sought adjournment to examine video evidence, and the trial was adjourned until 24 November. Until then, Woollard has been granted bail, on condition that he remains at his current address, and does not enter the City of Westminster.

Friends expressed shock at the arrest, and have created a supportive Facebook page. One fellow student described Woolard as the "most laid back, decent and nicest bloke" he had ever met; another wrote that "[Edward] has such a good heart and he would never intentionally hurt anyone."
