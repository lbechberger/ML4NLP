The 13 member larger bench of the Supreme Court of Pakistan reinstated Justice Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry as Chief Justice of Pakistan on Friday through a short order. The verdict was reached 10 to 3 in favor of Justice Chaudhry. 

Justice Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry through a panel of senior lawyers headed by Barrister Aitezaz Ahsan filed a constitutional petition challenging his suspension as Chief Justice of Pakistan by President General Pervez Musharraf on March 9 this year. Musharraf has indicated that he will accept the court's decision.

The Pakistani lawyer community hailed the decision of the court. The Peshsawar High Court Bar Association organized even organized a procession as a mark of celebrations.

Chaudhry, an opponent of Musharraf, had been accused of abuse of power but the charges were quashed by the court's decision, seen as a blow to Musharraf's government.
