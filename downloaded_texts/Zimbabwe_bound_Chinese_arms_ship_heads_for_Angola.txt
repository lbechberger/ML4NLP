The Chinese arms ship An Yue Jiang, bound for Zimbabwe, which was expelled from Durban Port in South Africa yesterday evening by the city's high court, is now said to be heading for Angola.

Paulo Zucula, Mozambique's Transport and Communications Minister, who has been following the ship's controversial journey, believes that the An Yue Jiang is now heading for Luanda, capital city of Angola. "We know that it registered its next destination as Luanda because here we wouldn't allow it into Mozambican waters without prior arrangements", he told Reuters earlier today.
