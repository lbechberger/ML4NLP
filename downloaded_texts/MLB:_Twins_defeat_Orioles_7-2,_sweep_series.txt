The Minnesota Twins swept the Baltimore Orioles in a 7-2 victory at the Metrodome Wednesday. RamÃ³n Ortiz made an impressive Twins debut, giving up only two runs in seven innings of play and picking up the win. This was the first time Minnesota has swept a series with the Orioles at home since they faced them in May 1994, and their first 3-0 start since 2003.

Baltimore pitcher Jaret Wright made his debut for the Orioles Wednesday, but he gave up six runs (four earned) and five walks in less than three innings. Oriole fielders were charged with three errors. This was the first time Baltimore has started the season 0-3 since 1995.

Twins got things started early, with Michael Cuddyer hitting in Nick Punto in both the first and third innings. Rondell White got his first hit of the season and picked up two RBIs. Luis Castillo, who hit in the Twins the winning run on Tuesday picked up two RBIs as well. In the fifth inning, Jason Kubel hit in Torii Hunter, making the score 7-0.

Baltimore attempted a rally in the sixth inning, Melvin Mora and Miguel Tejada hitting in a run each, but the pitching by Ortiz and the Twins' defense held them to only two runs.

Cuddyer left the game following the fourth inning after being hit by a bouncing foul ball in the chin. He was given five stitches and is expected to be ready to play on Friday when the team travels to Chicago to face the White Sox. Baltimore will head to New York to face the Yankees after their off day.

In the course of the game, reliever Joe Nathan became a father for a second time, his wife giving birth to his son Riley. Nathan, being allowed to miss the game, left the hospital shortly after the birth to attend the final inning. He was able to congratulate his team immediately following their win, while being congratulated himself.
