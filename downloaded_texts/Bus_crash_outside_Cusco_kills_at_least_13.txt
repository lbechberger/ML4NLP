A bus crash outside of Cusco, Peru has killed at least 13 people, police say. The bus hit a parked car as it was leaving Machu Picchu, outside the Incan city of Cusco. Cusco is one of the busiest archaeological tourist destinations in the world, which is the reason the tourists were visiting. The bus then swerved out of control and crashed sideways.

Among the dead are tourists from Bolivia, Chile, and the United States. In addition there are reportedly up to 28 people injured, including a Chilean man who had previously been reported as dead. According to the police, one of the buses was a flat bed truck modified to fit more passengers, which are illegal in Peru.
