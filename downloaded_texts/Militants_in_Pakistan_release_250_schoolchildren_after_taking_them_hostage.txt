Officials in Pakistan have confirmed that at least 250 schoolchildren between 12 and 18 years old and several teachers were taken hostage by at least seven militants inside a high school in Domail. After negotiations, the children were released.

"There were 200 to 250 children in the school and about seven militants," said Hamid Nawaz, the Interior Minister of Pakistan.

"The criminals have surrendered to the jirga along with their weapons. No children have been hurt and all have been released," said Javel Iqbal Cheema a spokesman for the Interior Ministry. At least one officer was injured and one militant was killed in the battle.

According to reports, the militants were fighting police officers after kidnapping a "health worker" when they ran into the school for shelter. They were allegedly armed with several weapons including rocket launchers and grenades.
