Yesterday, amid the celebration of the Argentinian Independence Day, snow and sleet surprised many in the greater area of Buenos Aires and other parts of Argentina. It was the first snowfall there since June 22, 1918. The National Weather Service even doubted to announce the predicted snowfall, because it is a phenomenon that occurs only about every hundred years.

"It's the first time that sleet falls here since the sixties, and it hasn't snowed since 1918 –I wasn't even born yet," said Diana Morinelli, a resident of the Olivos locality.

The snow fell mostly during the night and when the inhabitants of the capital city left their homes in the morning, many began to play with the snow. In 1918, the snowfall inspired composer Agustín Bardi's ¿Qué noche! (What a night!) tango.

Argentine daily La Nación reported that at least two homeless persons died because of the unusual cold. In Santa Rosa, La Pampa, the temperature was -10°C, with the perceived temperature as low as -15°C in some cities. Late May, the lowest temperatures in Buenos Aires in 40 years caused 23 deaths due to hypothermia, and an energy crisis.

The Argentinian version of Google decorated its main page with an Argentinian flag to celebrate the Independence day.
