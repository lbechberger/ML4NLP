Turkey has deployed short-range anti-aircraft missile batteries at the Syrian border. The deployment comes amid tensions following the shootdown of a Turkish military jet one week ago by Syrian forces.

Turkish television networks reported that a convoy of twelve military trucks moved towards the Syrian boarder. Late Wednesday, some 30 military vehicles, including heavy armor had moved and dispersed to bases along the 565-mile (900-kilometer) Turkish-Syrian border, said Turkey's state-run Anadolu news agency.

Turkey has given the rebel Free Syria Army (FSA) bases, and set up refugee camps for some 34,000 Syrians. Turkish TV broadcast an address by Prime Minister Recep Tayyip ErdoÄŸan on Friday in the eastern city of Erzurum: "We will not hesitate to teach a lesson to those who aim heavy weapons at their own people and at neighboring countries."
