Former Major League Baseball pitcher and coach Pat Dobson died of leukemia Wednesday, November 22. He died at age 64 at a local San Diego hospital only a day after being diagnosed with the disease. 

Dobson is best known for winning 20 games in the 1971 season for the Baltimore Orioles. He was a major league All-Star in 1972. Dobson finished his 11 year career with a career win-loss record of 122-129 and with a 3.54 ERA in eleven seasons. 

Dobson later became a pitching coach for several teams, last appearing for the Orioles in 1996. At his death he was a special assistant to San Francisco Giants general manager Brian Sabean, where he worked the past nine years.

Dobson is survived by his wife and six children.
