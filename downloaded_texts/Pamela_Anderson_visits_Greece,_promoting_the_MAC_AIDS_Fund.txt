The famous Baywatch star, Pamela Anderson, arrived today in Athens, Greece, taking part in the pan-European promotion of the MAC cosmetic products as well as in the fight against the sprawl of HIV (AIDS). Anderson held a press conference at a central Athens Hotel, during which a 30,000-Euro check issued by the MAC AIDS Fund was handed to Kentro Zois, a Greek non-profit organization. Later today, fans of Pamela Anderson would have the opportunity to meet her in downtown Athens, in the crowded Ermou street, in an organized appearance of the famous actress in a specific store. 

Accompanying the Hollywood actress in Athens is Peter Lichtenthal, MAC global general manager. Established in Toronto, Canada, in 1984, MAC soon flourished through cool combinations of recycling strategies and show-biz glitz. The famous Canadian-American actress is committed to the fight against HIV/AIDS, including working with children and supporting associations such as People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. MAC company's cosmetics are known for pushing the limits of the global beauty industry. The same happens when it comes to its efforts in fighting AIDS, for which the company is currently collaborating with Pamela Anderson, organizing a promotion-trip around Europe.
