Luciano Pavarotti, 71, a world-famous opera singer has been admitted to the hospital due to a high fever. The cause of the fever is currently unknown, however some reports say that he is being treated for pneumonia. His condition is being reported as stable.

"He [Pavarotti] is currently under observation and his condition is satisfactory," said a spokesman at the Modena University Polyclinic in Modena, Italy. He is reportedly being treated in the hospital's cancer ward and hallways have been blocked off and are being protected by private guards.

Pavarotti was admitted on Wednesday for observation, and the hospital states that he could be released "in the next few days." He was on vacation in Pesaro, staying at one of his homes when he fell ill.

Pavarotti had been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, and in 2006 underwent surgery to remove a cancerous mass. According to Nicoletta Mantovani, Pavarotti's wife, he has also been receiving radiation treatments.

"I can now say he is doing well. He's reacting well to a fifth cycle of radiotherapy. He's fighting like a lion and he has never lost his heart, also because a family he adores is by his side," said Mantovani.
