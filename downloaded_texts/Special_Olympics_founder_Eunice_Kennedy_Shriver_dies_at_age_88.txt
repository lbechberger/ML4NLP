Eunice Kennedy Shriver, the sister of former United States president John F. Kennedy, has died at the age of 88. Shriver's daughter Maria, the wife of California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, stated last year that her mother had suffered from a series of strokes.

"We have always been honored to share our mother with people of good will the world over who believe, as she did, that there is no limit to the human spirit. At this time of loss, we feel overwhelmed by the gifts of prayer and support poured out to us from so many who loved her. We are together in our belief that she is now in heaven, rejoicing with her family, enjoying the fruits of her faith, and still urging us onward to the challenges ahead. Her love will inspire us to faith and service always," said Shriver's family in a statement on her website.

Born in 1921 in Brookline, Massachusetts located in the U.S., she was the fifth of nine children of Joseph P. Kennedy, Sr. and Rose Kennedy (nÃ©e Fitzgerald).
 
Shriver was the founder of the Special Olympics. She also advocated for federal funding in the 1960's to help treat the mentally disabled.
