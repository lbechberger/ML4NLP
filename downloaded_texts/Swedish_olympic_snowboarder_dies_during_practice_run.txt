Swedish snowboarder Jonatan Johansson died Sunday during a practice run on Whiteface Mountain in the Adirondacks. Johansson, who competed in the snowboardcross in the Turin Olympics, was preparing for an upcoming World Cup competition.

Even though he collided with no obstacles upon his landing, autopsies reported that the rough fall caused several internal injuries. He was 26.
