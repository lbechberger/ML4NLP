Danish national goalkeeper Thomas Sørensen is ready to leave Aston Villa after four years with the club. Sørensen rules out extending his current contract with the club, saying: "It would be the strangest thing I have ever experienced. If Martin O'Neill called me and offered me a contract, I would not sign it. It is over." 


Currently, Thomas Sørensen is home in Denmark for friendlies against the Netherlands and Poland next week. 

Speaking to Danish Ritzau, Sørensen said: "We are in talks with several clubs. So that's positive. I am not nervous about finding a suitable club before the next season." Sørensen declined to mention any specific club names.

This will mark the end of four years at Aston Villa, while Thomas Sørensen might not have wanted the last year, as he did not play a single match this season.

Even though Sørensen, through his agent, said he would decline an offer from Ipswich Town F.C.,Those Were The Days reports that the Championship League club may seek to recruit Sørensen. Sources predict that he will wind up with a Premier League team or return to Denmark to play for F.C. København.
