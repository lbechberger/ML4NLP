General Nebojsa Pavkovic, a commander during the 1998-1999 Kosovo conflict, is set to turn himself over to the UN Tribunal in The Hague . During the conflict thousands of ethnic Albanians were slaughtered by the Serbian Armed Forces. In a statement provided by the Serbian Government, Pavkovic plans to fly to the International Criminal Tribunal Monday to face charges. His choice to surrender is apparently voluntary.

On April 12, a EU report recommended a start in talks for the eventual membership of Serbia into the union by forming a Stabilisation and Association Agreement. But EU ministers would back the proposal only if the key fugitive Pavkovic surrendered.

He would be the 12th war crimes suspect to go to The Hague this year.
