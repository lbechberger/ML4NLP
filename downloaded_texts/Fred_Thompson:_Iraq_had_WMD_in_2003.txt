In October United States Presidential candidate for 2008 Fred Thompson said about Iraq, "We can't forget the fact that although at a particular point in time we never found any WMD down there he clearly had had WMD." 

However, the several different investigations, including the Iraq Survey Group headed by Charles Duelfer concluded, in part, that "The ISG has not found evidence that Saddam possessed WMD stocks in 2003..." Shortly after in October 2004 President George W. Bush said, "Charles Duelfer has now issued a comprehensive report that confirms the earlier conclusion of David Kay that Iraq did not have the weapons that our intelligence believed were there."
