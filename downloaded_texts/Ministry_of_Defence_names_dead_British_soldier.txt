The British Ministry of Defence named the soldier who was killed in Afghanistan yesterday. He was Lance Cpl. Jonathan Hetherington and was shot dead by insurgents during an attack on his platoon residence in Musa Qaleh, northern Helmand.

The 22-year-old joined the army in September 2000. During his career he served in Germany, Kuwait, Iraq and the Falkland Islands. He was dispatched to Afghanistan this year.

His commanding officer, Lt. Col, Steve Vickery, said: "Lance Corporal Jon Hetherington had only been in Afghanistan for a short time. In this period his commitment to his profession was first-class and he stood out as a young man of stature and great enthusiasm. He was a very bright junior non-commissioned officer who had integrated extremely well into regimental life since his arrival in February of this year." He also said that Lance Cpl. Hetherington was "an outstanding soldier, trusted comrade and valued friend."

Defence Secretary Des Browne said yesterday: "The sad newsâ€¦ has reminded us of the challenges we face in Afghanistan. We are there as part of the Nato mission to help rid Afghanistan of these terrorists and provide security to help rebuild." 

He is the eighth British soldier to have died in Afghanistan this month. Since military operations began in November 2001, 21 British soldiers have died.
