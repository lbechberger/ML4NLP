Former champion Maria Sharapova of Russia saw her comeback attempt come to an early end, as Argentina's Gisela Dulko beat her, 6-2, 3-6, 6-4. Dulko faces 10th-seeded Nadia Petrova in the third round, after the Russian beat Shahar Peer of Israel, 6-3, 6-2.

Second-seeds Roger Federer of Switzerland and Serena Williams of the United States have advanced to the third round of the Wimbledon tennis championships in London.

Williams took advantage of her big serve and powerful groundstrokes Wednesday as she dominated Australia's Jarmila Groth, 6-2, 6-1. Federer eliminated Spain's Guillermo GarcÃ­a-Lopez, 6-2, 6-2, 6-4.

Federer is trying to pass American Pete Sampras as the sport's most successful major tournament winner by capturing his 15th Grand Slam title.
