Jackass started in 2000 after a series of internet clips were released showing Dunn skateboarding and performing stunts along with Margera, Christopher Raab and Brandon DiCamillo. The show was created after Johnny Knoxville contacted the group to ask if he could use their videos on the show.

As well as the TV series and three Jackass movies, Dunn also appeared on Viva La Bam and presented his own shows, Homewrecker and Proving Ground.
