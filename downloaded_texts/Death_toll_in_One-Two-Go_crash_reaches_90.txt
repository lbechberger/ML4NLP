A Welsh woman has died in a Thai hospital from injuries sustained in the September 16 crash of One-Two-GO Airlines Flight 269 at Phuket International Airport, bringing the death toll to 90.

Bethan Jones, 22, from Porth, had been one of 42 original survivors in the crash, which her boyfriend, Alex Collins, 22, did not survive. They were three days into a round-the-world trip when the crash occurred.

Jones, whose family flew to Thailand in order to be with her, never regained consciousness after the crash, which left her in critical condition with burns across more than 50% of her body. Two days after the crash a military aircraft had flown her to a specialist unit at the Bangkok General Hospital for treatment.

Her family released a statement in which they thanked family, friends and "the community of Porth and Rhondda and all Bethan's friends and work colleagues for their kindness and sympathy".

Bethan's body will be flown home this weekend. Alex's body is already in Wales, and his funeral is scheduled for Monday.
