Satellite Information Services Limited (SIS), the racecourse television company part-owned by William Hill (19%) and Ladbrokes (23%), has been named by the BBC as the preferred bidder for its Outside Broadcasts division, one of three active businesses within BBC Resources Ltd. Other SIS shareholders include, Thales (Racal) (23%), United Business Media (19%), Racecourse Association (10%) and the Tote (6% - all figures rounded).

SIS Chief Executive David Holdgate would not comment on the terms of the deal, thought to be between £20m and £50m, but said it would be "an ideal acquisition for SIS" and "a perfect fit with our existing SISLink and sports coverage". The company has long-term contracts with other leading broadcasters, such as Sky and ITV and provides satellite links for live sport and news.

In a statement, the BBC said that it intended to exchange contracts and transfer the Outside Broadcasts business and around 300 staff in the near future, with Andrew Thornton, BBC project director for the sale of the division, saying that "SIS offered the BBC a good deal and best value for licence fee payers". Mark Tugwell, Director, BBC Outside Broadcasts, added "it's time for our business to flourish under new ownership, without the constraints of BBC ownership".

The transfer would mean that SIS will be covering major sporting events including the Beijing Olympics for the BBC in August 2008.
