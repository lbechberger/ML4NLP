This weekend the fifth Grand Prix weekend of the Formula 1 season, the Grand Prix of Europe, took place in Germany on the Nürburgring track. Unlike the previous race, Michael Schumacher was only second on the grid after qualifying on Saturday, losing out the pole position to Fernando Alonso, the first Renault pilot. However, in the last part of the race, "Schumi" outpaced Alonso on the track and took the lead thanks to some fast laps with the track free of traffic while Alonso took his final pitstop. The German passed the checkered flag and won for the 86th time in his Formula 1 career.

In spite of his second "defeat", Fernando Alonso stands in the lead of the drivers championship, 13 points ahead his closest competitor, Michael Schumacher.

Felipe Massa, the second Ferrari driver, was third. This achievement is the first podium of his Formula 1 career. 

Kimi Räikkönen struggled with the car this weekend, but ended up finishing the weekend with a fourth place. Kimi pushed hard on the closing laps and closed the gap to Felipe Massa to +0.4 seconds upon crossing the finish line.

Nico Rosberg, the "discovery of the season", had a nice race for the Williams Formula 1 team. He finished 7th.
