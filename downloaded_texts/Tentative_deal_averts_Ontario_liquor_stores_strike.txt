The Liquor Control Board of Ontario, Canada, reached a tentative agreement with its union one day before some 5,400 unionized employees were to walk off the job at roughly 600 LCBO outlets across the province. The Ontario Public Service Employees Union said it received a commitment that the provincially run liquor stores would not be sold, which was the main issue. Last week, workers voted 84 per cent against the latest contract offer from the LCBO, which called for raises of 11 per cent over four years to full-time staff.
