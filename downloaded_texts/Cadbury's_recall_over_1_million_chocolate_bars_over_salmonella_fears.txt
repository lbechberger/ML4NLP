The British confectioner Cadbury's has recalled over one million chocolate bars from retailers in the UK and Ireland over fears that they may be affected by salmonella. The company is stressing that it is only a precautionary measure, and that customers should not be concerned if they have eaten one of the bars. 

The bars affected are the Dairy Milk Turkish 250g, Dairy Milk Caramel, Dairy Milk Mint bars, Dairy Milk 8 chunk, Dairy Milk 1kg bar, Dairy Milk Buttons Easter Egg 105g and 10p Freddo bar. Uneaten products can be returned to 'Cadbury Recall, Freepost MID20061, Birmingham B3O 2QZ', and then a full refund will be given. Customers can also call 0800 818181 if they are concerned.

Cadbury has said that it expects to have fresh stocks of the products back on the market in the near future. 

The decision was made in consultation with the Food Standards Agency.
