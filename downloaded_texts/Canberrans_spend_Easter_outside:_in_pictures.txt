Despite an overcast start to Easter in the Australian Capital Territory, today's weather cleared with the sun coming out by mid-afternoon and the temperature getting up to 21°C (70°F). A number of Canberrans took the opportunity to spend the day outside alongside Lake Ginninderra in Belconnen. People, including a number of families, played soccer and Australian rules football, fished, sailed and did other activities on the water, flew kites, barbecued and picnicked, walked their dogs, bicycled and utilized the skate park. While most shops were closed, a few lakeside eateries, including the Light House Water Front Pub and Subway, were open and had a number of customers.
