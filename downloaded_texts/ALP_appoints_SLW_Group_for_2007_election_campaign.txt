The Australian Labor Party has appointed SLW Group to run it's advertisement campaign for the 2007 Australian Legislative Election.

STW Group was successul in gaining the $10 million account it was revealed today. The team dubbed "07" will be lead by senior executives, Luke Dunkerley and Neil Lawrence.

ALP campaign director Tim Gartell said that Lawrence had a wealth of experience with political campaigns, being part of the adveritsement team responsible for the election of a Victorian Labor government in the 1980s. He also added that Lawrence had worked on the campaign for election of Australian Republican Movement representatives to the Australian Constitutional Convention in 1998.

Present polling data from Newspoll suggests that the ALP is beginning to regain support in the electorate, narrowly polling a higher percentage of primary support since late October, 2005, ending almost 10 months of being behind John Howard's coalition government in polling.
