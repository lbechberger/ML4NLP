New legislation introduced in the New York State Senate today would effectively ban the use of all electronic devices on the streets of New York City and Buffalo.

Senator Carl Kruger (D-Brooklyn) has plans to introduce the bill to the State Senate floor. The legislation would ban the use of any electronic device while crossing a street. The impetus for the legislation is the recent deaths of three people in Brooklyn and Manhattan, all of which were attributed to the distraction caused by the use of electronic devices.
