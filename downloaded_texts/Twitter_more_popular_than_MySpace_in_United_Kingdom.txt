Social networking website Twitter picked up 1 in every 400 UK Internet visits last week and had more viewer visits than rival site MySpace. 

Hitwise, an Internet research company, provided the information. They said: "For the week ending August 29th 2009, Twitter.com picked up 1 in every 400 UK Internet visits and ranked as the 27th most visited website in the UK, one position above MySpace."

Robin Goad, researching director of Hitwise, said: "Twitter is probably even more popular than the figures suggest as many Twitter users access the site through their mobile phones and third party applications than visit the site's home page." 

Twitter has gained popularity over the course of this year due to an upsurge in celebrities using the website like Stephen Fry, Johnathan Ross, John Cleese, Lily Allen, Chris Moyles and Calvin Harris. The social networking hotspot started in 2006, whereas MySpace started three years earlier.
