Three people who were found with €440 million worth of cocaine have been given a total of 85 years imprisonment. Perry Wharrie and Martin Wanden were given thirty years imprisonment, while Joe Daly was given twenty-five. 

The trio were involved in a cocaine smuggling operation which took place near Cork, a region of the Republic of Ireland.

According to evidence heard by the court, Perry Wharrie, an Essex, England resident, was given a life sentence in 1985 for murdering a police officer.

Judge Ó Donnabháin made the following comment when sentencing the group:



Gerard Hagan, from Liverpool, England, a person who was involved with the group, pleaded guilty at the start of the trial. He said that he was in possession of €13,000 worth of drugs, and intended to sell them.
