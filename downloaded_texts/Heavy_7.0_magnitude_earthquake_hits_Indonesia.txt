A heavy earthquake with a magnitude of 7.0 struck deep underwater off the eastern shores of Indonesia on Saturday, officials said.

According to the US Geological Survey, the earthquake's epicentre was located 365 kilometers into the Banda Sea, southeast of Ambon Island in the Maluku Islands.

Many people rushed to higher ground following the earthquake, fearing that a tsunami was generated, but the Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre said the quake was too deep below the surface to cause any waves. A tsunami alert was initially issued by Indonesia, but it was soon lifted.

The earthquake comes as Indonesia is still recovering from a powerful tremor that struck the area last month, which killed over a thousand people in western Sumatra.
