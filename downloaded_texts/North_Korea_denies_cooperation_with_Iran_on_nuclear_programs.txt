The North Korean government has denied reports in the press that the country is working with Iran to better their nuclear programs and said that the press is spreading "lies" in an attempt to ruin the country's reputation.

Earlier this week, media outlets began to report that North Korea was attempting to help Iran test their own nuclear weapon underground and that Iran was preparing for that test.

"The Iranians are working closely with the North Koreans to study the results of last year's North Korean nuclear bomb test. All the indications are that the Iranians are working hard to prepare for their own underground nuclear test," said an unnamed European dilpomat on January 24, 2007.

North Korea immediately denied all reports that any cooperation between the two countries, in regards to nuclear material, was taking place.

"[The] assertion is nothing but a sheer lie and fabrication intended to tarnish the image of (North Korea) by charging it with nuclear proliferation," said a statement issued by the Foreign Ministry of N. Korea.

"[North Korea] will continue to sincerely honor its duty it had assumed before the international community in the field of nuclear nonproliferation as a responsible nuclear weapons state," added the statement.

The International Atomic Energy Agency has also denied that there is any evidence to suggest that Iran and North Korea are working together to better their nuclear programs.

The United States, however, has stated in the past that N. Korea and Iran helped each other with missile programs, but that it is not known if they are cooperating in other areas of study.

"Whether that cooperation has extended into other areas, I don't have any information for you," said Sean McCormack, a spokesman for the U.S. Department of State.
