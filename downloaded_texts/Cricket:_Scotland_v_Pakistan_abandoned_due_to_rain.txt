The One-Day International cricket match between Pakistan and Scotland at Grange Cricket Club Ground, Edinburgh, Scotland was called off due to rain.

Due to a waterlogged field caused by overnight rain, and a poor weather forecast for the rest of the day, the match was first delayed from a 10:45 BST start and then abandoned after a pitch inspection at 12:00.

Roddy Smith, chief executive of Cricket Scotland, said "It's disappointing to lose the chance to play against a full member country".

Scotland is an associate member of the ICC, awarded ODI status until 2009 by qualifying for the semi-finals of the 2005 ICC Trophy.

The match was the only ODI that Pakistan would have played against the hosts in the brief tour. Pakistan will play an ODI against India at Titwood, Glasgow, Scotland on Tuesday, while Scotland will play an ODI against India in August during the latter's tour of England.

In 2005, an ODI between Scotland and Australia was also abandoned because of rain.
