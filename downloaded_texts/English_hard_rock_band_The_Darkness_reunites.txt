The Darkness, a musical group of the hard rock genre based in England, has made the decision to reunite. They have been separated since 2006. 

The group are reportedly to perform at the upcoming Download Festival, which is due to occur in June of this year. The four members are anticipated to proceed recording a new album during the months of April and May 2011.

Speaking on Twitter, Justin Hawkins, a singer in the group, expressed his "[t]hanks for all the lovely messages of support" from supporters. "I'm gobsmacked and overwhelmed by all the positivity in and around The Darkness," he said.

Approximately four years ago, Justin Hawkins departed from The Darkness. In a statement, the reaction of the remainder of the group was one of "total shock". They subsequently separated until this reforming occurred. Speaking to Newsbeat about the music group, Hawkins explained that "[t]he main thing for us is to make sure that musically we turn the experience into something positive again."

"We've been remembering why it was so much fun in the first place, just four men making loud music in a room," Hawkins commented. Speaking about the bodysuits he was known for wearing, Hawkins also said that "I think it should be a new phase and that should be extended to the clothing. Not a lesser phase, if anything a cranked up version. They'll be more good."
