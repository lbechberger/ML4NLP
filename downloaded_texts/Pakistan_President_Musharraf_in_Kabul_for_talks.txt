The President of Pakistan, Pervez Musharraf is in Kabul for a two-day visit during which he is scheduled to hold talks with his Afghan counterpart, Hamid Karzai. The talks are expected to focus on the continuing militant activity on both sides of the border, with Taliban forces allegedly infiltrating into Afghanistan from across the border in Pakistan. 

Economic cooperation and reconstruction in Afghanistan are also on the agenda. President Musharraf is scheduled to meet cabinet ministers and address parliamentarians tomorrow. His delegation includes ministers for foreign and religious affairs and the petroleum sector, and the head of Pakistan's intelligence agency.

"Frank discussions on the war on terror and expanding bilateral cooperation on regional issues," read a statement by President Karzai's office. 

Pakistan foreign office spokeswoman Tasnim Aslam told AFP news agency that the Presidents "will exchange views on bilateral relations, economic cooperation, reconstruction activities in Afghanistan and cooperation in the fight against terrorism," 

"Afghanistan is expecting the Islamic Republic of Pakistan to take effective action against terrorism," Afghan Foreign Ministry spokesman Sultan Ahmad Baheen said.
