Israel fired a missile into northern Gaza Strip, killing one person and wounding two. The Israeli army claimed it targeted militants placing explosives in an area close to Israeli troops.

Palestinian security sources also said the Islamic University, a Hamas stronghold, in Gaza city were hit with no word of any casualties.

The strikes were a part of an Israeli operation in Gaza to rescue Gilad Shalit, an Israeli soldier kidnapped earlier by Palestinian militants.
