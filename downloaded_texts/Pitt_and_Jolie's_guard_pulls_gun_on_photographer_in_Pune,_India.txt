A private security guard attached to Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie pulled out his revolver to threaten a lensman in Pune, India. The Associated Press photographer was also roughed up by the guard, Sunil Singh, who works for Tops Securities. Defamer.com, a tabloid in Los Angeles, however, says that two guards were involved in the attack. The incident occurred at the Sindh Society area in the suburb of Aundh. 

A spokesperson for Tops confirmed the incident, although he claimed the weapon had been pulled out in "self-defence". The accosted person himself chose to remain anonymous and refused to comment on the issue. Freelance photographer Rishikesh Puranik, who witnessed the scene, said that the AP lensman had approached Angelina Jolie with a request for a photo-shoot while she was on the sets. Jolie and her partner Brad Pitt are in India to shoot for A Mighty Heart, a film based on Daniel Pearl, a journalist who was killed in 2002 while in Karachi, Pakistan.
