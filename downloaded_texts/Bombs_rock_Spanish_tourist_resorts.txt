Four bombs blasted at popular seaside resorts in northern Spain on Sunday. There were no injuries reported. The blasts were preceded by the warning of the Basque separatist group ETA, which allowed the police to evacuate the nearby area.

Previously, a first homemade bomb blasted in a bank in the Basque town of Getxo. Five hours later, a warning call was received in the Basque fire service telling that four bombs were planted on the beaches of Laredo and Noja, in the northern Spanish province of Cantabria. 

The four bombs exploded between 1100 (1000 GMT) and 1400. There were no injuries because the police had evacuated the area. One woman was treated for shock.

ETA has routinely targeted tourist destinations in northern Spain during summer months.
