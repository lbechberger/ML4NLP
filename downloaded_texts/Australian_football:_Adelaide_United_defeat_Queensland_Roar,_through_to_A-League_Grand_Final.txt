Adelaide United will play in the A-League football preliminary final Queensland Roar in Adelaide on Saturday night. In a top four finals series, which the A-League uses, the preliminary final is a final played between the qualifying Semi Final (1st vs. 2nd) and the winner of the elimination Semi Final (3rd vs. 4th) for the remaining spot in the Grand Final.

Adelaide qualified after losing to Melbourne Victory in the major semi final. Queensland qualified after winning the minor semi final against the Central Coast Mariners.

Adelaide United opened the scoring at the 25 minute mark through midfielder Fabian Barbiero. Barbiero's shot, which sailed into the top lefthand corner of goal, came from just outside the 18 yard box off to the right of the goals.

"I thought we were most probably the better team but we were beaten by a wonder strike, it was a fantastic strike," said Queensland coach Frank Farina.

Queensland rallied in the second half and continually took shots on goal. However, an indifferent Adelaide kept them out. Serginho Van Dijk fired some inaccurate shots while Mitch Nichols had a low trajectory shot saved by Adelaide keeper Eugene Galekovic.

"That's the biggest disappointment. The grand final's not a disappointment, to be totally honest," Farina said. "It's not qualifying for Asia, that was the biggest prize tonight. It's disappointing, but if we keep this current squad together it'll happen. We'll get to Asia and we'll get to a grand final."

Adelaide will now play Melbourne Victory in the Grand Final at the Telstra Dome.
