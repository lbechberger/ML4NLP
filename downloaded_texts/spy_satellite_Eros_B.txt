ImageSat International, the Israeli company that operates the recently launched photo/spy satellite Eros B, published its first photographs of potential targets in the Middle East. Analysts say the timing of this announcement shows that Israel intends to carefully monitor Iran's nuclear facilities to assess the threat for Israeli security. The dual-use satellite, second in the EROS series, can observe small details on the ground at very high resolution. 

Israelis commemorate today those who have fallen in military service and in terror attacks since the UN resolution on the establishment of the state in November 29, 1947. Israeli Chief of Staff, Major General Dan Halutz, said that the threat from Iran shows that Israel must be strong to defend its people.
