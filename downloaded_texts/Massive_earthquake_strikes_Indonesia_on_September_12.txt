According to the United States Geological Survey (USGS), a massive earthquake with a magnitude of 8.4 has struck Indonesia and a tsunami is reported to have been generated. Some smaller aftershocks with magnitudes between 5.2 and 5.7 were also reported in the region. At least four have been killed and dozens injured.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has issued a tsunami warning saying that the quake had the potential to "generate a widespread destructive tsunami that can affect coastlines across the entire Indian Ocean."

"Sea level readings indicate a tsunami was generated. It may have been destructive along some coasts. Based on these data, the threat continues for all coastal areas of the Indian Ocean," said the NOAA tsunami warning.

The earthquake was recorded at 6:10 p.m. (local time), 130 kilometers (80 miles) southwest of Bengkulu, Sumatra, Indonesia with a depth of 30 kilometers (18.6 miles) and the USGS states that damage could be "moderate to heavy." 

Reports say that buildings shook heavily in Jakarta and that the quake could be felt as far away as Singapore and Thailand.
