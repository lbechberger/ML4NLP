Tensions have started to rise again between the United States and North Korea. North Korea claims that the United States have planned to start an atomic war against them due to President Barack Obama recently reaffirming the nuclear protection of South Korea. 

A South Korean Foreign Ministry official on Saturday stated that Seoul has proposed five-way talks with the U.S., China, Russia and Japan to find a way to deal with the threats given by North Korea. The United States and Japan agreed to attend the 5-way talks but China and Russia have yet to respond.

Singapore has stated that if the Korean flagship the Kang Nam is carrying a weapon that is in violation of the United Nations sanctions it would take immediate action. According to a senior member of the United States military, the USS John McCain is ready to intercept the Kang Nam.
