London, England â€” 
With the 2012 Summer Paralympics due to start in London later this week, Algeria's athletics competitors are ready to earn medals in their events.

According to the team's athletics coaches in a conversation with Wikinews, the runners have been well prepared and have international experience that has prepared them for the Games, having won eleven medals at the 2011 IPC World Championships, eight of which were gold. The coaches believe their runners should easily defeat their African counterparts from Nigeria and Kenya.

The team is comprised of 17 male competitors and six female competitors. Athletics events commence on Thursday.
