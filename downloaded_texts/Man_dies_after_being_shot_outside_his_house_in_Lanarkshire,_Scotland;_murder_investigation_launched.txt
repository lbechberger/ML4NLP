A man has died after he was shot outside his house in Lanarkshire, Scotland, United Kingdom. Anthony Wright, aged 35, was shot outside his household in the rural town of Shotts at approximately 0700 BST (0800 UTC) on Wednesday.

Police think that Wright, who was shot twice, was the anticipated target. An ambulance then transported him to Wishaw General Hospital; he died in the hospital later that day.

A murder investigation has begun outside Wright's house. A completed report is expected to be submitted to the Procurator Fiscal later on. No other injuries were reported as a result of this incident occurring. 

A description of the suspect's appearance has not been disclosed by the police. The police have not offered any motive for the crime. Reports say that the suspect left the crime scene on foot, going across some wasteland; he was last sighted at the rear of Inverkip Drive. One nearby resident, who is remaining unidentified, commented about Wright: "We don't know the man well but he had a boy at the high school and three wee tots. It's shocking really."

Detective Superintendent John McSporran stated on Wednesday, "Extensive door-to-door enquiries are ongoing and I would appeal once again to anyone who was in the Inverkip Drive area at that time to come forward. Officers from the enquiry team are also keen to talk to anyone who may have seen the suspect heading towards wasteground at the back of Inverkip Drive."

McSporran urged individuals who know about the incident to speak with law enforcement, "I would ask members of the public who have not yet come forward and know something about this crime, to speak to police as a matter of urgency. I have no doubt that there are people out there who know who was involved in this crime and who may have reservations about coming forward. I would urge them to do so without delay as it is vital that the killer is arrested and brought to justice."
