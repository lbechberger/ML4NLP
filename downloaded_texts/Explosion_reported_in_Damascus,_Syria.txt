According to eye witness reports on Twitter, confirmed by the Arabic news network Al Arabiya, "a huge explosion rock[ed] [a] neighborhood in Damascus," Syria as rebel troops fought with the Syrian army. Forces on both sides battled in neighborhoods around Damascus for nearly twelve hours on Saturday night.

The explosion reported occurred just before 2:00 a.m. local time in the Mydan neighborhood of Damascus. A video posted to the video sharing website YouTube allegedly shows a large explosion, followed by a loud boom, then smoke rising from its location. No injuries or fatalities were reported. The cause is not known, but rebel fighters launched rocket propelled grenades into a power facility causing severe damage to it and surrounding buildings. 

In battles elsewhere on Saturday night, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reports at least 20 civilians were killed in the city of Daraa by Syrian army tank shells.
