A small twin engine Beechcraft King Air A-100 plane has crashed in Southeastern Utah near Arches National Park killing all 10 people aboard. The plane crashed shortly after takeoff from Canyonlands Field airport at around 5:55 p.m. (mountain time) on Friday evening.

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is currently investigating the cause of the crash. According to James Nyland of the Grand County Sheriff's department, there was no bad weather and winds were minimal when the plane crashed and burst into flames two miles from the airport.

The nine passengers were part of a group of dermatologists from Cedar City. The director of Red Canyon Aesthetics &amp; Medical Spa, Dr. Lansing Ellsworth, and his eight staff members were all killed, along with the pilot, David White.

The plane was operated by Leavitt Group Wings.
