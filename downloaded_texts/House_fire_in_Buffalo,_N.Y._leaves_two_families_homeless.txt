A fire that started in the attic on Baynes Street between Bird and Forest Avenues in Buffalo, New York left 2 families, totaling 6 people, homeless including three children.

A resident living on the second floor of the two family house called 911 at around 8:00 p.m. on August 16, 2006 and reported the smell of smoke. When firefighters arrived they "saw flames shooting out of the third floor window," a firefighter told Wikinews.

Firefighters said that there was "severe damage from the fire to the third floor," but the second and first floor apartments suffered smoke and water damage.

Witnesses say that smoke from the blaze could be seen as far as a half mile away.

There were no injuries to any residents or firefighters and the cause of the blaze is still under investigation. Residents of the house would not comment.
