Between the years of 1996 and 2003, McQueen received Fashion Designer of the Year four times. He was also given a CBE by Queen Elizabeth II in 2003. The fashion designer had a new selection of clothing, entitled "McQ", that was expected to be shown on Thursday; the show has now been cancelled. Alexander's mother Joyce died earlier this month. In response to this, McQueen placed a message on his Twitter page which said "RIP mumxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx." Isabella Blow, who assisted in making McQueen famous, killed herself in 2007.

Yesterday, a statement was released from McQueen's company headquarters stating "On behalf of Lee McQueen's family, Alexander McQueen today announces the tragic news that Lee McQueen, the founder and designer of the Alexander McQueen brand, has been found dead at his home. At this stage it is inappropriate to comment on this tragic news beyond saying that we are devastated and are sharing a sense of shock and grief with Lee's family. Lee's family has asked for privacy in order to come to terms with this terrible news and we hope the media will respect this."
