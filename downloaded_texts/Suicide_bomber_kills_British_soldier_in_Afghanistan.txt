A British soldier has been killed and another is seriously injured after a suicide bomber struck a NATO convoy in Kabul, the capital city of Afghanistan. It is believed the attacker drove his vehicle into the convoy. Four Afghan civilians were also killed in the incident, four more were injured.

In a statement, the Ministry of Defence said: "Sadly, one UK soldier has been killed and another very seriously injured as a result of this attack. The injured soldier has been evacuated to a military medical facility for treatment. No further details of the incident will be released until next of kin have been informed."

The death comes two days after 14 British military servicemen were killed after their RAF Nimrod plane crash landed near Kandahar.

So far, 37 British troops have been killed in Afghanistan since military operations started in 2001.
