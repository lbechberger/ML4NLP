The French mime Marcel Marceau died at age 84 yesterday in Paris. Emmanuel Vacca, Marceau's former assistant, announced his death on a French-Info radio station. Media reports also indicated his death was announced by his family.

Marceau appeared on stage for over 50 years without uttering a word. But, the off-stage chatty Marceau once said, "Never get a mime talking. He won't stop." His last known international tour was in 2005.

Prime Minister Francois Fillon said, "The mime Marceau will forever be the character of Bip."

Marceau was a French Jew who survived the Holocaust. Marceau was born as Marcel Mangel in Strasbourg, France on March 22, 1923.

No details about the cause of death or the funeral arrangements were immediately clear.
