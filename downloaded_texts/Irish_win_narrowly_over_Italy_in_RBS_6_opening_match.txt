Ireland won the opening RBS 6 Nations match 26-16 last Saturday. The match, pitting Italy vs. Ireland at Lansdowne Road, was not the game many thought it would be. The Italian side Captained by Marco Bortolami showed that the Azzuri were a force to be reckoned with. "In the first 20 minutes we really hadn't much ball and didn't get into many attacking positions. They got their confidence out of that and they took the game to us. It was an ugly game of rugby by any standards," said Ireland coach Eddie O'Sullivan.

The question to be asked is whether or not Italy played well, or Ireland played poorly. "If you go to the Stade de France and play like that you're going to get obliterated," stated Brian O'Driscoll the Ireland Skipper. Italian Boss Pierre Berbizier said, "Against the Irish we succeeded in stopping the opposing attacks." Staying confident of their impressive show against the Irish, Italy's squad to face England next weekend remains unchanged.
