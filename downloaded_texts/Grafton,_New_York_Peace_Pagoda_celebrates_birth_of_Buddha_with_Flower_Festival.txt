The annual Flower Festival celebrating the Birth of Buddha on Sunday, May 26, 2002 occurred at the Grafton Peace Pagoda this Sunday in Grafton, New York.

A nun of the Nipponzan Myohoji Buddhist sect, Jun-san Yasuda, organized the Flower Festival. The two-hour ceremony, including chanting, peace speeches, and singing, was conducted by monks and peace walkers. Several hundred attendees joined in bathing the baby Buddha in sweet medicinal tea. 

Afterwards, complimentary food and drink was available as attendees mingled in the old temple.
