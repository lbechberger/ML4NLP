Stephen Harper, the Prime Minister of Canada, has announced an investment of C$13.5 million (US$10.8 million) to upgrade the Blue Water Bridge.

This bridge connects Port Huron, Michigan and Point Edward, Ontario across the St. Clair River, and is the second-busiest Canada – United States border crossing. 

"Blue Water Bridge is a crucial link in trade between Canada and the United States. This cross-border traffic is vital to our export industries – and more important than ever, given the current global economic downturn," said Harper. "This project will reduce border congestion, improve trade, and create local jobs."

The investment will widen the bridge approach to Ontario Highway 402 and provide new Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) inspection booths.
