A man wielding a machete entered a Penrose, Auckland gun shop, Small Arms International, this morning at about 10.00 a.m. The man was shot in the stomach by a pistol, he is now in a stable condition after being taken to hospital for surgery.

Allegedly the shooter was the store manager, who is the son of the owner of the gun shop. The owner, Ray Carvell, said that his son "feared for his life. [My] son was clearly terrified and acted in self defence."

New Zealand Police are speaking to four witnesses.

Simon Scott, Detective Senior Sargeant, said "police have yet to decide if there is any criminal liability."
