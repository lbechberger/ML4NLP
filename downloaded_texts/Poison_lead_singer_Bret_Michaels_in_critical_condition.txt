Singer Bret Michaels has remained in a critical condition after suffering a brain haemorrhage. The Poison singer was rushed to a Los Angeles hospital on Friday with complaints of a severe headache.
 
His publicist released a statement saying that "Bret is a fighter and we are hopeful that once all is complete, the slurred speech, blurred vision and dizziness etc will be eliminated and all functions will return to normal." He added that Michaels is conscious. 

Michaels reached fame in the 1980s along with the glam rock band Poison. The group released such songs as “Every Rose Has Its Thorn” and “Talk Dirty to Me”. They are still recording and releasing music after 25 years. Michaels also recently recorded a song with teen singer Miley Cyrus. 

The singer can currently be seen on US television on reality show The Celebrity Apprentice. The show which was recorded six months ago, is only half way through the current series. Michaels is one of the favourites to win. Fellow celebrities have sent messages to Michaels, British music manager Sharon Osborne said "I'm thinking of you and wishing you a speedy recovery", while former Professional wrestler Maria Kanellis asked fans to keep Michaels in their prayers. The show’s host Donald Trump also sent Michaels his well wishes.
