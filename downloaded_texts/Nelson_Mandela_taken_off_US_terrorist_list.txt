Nelson Mandela has officially been taken off the US list of terrorists by the United States government. This comes after a statement by Condoleezza Rice, the US Secretary of State, who said that it was a "rather embarrassing matter that I still have to waive in ... the great leader Nelson Mandela," back in April.

The ruling, which also applied to all members of the African National Congress means that Mandela can travel to the United States without being approved by the Secretary of State.

Nelson Mandela has recently been in the media due to his upcoming 90th birthday. As part of the celebrations, a concert was held in Hyde Park, attended by many influential politicians, including Bill Clinton, former US president.

Nelson Mandela was a campaigner against apartheid who served one term as president of South Africa.


Last week the government of North Korea was removed from the list of State Sponsors of Terrorism. This announcement was made as a reward to North Korea for turning over all documents related to its controversial nuclear program. Pyongyang turned over to China documents related to its plutonium core and waste activities.
