A new cat has moved into 10 Downing Street, the residence of now British Prime Minister Gordon Brown, following in the footsteps, or rather pawsteps, of previous Westminister cats "Humphery" and "Wilberforce".

"Sybil", named after "Sybil Fawlty", a character in the British sitcom Fawlty Towers, belongs to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Alistair Darling, who now lives in residence in a flat above 10 Downing Street (11 Downing Street) itself, having previously lived in Darling's residence in Scotland.

A spokesman for Prime Minister Gordon Brown said, "The prime minister and Sarah (wife of Brown) do not have a problem with it. I am sure the cat will appear at some point."

The cats at 10 Downing Street are often referred to as the, "10 Downing Street mousers" and are given the job of getting rid of mice. There has not been a cat in residence at the house since 1997, after Tony came to power. There were several rumours that Blair's wife, Cherie, was behind the move.
