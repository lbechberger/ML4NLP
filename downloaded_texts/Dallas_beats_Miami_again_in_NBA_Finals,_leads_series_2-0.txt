The Dallas Mavericks beat the Miami Heat 99-85 in the second game of the NBA Finals and lead the series 2-0. The second game was solidly in Dallas' favor the entire time.

Miami star Shaquille O'Neal scored his career low in points for a playoff game and sat out the final 15 minutes. O'Neal was handed a $10,000 fine, as well as a $25,000 fine for the team, for declining to speak to reporters after the game.

Miami head coach, Pat Riley, said "I've been in a lot of playoff games, and I've gotten beat by 40, 30, 25, won by 25 or 30. Doesn't make any difference. The whole thing is about the next game and trying to leave this one behind us. Maybe it will set a fire in us a little bit."

Dallas must win two more games to become the NBA champions.
