TeliaSonera Sweden has announced today that it is increasing the speed of data traffic through its GSM mobile network due to the introduction of EDGE technology. This will require an investment of approximately â‚¬110 million, over a four-year period. The new technology will enable transmission speeds of up to 210/105 kpbs.

The company also intends to increase the coverage of its GSM network from 70% to 90% of Sweden's land area. While Sweden has a high mobile penetration rate and a high rate of coverage in terms of population, land area coverage was previously only 70% due to the country's relatively low population density as well as its northern highland areas.

TeliaSonera is the largest communications company in Northern Europe, formed as a result of a merger between Sweden's Telia and Finland's Sonera. It is owned 45.3% by the Swedish state.
