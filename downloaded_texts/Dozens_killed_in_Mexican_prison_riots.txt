Dozens of people have been killed in Mexico after two separate prison riots broke out in the city of Mazatlan.

According to the Public Safety Secretary, in the first attack, which occurred Monday, twenty inmates of the jail were shot to death after members of a gang started shooting at a rival group. Jail security staff managed to regain control of the prison, and found two assault rifles inside.

Another inmate was hospitalised and later died; three policemen were also wounded, and one is in serious condition.

Eight hours afterwards, another clash erupted, this time when inmates were stabbed by fellow prisoners, according to Public Safety Department spokesman Angeles Moreno. He added that police are investigating the cause of the attacks.
