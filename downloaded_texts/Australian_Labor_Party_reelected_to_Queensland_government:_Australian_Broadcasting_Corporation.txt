Election analysts for the Australian Broadcasting Corporation have called the Queensland state election for the Australian Labor Party. The ABC lists the seats won as ALP 50; Liberal National Party 29; Others 4; and 5 in doubt.

A win for the ALP means that Anna Bligh becomes the first female to be elected premier in Australian history. She is the third female to be appointed premier.

The ABC predicted that the ALP will gain 53 of the 89 seats, the LNP 31 with 5 seats going to other candidates. 

The analysts are predicting that Queensland Greens MP Ronan Lee will lose his seat of Indooroopilly. 

Polls published in The Australian predicted a hung parliament. The ABC's predictions contradict these polls.

The Courier Mail also gives the election to the ALP. They give the ALP 49 seats; LNP 27; Others 4; and 9 undecided.

Opposition leader Lawrence Springborg conceded the election at 8:15pm local time (12:15pm UTC).
