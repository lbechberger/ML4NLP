Protests continue in Venezuela over the Sunday closing of Radio Caracas Television (RCTV), the country's oldest and most popular TV station.

Hugo Chavez's reasons for not renewing the TV station's broadcasting license include RCTV's support of a coup d'Ã©tat attempt in 2002. RCTV was not the only media station to support the coup but, they have been closed because many say that they are the most significant TV station of the opposition. Venevision which supported the coup at the time has recently had its license renewed for 5 more years, which many say is due for their change in their editorial stance.
