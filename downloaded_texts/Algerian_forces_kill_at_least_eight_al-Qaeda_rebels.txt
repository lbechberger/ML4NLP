Algerian media has reported that the Algerian army has killed ten al-Qaeda rebels in an eastern area of the country. However, the Associated Press have only reported the number as eight. The rebels were killed in what is considered a stronghold of al-Qaeda's North African wing.

According to reports, seven insurgents were killed in the Kabylie region, around 100 km from the capital city of Algiers, over the weekend. A further three rebels were reportedly killed on Thursday although circumstances are less known.

The Algerian security authorities said that troops launched an operation at dawn on Saturday after villagers reported insurgents in the area searching for food. They added that the killings started with a helicopter bombardment on the suspected area.

Al-Qaeda is well known in Algeria for kidnappings and bomb attacks. Over the past couple of years, violence has become a rarer occurrence.
