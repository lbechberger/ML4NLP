Bayern Munich's #1 goalkeeper Oliver Kahn striker Miroslav Klose have been ruled out of Thursday's UEFA Cup 1st Round 2nd Leg match against Portugal's Belenenses. Lukas Podolski has been ruled available after an injury scare. Kahn and Klose join Philipp Lahm, Willy Sagnol, José Ernesto Sosa and Valérien Ismael.

Oliver Kahn will require elbow surgery and will be out for five weeks.

Bastian Schweinsteiger, Marcell Jansen and Luca Toni didn't practice today for precautionary reasons.

Michael Rensing will replace Oliver Kahn in net while it's not known what formation Ottmar Hitzfeld will use on Thursday.
