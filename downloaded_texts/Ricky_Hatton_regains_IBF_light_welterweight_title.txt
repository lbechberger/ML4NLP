Ricky "The Hitman" Hatton regained the IBF light welterweight title belt he relinquished less than 12 months ago when he defeated Juan Urango in Las Vegas, Nevada tonight.

"The Hitman" won by unanimous decision, as the fight went to 12 rounds. Despite early match odds suggesting Hatton would dominate the fight, this was not the case. Each round was close, but most pundits and judges alike agreed that Urango only won 1 of the 12 rounds, with Hatton taking the other 11.

Despite the unfamiliar confines of Las Vegas, Hatton looked touched by the ringing of football fan-like chants, familiar in British boxing, that rang around the arena, as more than half of it was filled by traveling support from across the atlantic.

Many in the UK will hope Hatton has ended the "curse" that has seen names such as Frank Bruno, Naseem Hamed, Barry McGuigan and others fall short while headlining fights on "The Strip".

From here, it is widely believed "The Hitman" will move on to fight Jose Luis Castillo in June, again likely in Vegas.
