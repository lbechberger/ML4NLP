A teenager slashed a woman to death as he attempted to steal $6 off her—to buy beer. The 16-year-old boy, Alan Tanguay, now faces a first degree murder charge over the death of 58-year-old Patricia Kaliszeski from Palm Bay, Florida.

Tanguay told investigators he was approached by Kaliszeski with a knife as he was burgling the house. He took it from her and used it to attack her, before hitting her over the head with a lamp.

Tanguay is currently being held in a juvenile holding area but he could face an adult charge over the incident.

When police accessed his account on a social networking web site, they found statements describing how he enjoys gory violence, "like people getting their neck slit and tounge [sic] pulled out".

One witness told police that the teenager claimed to have killed before and also that "he has a rule—if he finds someone in the house during a burglary, he has to kill them".

It is not known whether Tanguay has already appeared in court or when he is scheduled to appear, according to police.
