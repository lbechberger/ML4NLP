On Sunday, Iran tested its second underwater missile, the Fajr-3. The underwater missile, Iran claims, can evade sonar.

"The missile carries a very powerful warhead that enables it to operate against groups of warships and big submarines. Even if an enemy's warship sonar can detect the missile, no warship can escape from this missile because of its high speed," said General Ali Fadavi of the Revolutionary Guards. He said the missile can travel at 328 feet a second.

If Iran's claims are correct, it would make this missile the fastest underwater missile in the world. The second fastest missile would be the Russian's VA-111 Shkval, which was developed in 1995.

Iran successfully tested its first missile on March 31, 2006, and claims that it can "evade radar and it can evade anti-missile missiles," said Hossein Salami, head of the Revolutionary Guards Air Force. "This technology is completely new, without copying any other missile systems that may exist in other countries" and also says it can carry several warheads.

It is also reported that more missiles will be tested during war games later in the week.
