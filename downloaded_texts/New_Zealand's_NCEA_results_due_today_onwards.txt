New Zealand's NCEA (National Certificate of Educational Achievement) results for each student will start arriving today onwards. The results will be posted online today and have been sent out sooner than in previous years.

Around 136,000 students took part in the 2006 external exams and NZQA (New Zealand Qualifications Authority) say 85% of them will receive their results in today's, Wednesday, mail. Student's living in rural areas will receive their results on Friday. Scholarship results will be sent out sometime mid February.

Bali Haque said that it was a huge logistical operation to get all the results out but said that it went smoothly.

Each student already knows their results for their internal results but are awaiting their grades (not achieved, achieved, merit or, excellence) of their external end-of-year exams.

NZQA said that the marking of over a million NCEA papers and scholarship papers went smoothly despite having a mistake in a level two mathematics paper. However NZQA says no students will be affected by the mistake.

After results have been received, students will then receive their answer booklets.
