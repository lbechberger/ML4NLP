Two people have died in Scotland as a result of the H1N1 virus, or swine flu. The Scottish Government revealed the information today.

Both of the victims were adults. One came from NHS Ayrshire and Arran and the other came from NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde. This announcement from the Scottish National Health Service (or NHS) means that the number of deaths from the virus in the country has now increased to 28.

Nicola Sturgeon, who is the current Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing in Scotland, made a statement about the situation: "I am sorry to have to announce two more deaths and my thoughts are with the patients' loved ones at this distressing time." Nicola said that most people who caught the virus would make a full recovery after experiencing mild symptoms of the flu and that both of the victims in this particular case had underlying health problems. Sturgeon, who is also the Deputy First Minister of Scotland said: "The vaccination is being rolled out but please wait until you are invited before visiting your GP for the vaccine."
