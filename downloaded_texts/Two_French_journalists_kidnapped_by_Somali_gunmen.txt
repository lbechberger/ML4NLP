Two foreign journalists have reportedly been kidnapped from their hotel by unidentified gunmen in Mogadishu, Somalia.

The abduction took place this morning, when men wearing Somalian police uniform arrived at the Sahafi Hotel, which is in an area of the city controlled by pro-government forces.

The hotel manager said "Several gunmen entered the Sahafi Hotel, pointed guns at the guards and went into the hotel rooms where they took away the two French nationals. The two males told me they were journalists."
