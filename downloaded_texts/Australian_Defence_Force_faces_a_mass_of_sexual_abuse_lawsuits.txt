The Australian Defence Force could face a class-action lawsuit in light of recent allegations of a male cadet broadcasting himself having sex with a female cadet to six other cadets at the Australian Defence Force Academy.

This move is in light of similar investigations taking place in other branches of the defence force including the navy where a man told the Vietnam Veterans Association he was beaten repeatedly on the HMAS Leeuwin during the 1970's. The beatings included being sexually abused with a mop handle according to the man. Advocates believe that the recent sex scandal could result in 'hundreds' of other victims coming forward.

Senator Nick Xenophon has called on Foreign Minister Stephen Smith to make inquires into the sexual nature of the ADFA a priority of the government. Mr. Xenophon is also considering a class action on behalf of all victims.

Both the VVA and Mr. Xenophon have called on other victims to come forward.
