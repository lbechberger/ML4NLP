Earlier today at 6pm EST, Mitt Romney, the Governor of Massachusetts announced he would not seek a second-term for the highest office in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

The announcement did not come as a surprise due to the fact Romney announced he would make an announcement on his political future last month. Romney has also been visiting key primary states for the 2008 presidential election and during the 2004 presidential election, Republicans told the press, "to keep an eye on Romney."

Romney was elected in 2003, replacing Jane Swift and his term ends in Janurary 2007. If he does decide to run for the presidency, he will have ample time when the terms ends. So far, Romney has denied that he is running for President and may possibly change his mind and run for re-election. He also said that he would endorse his Lieutenant Governor, Kerry Healey if she decides to run for governor.

Romney, born in Detroit, is the son of former Governor of Michigan George W. Romney. Becoming governor isn't Romney's first foray into politics; Romney ran against senior Massachusetts senator and Kennedy family member, Ted Kennedy. Romney won 41% percent of the vote against Kennedy in the closest election in Kennedy's entire tenure in the United States Senate. Romney was also CEO of the Salt Lake Organizing Committee which was in charge of planning the 2002 Winter Olympics from 1999 to 2002, he took charge after the 2002 Winter Olympic bid scandal. He also sat on the board of Massachusetts-based office supply giant, Staples, Inc.
