Mount Stromlo, Canberra â€” This Easter weekend, elite mountain bike riders competed in the Australian 24-hour solo championships at Canberra's Stromlo Forest Park. Jason English from Port MacQuarie rode 33 laps and won the men's race. Liz Smith from Wollongong rode 25 laps and won the women's race.

Races are won by riding the most laps. If two riders complete the same number of laps in 24-hours, the winner is the one who has ridden them in the shortest time. 

Riders wear lights on their helmets and bicycles during night laps. Due to the time of year, there is roughly twelve hours of daylight and twelve hours of darkness each day. 

The event is a curtain raiser for the WEMBO World Solo 24 hour Mountain Bike Championships, which will be held at Stromlo Forest Park on 12 and 13 October 2013. The race was for solo riders only.

The weekend before, the teams of riders took to the track at the Mont 24 hour race at Canberra's Kowen forest. With over 3,000 riders participating, it is now Australia's largest cycling race. 

The team version of the race was favoured by the weekend warriors, but also attracted more than a few elite athletes. Laps were ridden in relay fashion: each rider handed over the baton (which looked like a credit card) to another member of the team after riding one or more laps.

The track was in excellent condition, running through the trees. Without steep climbs or overly difficult technical sections, it permitted fast lap times. 

No injuries were reported.
