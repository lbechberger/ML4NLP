The International Olympic Committee has announced today that baseball and softball are to be cut from Olympic competition from 2012. Rugby, karate, rollersports, golf, and squash have been rumored to be included. The IOC meets later today to discuss the new Olympic Program.

The vote, held in Singapore, surprised some supporters of the sports, who believed that there were enough votes to retain them.
