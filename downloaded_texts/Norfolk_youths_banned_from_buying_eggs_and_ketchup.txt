Youths in the Norfolk town of Caister-on-Sea, near Great Yarmouth, England, have been banned from purchasing "squirty bottles" of ketchup, and eggs after a number of complaints from residents in the area. The move, which is backed by the Norfolk Police, is aimed at reducing the number of anti-social incidents occurring in the area. Sergeant Andy Brown, of the Norfolk Police, has said that no further complaints have been received since the ban came into force. 

While squirting ketchup itself is not a criminal offence, the damage that it can cause, such as removing paint from cars or houses, is often enough to bring charges of criminal damage. Sgt Brown said that there were "about a dozen complaints from residents, some of them elderly, about people squirting ketchup over doors, windows and vehicles." Martin Bailie, a spokesperson for Lidl supermarkets, has defended his staff's actions, saying "the stores' staff were [already] challenging youngsters who were trying to bulk buy these things. It wasn't that we haven't been selling eggs and ketchup to youths, but have been careful about who we have sold them to, and we are glad it has been making a difference."
