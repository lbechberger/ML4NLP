State officials say Vermont's first case of West Nile virus has been confirmed in Brattleboro, Vermont. 

State officials said that nine birds tested positive for West Nile virus in 2006, and there have been no human cases of the West Nile virus since 2003. "This is the seventh year of our surveillance program and a good time to remind people that West Nile Virus reaches its peak late in the summer, when the virus has had time to develop in the mosquito population," said state Health Department Epidemiologist Patsy Tassler. "Before a long holiday weekend, it's a good reminder for Vermonters to take precautions and avoid exposure to mosquitoes especially at dusk and dawn when they are most active."
