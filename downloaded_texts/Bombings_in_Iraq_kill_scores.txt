Scores of people have died in Iraq Tuesday due to multiple bombings in various major Iraqi cities. United Press International put the death toll at 69, although the figure given by the BBC is lower. Their reports state that the toll was over 50.

One of the explosions occurred outside of a restaurant in Baquba. It resulted in over 40 fatalities and 70 injuries.

There was another incident in a restaurant, this time in the city of Ramadi. It resulted in a minimum of thirteen deaths and thirteen injuries.

Three also died from a car bomb in Baghdad.

A person who witnessed one of the bombings commented on the situation. "I saw cars on fire, burned bodies and damaged shops with shattered glass everywhere," he said.
