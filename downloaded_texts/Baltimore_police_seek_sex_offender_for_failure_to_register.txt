Police in Baltimore County, Maryland asked for the public's help to find 23-year-old Matthew P. Keenan. Police said an arrest warrant had been issued for Keenan on the charge of failing to update his information with Maryland's State Sex Offender Registry.

Police described Keenan as a white male, 5'6" (1.7 m) tall, 150 pounds (68 kg) with brown hair and brown eyes. They believed Keenan was last seen in the Armistead Gardens neighborhood of Baltimore, Maryland.

Mandatory registration for offenders convicted of certain sexual or violent crimes began in Maryland after 1994. Addresses of offenders have been made public.

According to the registry, Keenan is a child sex offender. Detectives added that Keenan was convicted of raping a child in 2002. This conviction led to the requirement that Keenan keep his current address on file with the registry. Keenan's last verified address listed with the registry was in the 3700-block of North Point Road in Dundalk, Maryland.

Police asked those with information on Keenan to call them at 410-307-2020 or Metro Crime Stoppers at 1-866-756-2587.
