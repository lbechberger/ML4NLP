Nicki Jex, 27, from the Braunstone sub-urb of Leicester, UK has been jailed for five years as he robbed Ladbrokes, a bookmaker, in Narborough Road, Leicester for more than £613.

Jex threatened the shop's manager with a Rabbit vibrator which he hid in a carrier bag pretending that it was a gun.

A customer of the Ladbrokes shop, Wayne Vakani, followed Jex as he left and after being warned off by Jex he continued to follow but maintained a distance. Thanks to Mr Vakani, Jex's hat was recovered which contained DNA. Vakani was awarded £500 by the judge for his "very considerable courage". 

The whole event was caught on CCTV.
