With wins in the state primaries of Vermont, Ohio, Texas, and Rhode Island, Senator John McCain has gathered enough delegates to clinch the Republican Party's nomination for President of the United States.

President George W. Bush has invited McCain to the White House on Wednesday to show his support for the candidate.

Meanwhile, McCain's rival Mike Huckabee officially dropped out of the race after giving a concession speech at his campaign headquarters. "We kept the faith, that for me has been the most important goal of all," said Huckabee, referring to his conservative Christian principles that gained him much support among evangelicals. "I'd rather lose the election than lose the principles that got me into politics in the first place."
