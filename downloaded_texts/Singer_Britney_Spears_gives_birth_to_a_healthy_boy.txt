On September 14, pop singer Britney Spears reportedly gave birth to a baby boy through Cesarean section. Spears and husband Kevin Federline issued a statement on their website confirming the birth later in the week, saying the following: "We are ecstatic to announce the birth of our son! Everyone is happy, healthy and doing wonderful. Thank you for all your love and well wishes!!".

Spears reportedly gave birth through a Cesarean section due to the fact she did not want to experience the regular pain encountered during child birth. She has been met with some criticism by her fans in wake of this report.

The birth of the boy, whose birth name is disputed among different sources, is considered very important in the entertainment world. Analysts say his first photo could be sold by his parents for upwards of US$1,000,000.
