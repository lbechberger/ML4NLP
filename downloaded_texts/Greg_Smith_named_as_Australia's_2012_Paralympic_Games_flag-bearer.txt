Earlier today, at a ceremony in Wales' Cardiff Castle, the Australian Paralympic Committee announced the selection of wheelchair rugby player Greg Smith as Australian flag-bearer during the opening of the 2012 Summer Paralympics. Over 260 members of Australia's 305-strong Paralympic team attended the announcement of Smith as flag-bearer.

Multiple gold, silver and bronze medallist, Smith has represented Australia in multiple Paralympic Games in two different sports: 1992, 1996 and 2000 saw him compete in athletics; 2004 and 2008 were the games where he switched to wheelchair rugby. The Australian Paralympic Committee quoted Smith saying of this honor, "I remember in Barcelona in 1992 at my first Games when the flag bearer was announced. I just thought "Wow, that's something very special". I could have never imagined that being me one day. I just remember that feeling of how proud youâ€™d be if you were given such an honour."

Smith joins a list of previous Australian flag bearers including Brendan Burkett in 2000, Louise Sauvage in 2004 and Russell Short in 2008. 

Australians can watch the Opening Ceremonies live on the ABC on August 30 at 5:20am Sydney time.
