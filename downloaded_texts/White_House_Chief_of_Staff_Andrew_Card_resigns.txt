President Bush has announced that Andrew Card, White House Chief of Staff, has resigned, and will be replaced by current budget director Joshua Bolten. 

In recent weeks Republican insiders have been urging the President to reshape his advisors to deal with his declining popularity ratings. Bolten has had wide experience both on Wall Street and in Washington. In Washington he has been the Deputy Chief of Staff and also the director of the Office of Management and Budget. 

Card will remain as chief of staff until April 14. It is unknown at this time what he will do after leaving the post. He had previously served as State Representative in Holbrook, Mass., his hometown, so it has been speculated that he may return to Mass. to run for office.
