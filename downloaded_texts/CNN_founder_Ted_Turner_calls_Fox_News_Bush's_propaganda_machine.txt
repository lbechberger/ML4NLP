Ted Turner, the founder of CNN, last Tuesday accused Fox News of being a propaganda mouthpiece for the Bush administration. He likened the network's current popularity to Adolf Hitler's rise to power in pre-war Germany, and criticised the "dumbing down" of news which left the public uninformed of crucial issues.

Turner said, "Adolf Hitler was more popular in Germany in the early 1930s than people that were running against him."

Fox News in turn accused CNN of simple sour grapes.

In a statement, the channel claimed that Ted was "understandably bitter having lost his ratings, his network and now his mind - we wish him well."

Turner resigned from his post as Vice President of AOL Time Warner in January 2003. He remains one of America's largest private landowners, possessing approximately two million acres of land.

Fox News remains the highest rating 24-hour news channel on US cable - but has been highly criticised for its perceived right-wing bias.

Recent House Committee on Government Reform figures by the US Democrats show that the US Administration spent over $US88 million on public relations contracts in 2004, of which 41 per cent were awarded on a non-competitive basis.
