Two policewomen were shot in Bradford city centre today â€” one fatally. The surviving officer has been hospitalized in Bradford Royal Infirmary. The officer who died is believed to have only joined the police force within the past two years. The murdered officer has been named as 38 year old Sharon Beshenivsky. The second officer has been named as 37 year old Teresa Milburn.

The officers are believed to have been responding to an alarm call from a personal attack alarm at "Universal Express Travel Agents" 116 - 120 Morley Street at around 3:25 GMT. 

The murder took place on Morley Street, which is in the University and College part of City, at the crossroads with Great Horton Lane are the main student entertainments and night clubs. The Alhambra theatre is at the bottom half of the street. The area is heavily covered by CCTV, which may help the investigation.

Home secretary Charles Clarke said, "While incidents of this sort are mercifully rare, they serve to remind us of the risks and dangers police officers face every day in their work to uphold the law and protect the public."

Six people are currently under arrest in relation to the murder. Most of the surrounding area in Bradford has been closed off.
