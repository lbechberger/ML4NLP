A large quantity of Niobium was discovered at Panda Hill in Mbeya Region in Tanzania. Two companies did the prospecting assessment; one of which is Rex Well, a subsidiary of Euronet Africa of UK. Mining could start any time. 

Last year's survey by the firm indicated that the area has about 90 million tonnes of Niobium. The company would use open cast method, as most of the mineral is found near the surface.
