Eurostar train services which link the United Kingdom with Europe via the Channel Tunnel have moved to a new London terminal. The first services from St Pancras International launched today following the completion of the Channel Tunnel Rail Link which promises to reduce journey times to Europe by 20 minutes.

The Channel Tunnel Rail Link, to be branded as High Speed 1, has been built in two phases; the first section was completed in 2003 and the second section was brought into use today. 

Eurostar chief executive Richard Brown said: "Today marks a new dawn for short-haul travel in Europe. Our move to St Pancras makes Eurostar even more accessible to travellers across Britain. We will carry passengers with greater speed, ease and reliability than ever before, and our travellers will have the extra reassurance of knowing that they are making far less environmental impact compared with flying." 

Waterloo railway station, the previous international London terminal, will be returned to domestic use following the move to St Pancras.
