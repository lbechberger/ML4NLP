Wikinews held an exclusive interview with Kevin Baugh, president of the Republic of Molossia. Molossia is a micronation or entity that resembles an independent nation but which is unrecognized by world governments or major international organisations.

Molossia is situated on several acres of land in western Nevada, within driving distance of Reno. Unlike most of today's micronations, Molossia allows visitors and has its own economy. It also has its own time zone and holidays as well as a few tourist attractions.

President Baugh said of his country, "Molossia is unique among
micronations in that we possess actual land, real terra firma upon which we
stake our national claim. Most micronations only exist on the internet and
don't have land. We are quite proud of our little country, and display all
the trappings of a full-fledged nation, including our flag, boundary
markers, signs, a couple of small tourist attractions and so forth, as well
as our own money, stamps, national anthem, navy and even a space program.....Our goal is to exercise complete sovereignty over our country without annoying the United States." 

The United States recognizes the territory claimed by Molossia as part of the United States and exercises the same dominion over it as it does over any other part of the country.
