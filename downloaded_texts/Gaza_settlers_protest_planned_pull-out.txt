Israel's Independence Day was marked by protests around Gaza as nationalist Israelis rallied against the planned dismantling of 21 settlements in the region. The settlements house 8,500 Jews, surrounded by 1.3 million Palestinians. 

The protests where peaceful as many marched or even held picnics in the settlements. Police estimated a turnout of about 35,000 but organizers estimated 80,000. 

This comes after similar, larger protests against Ariel Sharon's plan to end conflict with the Palestinians over the area.
