Speaking on the US House floor Thursday, Cynthia Mckinney stated, "There should not have been any physical contact in this incident." Her remarks were in relation to an incident last week where she struck a US Capitol police officer as he attempted to stop her from walking through a metal detector. During her speech she also stated that she would vote for a resolution supporting the efforts of the Capitol police.

Her speech comes on the same day when a Disctrict of Columbia grand jury began hearing testimony regarding the McKinney case. It is possible that McKinney may be charged in relation to the case, possibly as early as next week.
