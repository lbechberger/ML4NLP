Last Saturday, Maria Lourdes Sereno was appointed as Chief Justice Supreme Court in the Philippines, becoming the first woman to hold the post. She replaced Renato Corona, who was impeached last May. 

Philippine President Benigno Aquino III formally appointed the 52-year-old Sereno Saturday morning. With the post having a retirement age of 70, it is expected to see her serve one of the longest terms for the office.

Like the President, Sereno is also a graduate of Ateneo de Manila University. She continued her studies in University of the Philippines, Diliman and University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.

Born on July 2, 1960 in Manila, Sereno previously served as a legal consultant for the United Nations, the World Bank, the US Agency for International Development, and the Asian Institute of Management Policy Center. She had taught at the University of the Philippines College of Law for nineteen years
