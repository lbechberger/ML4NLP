Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, and Kuwait all recalled their ambassadors to Syria Monday over concerns about the crackdown on protestors by the Syrian government.

King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia announced the decision to recall the country's Syrian ambassador in a statement read on state television, saying that "[t]he Kingdom of Saudi Arabia [demands] the stoppage of the killing machine and bloodshed, and the use of reason before it is too late".

Foreign Minister Sheikh Khaled bin Ahmad al-Khalifa of Bahrain said that Syria should "resort to reason" and Kuwaiti Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammad al-Sabah called for an end to military action, saying that "no-one can accept the bloodshed." al-Sabah also said that officials from several countries in the region plan to meet in the near future to discuss Syria.

In addition to the recall of the ambassadors, diplomatic pressure increased on Syria from other fronts, with Prime Minister Nasser Judeh of Jordan making a televised request for talks between the protestors and government, and the Arab League issuing its first statement about the situation in Syria on Sunday, saying it is "alarmed" by events.
