According to the Washington Post, nearly sixty percent of the federal government's workforce will be eligible for retirement over the next ten years; with ninety percent of senior executive service officials expected to do so. Besides depleting Social Security funds, baby boomers will once again leave a big impression on the American workforce and economy. Calling it a "federal retirement tsunami," the United States Office of Personnel Management (the bureau responsible for government human resources) is preparing for this event in a few manners. In a news release today by the bureau, Director Linda Springer announced that the office would be releasing a major media campaign in efforts to recruit future employees.

With only twenty four percent of United States citizens with a bachelor degree or higher, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, it's no wonder it has been difficult to attract qualified or interested employees for federal government positions; particularly young people. "We've been hearing for so long about how incompetent and shady the government is, but a lot don't understand the benefits," said Howard University sophomore Victoria Hooks. 

"The challenge is clear, and we are hard at work... with a 21st Century approach to the workplace, the federal government will ride the retirement wave and set the standard for a modern workplace... It will be a modern workplace, one that requires innovative training and encourage more flexibility by managers. The federal workforce will be one that the American people can count on," said Springer in support of the initiatives for recruitment. Other efforts for recruitment will also include additional employment benefits such as special salaries and relocation bonuses, especially for women.

The recruitment advertisements will reveal themselves in a series of four commercials around the country beginning in mid May 2006.
