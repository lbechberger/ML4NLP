Two men have been found guilty of murdering shopkeeper Gurmail Singh in a robbery at his shop in West Yorkshire, England. During the robbery at Cowcliffe Convenience Store in Huddersfield in February, Singh was hit over the head with bottles of wine and died the next day.

Muawaz Khalid, aged twenty, and Nabeel Shafi, aged eighteen, both from Huddersfield were convicted of murder after a six-week trial at Bradford Crown Court. Three other men were cleared of murder but two were convicted of robbery; the third had previously admitted to assisting an offender. They will be sentenced on November 16.

The court was told how smokers at a public house opposite the shop became aware of the robbery when two of the gang were seen fleeing the scene. A man attempted to trap two remaining members of the gang inside the shop but they escaped through a back door. Other members of the public tried to stop them but they were able to get away.

Detective Superintendent David Pervin of West Yorkshire Police, speaking after the convictions said, "[l]ocal people showed great courage in attempting to tackle and capture those responsible at the time of the attack and, after the tragic events of that night, the wider community united and showed massive support in helping us to put these people before the courts. I cannot thank them enough for that."
