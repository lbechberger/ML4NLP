A sheep has been sold for £231,000 (US$377,223) at an auction in Lanarkshire, Scotland. 
Farmer Jimmy Douglas bought the sheep for 220,000 guineas — the equivalent of roughly £231,000. The name of the sheep is 'Deveronvale Perfection' and it was bred in Banffshire by Graham Morrison, who eventually sold it. The sheep has a Texel ribbon attached to it and is a tup. In farming terms, a tup is an uncastrated male.

Graham Morrison stated that "He's [the sheep] the best lamb I've ever bred and the price surpassed my wildest dreams." Morrison mentioned that the sheep lives up to its name and that it was "perfection" when he was breeding it.

This is reported to be a new world record for the most amount of money paid for a sheep. It beats the previous record of the equivalent of £205,000 ($334,765) set in Australia in 1989. Eventually, its semen could be sold as well.
