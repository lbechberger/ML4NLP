After two weeks of illness, Juan Bustos, the president of the Chamber of Deputies of Chile, died at 10:46 local time (14:46 UTC) yesterday. The death took place at a ClÃ­nica Alemana in Santiago. Bustos died as a result of a liver cancer. He was 72 years old.

At the time of his death, Bustos was with his wife and five of his seven children, who were deeply upset by the death. The other two children are expected to arrive from Europe soon to attend the funeral.

Juan Bustos will be given a state fueral due to the position he occupied. In addition, the flags at many government buildings are being flown at half mast to mark the death.

The body has been moved to the former National Congress building so that the body can be guarded until the state funeral, which takes place at 11:00 local time tomorrow. After the state funeral, a private funeral for the family will take place.
