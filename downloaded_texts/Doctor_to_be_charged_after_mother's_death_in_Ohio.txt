A doctor who worked at Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania will be charged with aggravated murder after her mother was found dead in the trunk of her car Wednesday, authorities in Ohio say. Dr. Malar Balasubramanian, 29, was found in Blue Ash, Ohio, a suburb approximately 15 miles north of Cincinnati lying on the ground beside the road in a T-shirt and underwear in an apparently heavily medicated state. She directed officers to her black Oldsmobile Intrigue which was 500 feet away. There, they found the body of Saroja Balasubramanian, 53, covered with blood-stained blankets. Police said that the body appeared to have been there for about a day.

Dr. Malar Balasubramanian, formerly of the Squirrel Hill neighborhood of Pittsburgh, worked at Children's Hospital from June 2001 to June 2004, according to Melanie Finnigan, a hospital spokeswoman. She had recently returned from work in India.
