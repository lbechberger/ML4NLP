Despite allegations that the Mayor of London's office exerted pressure on the organisers of WorldPride in London to change the start time of the event to reduce the number of people attending, thousands of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer people and their supporters marched from Portman Square to Whitehall today. The event celebrated forty years since the first gay pride march in London in 1972.

Veterans of the 1972 march led the parade, and were followed by groups representing LGBT charity and campaigning groups including Stonewall and Terrence Higgins Trust, trade unions, student groups and corporations including Tesco, Google, Microsoft, IBM, Ernst and Young, Smirnoff, and KPMG.
