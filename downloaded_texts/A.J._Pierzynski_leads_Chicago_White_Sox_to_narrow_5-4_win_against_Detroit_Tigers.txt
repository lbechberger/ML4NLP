The Chicago White Sox scored a narrow 5–4 victory Monday against the Detroit Tigers after White Sox player A.J. Pierzynski scored a go-ahead run in extra innings. The go-ahead run gave the White Sox two extra runs.

"We're just finding ways to win games. We're battling. We're not giving at-bats away," Pierzynski, catacher for the White Sox, said after the game.

Though the White Sox led 3–2 in the fourth inning, Mark Kotsay got out at home plate when attempting to get the White Sox a fourth run. Later, Tiger Don Kelly scored a home run, pushing the Tigers up to a lead of 4–2. The homer had both Kelly and Miguel Cabrera scoring a run each. The White Sox also hit a run in the eighth inning.

Also notable was that rookie relief pitcher Chris Sale won his first game after pitching in the tenth inning. Sale, who is on the Sox, earned praise from Chicago manager Ozzie Guillen, who said "very, very pleasant surprise. Very, very nice."
