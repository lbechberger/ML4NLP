The Argentina national rugby union team has qualified for the 2007 Rugby World Cup to take place in France next year, during October and November. Argentina join Pool D with hosts France as well as Ireland and two nations that will come through as Europe 3 and Africa.

The Pumas, as Argentina are known, defeated Uruguay 26 points to nil at home at the San Isidro Athletic Club in Buenos Aires to take the first Americas spot. Miguel Avramovic scored two tries, with Federico Todeschini converting both, as well as kicking two penalty goals for Argentina. Following the Uruguay win, Argentina finished at the top of Round 3a of Americas qualifying. In their first match of Round 3a, Argentina defeated Chile 60 points to 12 in Santiago. Chile are currently in second place behind Argentina, however, there is still one fixture remaining, between Chile and Uruguay, so both nations have the chance to continue to the next round.

In the other group - Round 3b, the USA are leading the table, though they and Canada have both won one game - having defeated Barbados, who are now out of the running for a place. The USA and Canada are meeting in St. John's in Canada, on August 12th, 2006, which will determine who goes through to the World Cup as Americas 2, and who enters the Round 4 play-off against Chile to fight it out for Americas 3.
