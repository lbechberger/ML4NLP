Middle Eastern carrier Gulf Air has announced it is to provide direct flights from Dublin, Ireland to its hub in Manama, Bahrain from December three times a week. This is the first ever scheduled long haul route from Ireland not to North America.

Gulf Air, which is owned jointly by the Kingdom of Bahrain, the Sultanate of Oman and the Emirate of Abu Dhabi, will commence service using a Airbus A330 on the 2nd December 2005.

Gulf Air is hoping travellers will use the service as a gateway to Asia, Africa and Oceania. Previously most travellers went via Paris and London to reach destinations not served by a direct link.
