Mary Harney, Ireland's first female Tanaiste (deputy prime minister), resigned as leader of the Progressive Democrats on September 7, 2006.

The resignation was unexpected. It was believe she would lead the party for another year.Mary Harney said, "It is my wish to allow a successor the opportunity to lead our party into the general election next year.In my judgement, this is now the right time, as we prepare for a new DÃ¡il session and after a period of reflection over summer."

Members of her Parliamentary Party were very taken aback by her decision according to Senator John Dardis.

Nominations for the leadership will close at midday on September 18, 2006. If there are more than one nomination, an election contest will begin. All members of the Parliamentary Party can stand for the leadership. The leader is elected by an electoral college, which is compose of the Parliamentary Party, the party's Councillors and ordinary members.
