Guidant Corporation recently announced another safety warning on several models of its implantable defibrillators, cautioning users for the second time in a week about the devices. No patients are known to have been injured by the devices at this time. This brings the total number of defibrillator models recalled to twelve.

According to the Associated Press article, the five defibrillator models recalled "have a magnetic switch that can become stuck in a closed position, preventing the device from treating irregular heart rhythms. The faulty switch also can limit a defibrillator's battery life." 

After the announcement Friday, Guidant's stock dropped 6.9 percent, or $4.70, to $63.90.
