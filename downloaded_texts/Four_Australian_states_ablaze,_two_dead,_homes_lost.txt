Bushfires are burning across Victoria, South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania assisted by very hot conditions.

Victoria is the hardest hit with a single blaze burning out over 100,000 hectares (247,000 acres) and destroying 20 homes.

There are around a dozen fires burning in Victoria, with others in South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania.

Police are investigating whether or not two people found dead in their car near Moyston in South-West Victoria died as a result of the fire or died when their vehicle struck a tree.

Firefighters in the south of New South Wales have been placed on high alert as the hot weather moves North.

Firefighters across the affected states are hoping to take advantage of a cool change expected today. 

Earlier this month bushfires damaged property in New South Wales and Victoria.
