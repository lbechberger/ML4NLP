Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper made a visit to Hamilton yesterday to watch the 2007 annual Tim Hortons Brier at the Copps Coliseum.

Harper, who is currently writing a book about the history of Hockey, admitted he's a curling fan. He started to be a fan of curling in Winnipeg Manitoba 10 years ago and said his father used to play it.

"I've never curled but my father did when I was very young," he said. "I've followed the Brier for years. About the last decade or so I've made an effort to get to the Brier when I could. It is such a great Canadian tradition."

He cheered on for Alberta's Kevin Martin. Martin won 9â€“8 over players from Nova Scotia. Harper met with Kevin Martin after the event. Martin handed the PM his jersey from Monday's game.

"I've obviously got a soft spot for Kevin Martin and Alberta because he's had such a great career," said Harper. "But what's so great about the Brier is whoever wins is not like your normal pro athlete. They're usually great community people and Canadians. It's always easy to identify with whoever goes forward."

Robin MacPherson of Hamilton sat in front of him. She wore a large crown and was draped in gold.

She got to meet the PM and was quoted saying: "Not a lot of people get to meet a prime minister."
