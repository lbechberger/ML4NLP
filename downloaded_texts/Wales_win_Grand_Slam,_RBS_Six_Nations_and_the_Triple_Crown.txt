Wales have beaten Ireland in their eagerly anticipated encounter with the Celts in Cardiff today. It is the Welsh rugby team's first Grand Slam since 1978. The RBS Six Nations clash ended with the homeside 32 points, easily beating the Irish who managed 20 points.

It was clear from an early stage that Wales was on course for a win, with the score being 16-3 mid-way through the first half. The Irish effort improved in the second half with two trys closing the gap - but it was never going to be enough to beat a superb Welsh side.

The result means Wales have remained unbeaten throughout the tournament.
