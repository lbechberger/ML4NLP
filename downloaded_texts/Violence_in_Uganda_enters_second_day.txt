Ongoing violence between national security forces and supporters of the king of an ethnic group have killed at least ten people in Kampala, Uganda. 

The clashes have now been going on for two days. The conflict began when Muwenda Mutebi, the monarch 
of the ethnic group Buganda was prevented from travelling to the region of Kayunga by the government. Kayunga had said it seceded from his kingdom.

Ugandan president Yoweri Museveni said he wouldn't permit Mutebi into the Kayunga province. "I told him [Mutebi] that the meeting in Kayunga will not take place until some conditions that will be communicated to him by the minister of internal affairs are met," the president said.

Mutebi had not been allowed to make his visit because of a "security risk", police said.

Kampala has partially shut down as a result of the violence, with most businesses in the city's centre having been closed and most workers remaining at home.

Buganda is one of four ancient Ugandan kingdoms, whose tribal members constitute the largest ethnic 
group in the country. Traditional kingdoms were prohibited by former president Milton Obote in 1966, but reallowed in 1993 by the current president.
