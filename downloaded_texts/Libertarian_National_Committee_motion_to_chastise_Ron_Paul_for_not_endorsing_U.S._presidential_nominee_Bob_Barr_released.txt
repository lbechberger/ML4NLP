The Libertarian National Committee (LNC) continues to be in a fierce deadlock today over how to address the growing controversies surrounding their party's U.S. presidential nominee, former congressman Bob Barr.

Many libertarians have spoken out against Barr since his last minute refusal to attend former Republican presidential hopeful Congressman Ron Paul's third party unity conference at the National Press Club in Washington, DC last Wednesday.

One faction of the 17-member LNC, led by at-large representative Dr. Mary Ruwart — who lost the Libertarian Party's presidential nomination to Barr at the National Convention in May by only a few votes — is supporting a resolution to apologize to Paul.

This is being countered by another faction led by Treasurer Aaron Starr, who favors a resolution to chastise Paul for not endorsing Bob Barr and “splitting the Freedom Movement.” The motion supported by Starr was made available online Tuesday night. It can be read in its entirety below.
