A strong earthquake with magnitude 6.2 hit southwestern Iceland at 15:46 UTC. The epicenter was located 45 kilometers (30 miles) from the nation's capital, Reykjavik.

At least 30 people are reported to have been injured, but so far there are no reports of deaths. Some buildings along the main road leading to the town of Selfoss suffered minor damage, leading to the closure of the road. Almost 6,400 people live in the town.

"People are mostly shocked and scared but no one is seriously injured so far," said Soffia Sigurdardottir, a rescue worker assisting those in need of help. 

"Everything was shaking. The glass in the windows shook and everybody was just really scared," said Audbjorg Olafsdottir, an economist in Reykjavik.

Over 300,000 people live in Iceland. In June of 2000, a magnitude 6.6 quake struck the nation, which had been the country's first major earthquake in 88 years.
