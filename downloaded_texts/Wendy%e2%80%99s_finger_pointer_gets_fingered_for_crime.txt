San Jose police arrested the woman who made the claim she found a human finger in a bowl of Wendy's chili. Police made the arrest of Anna Ayala on Thursday night at or near her Las Vegas home.

A sign on the front door of the Ayala residence urged reporters and curious onlookers not to disturb the occupants. The sign reads, "Trust Me Do Not Knock On Door Emotionally Disturbard Thanx".

Anna Ayala was arrested on a fugitive warrant so no bail was set. Early this morning, Ayala was still behind bars at the Clark County Detention Center.

Police spokesman Enrique Garcia said further details on the 39-year-old Ayala will be released at a news conference scheduled for 1pm Friday.

According to the Los Angeles Times, the arrest came hours after Wendy’s concluded its own internal investigation that found no link to the finger in its food distribution chain.

Wendy’s offered a $100,000 reward for information leading to the source of the finger.
