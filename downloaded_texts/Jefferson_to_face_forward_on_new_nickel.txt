For the first time, the United States Mint will feature a president facing forward on a coin. President Thomas Jefferson will face forward on the 2006-dated five cent coin. This image is based on an 1800 painting of the president by Rembrandt Peale. This design is referred to by the mint as the "Jefferson 1800".

"The changing images in the Westward Journey Nickel Seriesâ„¢ lead us back to Thomas Jefferson, who envisioned the Louisiana Purchase and Lewis and Clark expedition as a way to move the Nation forward. The image of a forward-looking Jefferson is a fitting tribute to that vision," said United States Mint Acting Director David A. Lebryk.

United States Mint Artistic Infusion Program artist Jamie Franki, of Concord, NC, designed the obverse. It will be sculpted by Donna Weaver, and will feature the word "Liberty" in Jefferson's handwriting. The reverse will feature Monticello, designed by Felix Schlag, and restored from original work by John Mercanti.
