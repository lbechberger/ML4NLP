The Minnesota Twins, after suffering a cold loss at an even colder U.S. Cellular Field to the Chicago White Sox on Saturday, needed to heat up their offense for the final game of the series, and with help from Cy Young winner Johan Santana and AL MVP Justin Morneau, they did just that.

Starting pitcher Santana started slow, giving up an unusual three walks in the first couple innings, but turned things around after that, giving up just one hit in seven innings pitched, and throwing nine strikeouts. White Sox starter John Danks struck out six, but gave up 4 of the Twins' six hits, plus a three-run homer off the bat of Justin Morneau in the fourth.

The White Sox would respond by hitting a home run of their own, a solo shot off the bat of Juan Uribe in the eighth inning, but the Twins would hold them to just that one run, as closer Joe Nathan picked up the save.

Friday's postponed game will likely be rescheduled for the weekend of July 6, the next time the Twins play the White Sox in Chicago.

The White Sox, now 2-3, are hitting the road to Oakland for a three-game series against the Athletics starting tomorrow. The White Sox are 4-23 in the past six years at the McAfee Coliseum, and hope their starting pitcher Jose Contreras will bounce back after a rough opening day loss.

The Twins, now 4-1, will head back to Minneapolis to face the Yankees, with Sidney Ponson making his debut for the Twins.
