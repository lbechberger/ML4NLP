Four of six national television broadcast networks recently wooed potential advertisers for the 2005-2006 season with programming offerings in the new development phase. These included NBC, Fox, ABC and The WB. Two other networks, CBS and UPN, plan to preview their offerings March 24.

After four years of focusing on high-profile reality television, network executives are turning to the past for inspiration on scripted series. Some networks said they are "more consciously aggressive about developing shows" that recall such classics as Taxi and Barney Miller, Craig Erwich, a programming executive for Fox, told USA Today. In the same report, Kevin Reilly, NBC entertainment chief said, "I don't think the answer has to be that it's groundbreaking or something you've never seen before." 

But at least one ad buyer had reservations about the rear-view mirror technique. "Every network seems to be looking back rather than forward for programming ideas. The reminiscence factor may be good if you are looking for an older audience, but it may not be a way to bring in the younger audiences," Laura Caraccioli-Davis, senior vice president and director of Starcom Entertainment told Mediaweek magazine.
