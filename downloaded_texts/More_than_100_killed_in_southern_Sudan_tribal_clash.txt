The army of southern Sudan says more than 100 people were killed when a local tribe attacked a rival group in the southern state of Jonglei.

Gunmen from the Lou Nuer tribe attacked a village of the Dinka Hol tribe on Sunday, driving away security forces who were guarding the remote settlement of Duk Padiet. Southern Sudan army spokesman Kuol Diem Kuol said Monday that the dead include 23 attackers, 28 security forces, and more than 50 villagers, with 46 more injured.

"From the attackers 23 bodies were found on the ground. These attackers were found in uniform with arms and organized in a military organisation in platoons with G3 rifles," Kuol said.

Jonglei state has experienced multiple deadly clashes involving the Lou Nuer, the Dinka Hol, and other tribes this year.

The area has long been the scene of violent cattle raids between the groups. Southern Sudanese officials say northern Sudan's ruling party is organizing the attacks to spark conflict and undermine the 2005 peace deal that ended Sudan's civil war, which calls for the semi-autonomous south to vote on full independence in 2011.

The National Congress Party has repeatedly denied the accusations.
