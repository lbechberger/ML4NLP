A referendum was held in Costa Rica in order to approve or reject DR-CAFTA. 52% of the citizens voted "yes". This free trade agreement between the United States, Central American countries and Dominican Republic was negotiated between 2003 and 2004, and most of those countries ratified it in 2005; only Costa Rica did not join it until today.

Costa Rican president Óscar Arias, his allies in Legislative Assembly and employers organizations support the treaty, but it is opposed by unions and the second political force in Assembly, Citizen Action Party (PAC), among other organizations.

The referendum caused a scandal when it was discovered an e-mail that then-current Vicepresident Kevin Casas and Deputy Fernando Sánchez send to President, proposing dirty tactics in the campaign to promote CAFTA. Casas had to resign.
