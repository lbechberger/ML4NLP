Aerial photos were released Friday of an uncontacted native group in Brazil. The pictures were taken along the Peruvian border near the Envira River. According to David Hill, a researcher at Survival International, these are the first photos taken in the area for 20 years.

They were taken by a collaborative effort of the Brazilian National Indian Foundation (Fundação Nacional do Índio, or FUNAI) and the Special Secretariat of Indigenous People of the Government of Acre. FUNAI has been keeping tribes under surveillance in this area for the last 20 years but does not make contact with such groups. FUNAI also helps to prevent invasion of their lands to ensure their autonomy.

An estimated 500 natives live in the area near the Envira River, which is being threatened by commercial logging operations.

The pictures, taken by a helicopter flying overhead, show a group of men painted red and pointing bows and arrows towards the helicopter. FUNAI officials state that the group live in six longhouses. They do not know what tribe the group belongs to.

The pictures were taken in order to show the world that these uncontacted people exist. Such tribes are under risk from reduction in their land, disease, and invasion.
