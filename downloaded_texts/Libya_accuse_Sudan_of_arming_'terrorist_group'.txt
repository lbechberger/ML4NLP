Libya asked the Sudanese military attache to leave following accusations yesterday that Sudan was arming an Islamist "terrorist group" in control of Libya's capital, Tripoli.

Libya's government, currently located in the eastern city of Tobruk, say a Sudanese transport plane entered Libyan airspace on Thursday bound for Tripoli's Matiga airport, before making a refueling stop at the southern town of Kufra. During an inspection at Kufra, ammunition was found which Libya accused Sudan of intending to supply to the rebels.

Sudan have denied the accusation, claiming the ammunition was intended for a joint border force of the two countries targeting smuggling and human trafficking. Libya have said they had not given permission for the plane to enter the country's airspace.

An international arms embargo, first imposed during the 2011 Libyan uprising, is still in effect. A statement from the Libyan government made reference to this, saying the incident "represents a clear violation of international resolutions".

Algeria and Tunisia are both reinforcing their borders with Libya, following an arms-smuggling incident. The US has previously accused Egypt and the United Arab Emirates of launching aerial attacks on Tripoli.
