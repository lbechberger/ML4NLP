The annual Lord Mayor's Show went ahead today in London, continuing a centuries old tradition. Severe weather forced the cancellation of the fireworks display for the first time in twenty years, but thousands of people turned out to watch the procession.

The newly elected Lord Mayor of the City of London has journeyed through central London every year since 1215. The ceremony has only been cancelled once, in 1852 for the Duke of Wellington's funeral. Nick Anstee was appointed as the 682nd person to hold the position on Friday.

Saturday's show was opened by a flypast from the Royal Air Force. Anstee himself is the son of an RAF pilot, and tried to get into the service. On failing the entrance exams, he moved into finance.

Next floats and over 6,000 people began the procession from the City of London to the Royal Courts of Justice. This included 2,000 servicemen and women, as well as the Lord Mayor in the 252-year-old gold State Coach. At the Royal Courts of Justice the Lord Mayor then pledged his allegiance to the Crown.

Anstee described the show as "fantastic", and stated his intention to help restore trust in the financial services of the City.
