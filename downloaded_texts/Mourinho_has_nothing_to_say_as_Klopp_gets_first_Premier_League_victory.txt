Yesterday, Liverpool F.C. defeated Chelsea F.C. 3–1 in the English Premier League football match held at Stamford Bridge stadium. This was the sixth defeat of the season for Chelsea manager José Mourinho and the first victory for recently-appointed Liverpool manager Jürgen Klopp in a Premier League match. Throughout the match Liverpool, nicknamed The Reds had much more possession of the ball than Chelsea. 30 fouls were committed, including 21 by Liverpool, and five yellow cards were handed out with four going to Liverpool.


Brazilian Ramires scored in the opening minutes of the game with a header from César Azpilicueta's corner kick. Coutinho committed a foul on Willian and was shown a yellow card. Later, in the injury time of the first half of the game, Coutinho scored a goal, providing the equaliser for Klopp's side. The first half ended with both teams level at 1–1.

In the 65th minute, Chelsea striker Diego Costa avoided a red card for a brutal foul on Martin Škrtel. Coutinho scored a second goal in the 74thminute, assisted by Christian Benteke, providing Liverpool with a 2–1 lead. Benteke further widened the gap in the 83rd minute, with help from Jordon Ibe.

Coutinho was awarded the Man of the Match award. This was the 400th Premier League cap of Liverpool winger James Milner. 

After the match, Klopp expressed admiration for Mourinho saying "he's one of the best in the world." Mourinho repeatedly refused to say anything in a post-match interview. He is under pressure because Chelsea, the defending champions, are fighting and earlier this week, they lost to Stoke City 5–4 in a penalty shoot-out in the 2015-16 Football League Cup.

Chelsea are scheduled to face Ukrainian club Dynamo Kiev in a UEFA Champions League fixture on Wednesday, November 4. Meanwhile Liverpool will be travelling to Russia on Thursday, November 5, to play against Rubin Kazan in the Europa League.
