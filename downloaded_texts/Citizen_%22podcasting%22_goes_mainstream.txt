Infinity broadcasting, one of the largest radio companies in the U.S.A., announced its KYOU Radio, the world's first-ever podcasting radio station, began broadcasting on Monday, May 16 at 9:00 a.m., ET. The podcasts will also be available on San Francisco's KYCY-AM at 1550 AM.

The new format allows any listener to create a podcast and upload it to the station. Infinity said that its "All Podcast" format, "is going to give voice to your vision." Infinity will try to sell advertising on the programs, though they do not plan to pay the podcasters for their work.

Audio Wikinews is among other individually-produced content which will be featured on the station.
