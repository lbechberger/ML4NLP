Shortly before midnight on May 13, Victoria Police intercepted a car on Clarendon Street in South Melbourne, Australia. A search revealed drugs and firearms in the vehicle and police took two people into custody while the third fled on foot.

Police called for assistance to search for the man, who ran along York Street to a service station at the intersection of Kings Way, where he attempted to board a taxi.

It is believed the man was armed and fled north along Kings Way and when he was underneath the West Gate overpass, shots were exchanged between police on scene and the man.

As a result, a senior constable was shot in the leg and the suspect was shot and died on scene. His identity currently remains unknown. 

The police officer was taken to the The Alfred Hospital in a stable condition with minor injuries.
