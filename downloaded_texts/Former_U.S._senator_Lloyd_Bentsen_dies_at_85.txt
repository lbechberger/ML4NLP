According to family, former United States senator for Texas and former Treasury Secretary, Lloyd Bentsen has died at the age of 85 in his home located in Houston, Texas.

Bentsen is most famous for his words during a Vice Presidential debate on October 5, 1988. Indiana Senator Dan Quayle, the Republican candidate for Vice President, compared his congressional experience to that of former President John F. Kennedy when he sought the presidency. Bentsen replied, "Senator, I served with Jack Kennedy. I knew Jack Kennedy. Jack Kennedy was a friend of mine. Senator, you are no Jack Kennedy." The sharp rebuke, however, didn't save Bentsen, as George H.W. Bush and Quayle defeated Michael Dukakis and Bentsen in the 1988 elections.

In 1998, Bentsen suffered a small stroke, which he said was caused by a 3-month long trip to 15 different nations. 

"I enjoy challenges and being involved," Bentsen said.

Bentsen was born on February 11, 1921 and represented the state of Texas for 28 years.
