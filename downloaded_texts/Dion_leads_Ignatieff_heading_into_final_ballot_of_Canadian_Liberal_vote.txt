Former environment minister StÃ©phane Dion has overtaken former frontrunners Michael Ignatieff and Bob Rae to take the lead on the third ballot of the Liberal Party of Canada leadership convention. Dion now leads with 1,782 votes (37%) to Ignatieff's 1,660 votes (35.5%).

With 1,375 votes (28.5%) Rae was the last candidate on the ballot and has been eliminated by the contest. He has released his delegates and has decided not to announce his voting intention for the fourth and final ballot.

Former leadership contestants Joe Volpe and Ken Dryden, both of whom endorsed Rae after their withdrawal from the contest are now supporting Dion while Scott Brison who withdrew from the race last night to support Rae is now supporting Ignatieff. Former finance minister Ralph Goodale who endorsed Rae earlier in the week has thrown his support to Dion. 

The results of the final ballot are expected to be announced around 5pm Eastern Time.
