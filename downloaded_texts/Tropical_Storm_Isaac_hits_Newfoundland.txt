Hurricane Isaac was downgraded to a tropical storm as it hit Newfoundland today. Isaac was located about 120 miles south of Cape Race, Newfoundland, at 2 p.m. AST, and moving to the north-northeast at 40 mph. Isaac had top sustained winds near 60 mph with higher gusts. Tropical Storm Isaac swirled away from the island and weakened quickly.

"Isaac has weakened from a hurricane to a tropical storm this morning," the National Hurricane Center in Florida announced in a storm bulletin posted at 11 a.m. "The tropical storm continues racing towards Newfoundland and should cross the Avalon Peninsula, the southeastern region of Newfoundland this afternoon, where a tropical storm warning remains in effect.

"Isaac is a very small storm and its effects may not be felt across the entire Avalon. Accordingly, we no longer expect tropical storm force winds in regions beyond the Avalon Peninsula. Once a Category 1 hurricane as it formed in the Atlantic Ocean, Isaac has weakened considerably," said the Canadian Hurricane Centre based in Halifax, Nova Scotia.

Isaac's rain was heavy in the Atlantic province but minor damage was made.
