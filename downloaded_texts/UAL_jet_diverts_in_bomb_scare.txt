66 passengers and the crew of a New York to San Francisco UAL flight got an unwanted stop in the "Windy City," Chicago, on Tuesday, following a bomb scare.

United Air Lines spokesman Jeff Green said a flight attendant was alerted by a passenger to another passenger's suspicious materials and wires. The crew decided to divert the flight to O’Hare, empty the plane, and allow the bomb squad to inspect for safety.

They discovered vials of herbal liquids, some wires, and an MP3 player. “Nothing detrimental,” according to Chicago police.

The passenger and music player were reunited, everybody re-boarded the aircraft, and with three hours lost, the flight took off for San Francisco.
