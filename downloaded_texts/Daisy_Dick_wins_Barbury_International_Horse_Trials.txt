Daisy Dick has won the Barbury Castle International CCI 3* horse trials on Spring Along, her 16-year old veteran horse.

Andrew Nicholson came second on Neroe, with Sam Watson on Bushman came third. Badminton Horse Trials winner Oli Townend disappointed fans, gathering 19 penalties in show jumping on Flint Curtis.

Daisy Dick said "I was happy with my dressage as I knew he can do a good test, I'm just glad he decided to do it here! I'm annoyed with my time penalty but I know exactly where I lost the time - just one too many pulls but I did feel really fast - he was like a rocket! It was a big build up through the day in the horse boxes and its always a hell of a buzz here at Barbury so wouldn't want to be on any other horse. He really deserves the win today, it's about time as we've been second so many times. He's feeling so well - more like an eight-year-old and he was brilliant today."
