A skirmish has occurred between patrol boats of the Korean People's Navy of North Korea and the South Korean Republic of Korea Navy in the Yellow Sea. According to a South Korean naval official, the North Korean vessel took "considerable damage."

According to the Yonhap, the South Korean news agency, the battle began just after 11:30am local time, near the islands of Baengnyeong and Daecheong when a North Korean patrol vessel strayed over a disputed maritime demarcation line know as the Northern Limit Line (NLL). The South Korean vessel issued warning broadcasts, which were ignored and began to fire warning shots.

"A North Korean patrol ship crossed the Northern Limit Line and did not cease when we fired warning shots," a military source said, as quoted by Yonhap. "There were no casualties on our side while the North Korean boat, half-destroyed, sailed back to the North." 

According to the unnamed naval official, "The North Koreans then opened fire on the South Korean boat." He further added, "The battle itself lasted no more than a minute." The official noted that, "It wasn't a close-range battle. We fired heavily on the North Korean vessel."

North Korea contests that their ship crossed the border, and is seeking an apology, according to the Korean Central News Agency. "The South Korean military authorities should make an apology to the North side for the armed provocation and take a responsible measure against the recurrence of the similar provocation," stated North Korea's military supreme command. This is the latest exchange between the two countries along their western sea border since intense battles in 1992 and 2002.
