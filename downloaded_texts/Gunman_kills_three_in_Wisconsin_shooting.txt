The Associated Press reported early Friday that a camouflaged gunman opened fire, killing three, on a northeast Wisconsin river Thursday night.

A fourth person was wounded when the gunman opened fire at about 5:30 p.m. The four victims had gathered to go swimming near the East Kingsford railroad bridge over the Menominee River near Niagara, Wisconsin. The river forms the border between Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.

The suspect used a military-style assault rifle from a distance of 7 to 10 feet from one victim, Marinette County Sheriff Jim Kanikula said.

The Associated Press reports that a manhunt involving over 100 officers from more than 10 agencies searched for a man described as a "middle-age man who was last seen near the town of Niagara."

The alleged gunman, Scott J. Johnson, 38, of Iron Mountain, Michigan was taken into custody at about 8:30 a.m. local time approximately 100 yards from the bridge where the shootings occurred, according to early reports.

The Daily News reported that the suspect surrendered into police custody. At 9:43 a.m. the search was ended by authorities after a suspect was captured just after 9:00 a.m. CDT Friday. At 12:25 p.m., the Star Tribune released the name of alleged gunman.

The Star Tribune and the Associated Press reported the names of the victims: Tiffany Pohlson, 17, Anthony Spigarelli, 18, and Bryan Mort, 19. Twenty-year-old Daniel Louis Gordon was wounded. All were from Michigan.

The four victims were part of a group of nine young adults by the bridge. The Star Tribune reports that there was no communication between the attacker and the group.

Johnson is in the Marinette County Jail awaiting an arraignment hearing that has yet to be scheduled.

Agence France-Presse reports that about 30 people were evacuated from the area.

Niagara is about 210 miles north of Milwaukee, across the state line from Michigan's Upper Peninsula.
