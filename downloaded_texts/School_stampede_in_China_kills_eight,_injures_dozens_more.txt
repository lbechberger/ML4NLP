State media reported earlier today that a stampede in a school in China has killed at least eight people and injured an additional 26.

The accident occurred at 21:10 local time at the Yucai Middle School, a privately-run institution in city of Xiangxiang, located in the Hunan Province. Reports say that several students were leaving their studies when one fell down a staircase, causing others to lose their balance and tumble down as well.

Those hurt in the incident were treated at three hospitals in the town, and eight other students were being observed by medical personnel despite appearing not to have been hurt.

Chinese officials are investigating the incident and have been questioning the city educational bureau and local school authorities, according to the Xinhua news agency.
