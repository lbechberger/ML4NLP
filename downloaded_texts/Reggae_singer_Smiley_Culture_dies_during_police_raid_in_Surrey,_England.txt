David Emmanuel, a British reggae singer known as Smiley Culture, has died during a police raid at his home in Surrey, England. The singer is believed to have died from a stab wound when the Metropolitan police arrived at his house at 07:00 (GMT). Emmanuel, aged 48, was due to face trial for conspiracy to supply cocaine next week.

It is unclear how Emmanuel received the stab wound but investigators from the Independent Police Complaints Commission are looking to see if it was self-inflicted. Mike Franklin, the South East IPCC commissioner, released a statement saying "We will be looking into the planning of the arrest, the way in which it was carried out and the actions of all the officers who were present at the time of the incident."

A spokesman at Scotland Yard made a statement, "As part of an ongoing operation, officers from the Metropolitan police service's serious and organised crime command attended a residential address in east Surrey to carry out an arrest warrant. While they were at the address, an incident occurred during which a 48-year-old man died. Officers from Surrey police attended the incident and it has been formally referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission."

Emmanuel reached fame during the 1980s. His two biggest hits were "Cockney Translation" and "Police Officer", the latter reaching number 12 in the UK singles chart.
