The body of a 28-year-old Pakistani journalist was found in his home in Lahore, Pakistan on Friday.

The Pakistani police stated the journalist, Faisal Qureshi, who was working for a London-based online site, The London Post, was murdered on Friday in the early morning.

Zahid Ahmed, a brother of the deceased, told police his brother had been "receiving threats" and "was a victim of targeted killing". He did not accuse anyone specifically.

Investigators have said the journalist was found with visible torture marks, as well as numerous stab wounds.

Zahid told police he hurried to his brother’s place late Thursday after his brother failed to answer his phone. Police have stated Faisal’s laptop computer and phone were missing at the scene of the crime.

The independent New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) called on Friday for an independent inquiry into the death.
