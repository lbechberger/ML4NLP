The Film Federation of India confirmed today that Rakeysh Mehra's Rang De Basanti would be India's entry for the Best Foreign Film Award at the Oscars. The Aamir Khan starring blockbuster has received much critical acclaim and the story (dealing with "new-age" nationalism) reportedly struck a chord with millions of viewers, both in India and abroad. 

A 12-member panel including Basu Chatterjee, Kalpana Lajmi, N Chandra, Aadesh Srivastava and Ved Rahi selected Rang De Basanti from a line-up of Bollywood hits, including Omkara, Lage Raho Munnabhai, Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna and Krrish. Only three Indian films- Lagaan (2001), Mother India (1957), and Salaam Bombay (1988) have made it to the Academy Awards short-list thus far.
