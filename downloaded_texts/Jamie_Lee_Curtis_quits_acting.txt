Jamie Lee Curtis, 47, has stated that she will end her acting career, but said that she will continue writing.

"I'm not an actor anymore," she told Access Hollywood host Nancy O'Dell. "I really don't imagine I'll do that again." She later said in the conversation, "I'm just focused on my family and just can't imagine anything that's going to pull me away from them right now."

Curtis appeared on the Access Hollywood show to promote her newest children's book, Is There a Human Race?. The interview she participated in with O'Dell will appear on the show's weekend episode.

The picture book writer had this to say about ending her acting career, "No. I don't want to be somebody else anymore."

The last film Curtis starred in was the 2005 film The Kid &amp; I.
