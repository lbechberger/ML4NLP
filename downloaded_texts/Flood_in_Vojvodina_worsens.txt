The flood in northern Serbian province Vojvodina worsens as the river Tamiš rises further. The river flooded 10 days ago, covering the Јaša Tomić village. More then 200 houses were destroyed and around 800 are flooded, forcing 3235 people to evacuate. The flood was caused by heavy rain in Serbia and Romania. Meteorologists say that Tamiš level will get lower in the following days.

Serbian army and volunteers are helping local residents, building a dike and saving the animals, but the villagers are short on drinking water and other supplies. There are no human casualties. The People's Office of the President of Serbia has started an aid drive to help Јaša Tomić.
