The American domestic diva Martha Stewart was today released from prison after a five-month stint at the Alderson Federal Prison Camp in West Virginia. She will continue the rest of her sentence with an electronic tag for the next five months under house arrest. 

Martha Stewart was sentenced to five months in prison, a further five months under tag and fined US$30,000 for charges of conspiracy and obstruction stemming from insider trading in ImClone shares after the company's wonder drug Erbitux lost its FDA licence.
