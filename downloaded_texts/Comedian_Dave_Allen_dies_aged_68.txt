The famous Irish comedian Dave Allen has died aged 68. Known as the Sit-down comedian, Allen was among the first to base his dry wit humour around the comic practices of large organisations and institutions such as the Catholic Church. 

Born in Dublin in 1936, he later moved to England to pursue his career. He initially was a journalist, but later entered comedy. His fame peaked in the 1970s and 1980s with the BBC TV shows The Dave Allen Show and Dave Allen at Large.

He is survived by his wife Karin, and their three children.
