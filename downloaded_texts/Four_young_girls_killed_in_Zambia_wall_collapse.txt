Four young girls were killed and six more people injured when a brick wall collapsed on top of them in Zambia. The victims had been trying to reach a free mosquito net handout when a stampede erupted, causing the collapse.

The accident occurred in the town of Mpika, where the Ministry of Health was conducting the handout as part of an anti-malaria initiative. As people flocked to the community hall where the event was taking place, people outside the premises began climbing the walls in an effort to get in, initiating the collapse.

The four girls died on the spot in the incident, which occurred at around 17:30 local time. Six others were taken to the local Mpika District Hospital, where they were treated for their injuries, which are believed to be non life-threatening.
