President Bush gave a speech that unveiled a "surge" strategy plan for the Iraq War. His plan involves sending 21,500 more troops into Iraq. He and Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki have sent benchmarks for the Iraqi government to accomplish. These benchmarks include increasing the Iraqi Army's size and appointing a head general of the army and two deputy generals. The increase in troops would be used to occupy areas after they have been cleared from insurgents.

Republicans on the Armed Services Committee voiced support for the plan. “To my colleagues, I would ask, at least in the short term here, that we measure our words, that we not... declare the war lost when it’s not yet lost," said Senator Lindsey Graham "or to embrace strategies that would lead to defeat.”
