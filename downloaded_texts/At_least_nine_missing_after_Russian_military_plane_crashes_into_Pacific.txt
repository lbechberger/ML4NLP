A Russian military plane crashed today in the Pacific Ocean. At least nine are missing after the turboprop went down in the Strait of Tartary, which is located in the far east of the country.

The Tupolev Tu-142 maritime reconnaissance/anti-submarine aircraft, which is based on the Tu-95 strategic bomber, was reported by RIA Novosti as carrying "at least nine people" according to an unnamed military source. The BBC asserted that there were eleven on board, but did not attribute the number to anyone.

A Defense Ministry statement said the plane was lost from radar during a training exercise over the strait, which lies between the mainland and Sakhalin. Search and rescue is ongoing for the crew around the reported crash site.

An object that may be the fuselage has been located in water 44 meters (144 feet) deep, according to one report. Russia's Pacific Fleet has ceased all flights while the accident is investigated.
