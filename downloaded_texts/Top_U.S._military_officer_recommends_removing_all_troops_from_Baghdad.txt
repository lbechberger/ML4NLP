Columnist Mark Shields has revealed that one of the "highest ranking men" in the military has recommended removing 'all' U.S. troops from Baghdad.

He explained that the unnamed officer wanted to withdraw from Baghdad itself, but secure the road to the airport and the oil fields, leaving policing Baghdad to the Iraqis.

The comments come as the U.S. is taking heat for its alleged Salvador Option targeting the Sunni insurgency with death squads, which opponents believe contributed to the sectarian war.
