The Director of public prosecutions in England and Wales are going to seek a retrial for three men who are thought to have been involved in a plot to attempt to bomb transatlantic flights.

Ibrahim Savant and Arafat Khan are both 28 years old. Waheed Zaman is 25 years old. All of the men were recently found "not guilty" of attempting to bomb aircrafts. A spokesman for the Director of Public Prosecutions, Keir Starmer, confirmed that he will be seeking a retrial.

On Monday, a jury in Woolwich Crown Court in London, England failed to reach verdicts for the three men, based on charges of conspiracy to murder, which is why the Director of Public Prosecutions of England and Wales is seeking a retrial.

Starmer said: "My task is to judge whether, taking into account all relevant considerations, the public interest is better served in this particular case by offering no evidence or by seeking a further retrial. Having regard to the very serious nature of the charge and the very considerable public interest in having the allegation determined by a jury one way or the other, I have concluded that, in this exceptional case, it is in the public interest to seek a further retrial."
