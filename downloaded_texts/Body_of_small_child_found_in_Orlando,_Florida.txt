Police in Orlando, Florida have found the skeletal remains of a small child just a half mile from the location where 3-year-old Caylee Anthony went missing in June. According to WFTV, the remains appear to be that of Anthony, however there have been no confirmed reports from police regarding the find.

According to reports, the body was found just after 9:30 a.m. Eastern Standard Time in the woods near the intersection of Chickasaw Trail and Suburban Drive in Orlando, when an electric company meter reader found a bag. When he opened it a skull fell onto the ground. WFTV says when police arrived on the scene, they called Equusearch, a specialized search and recovery team from Texas, and spoke to the company's founder Tim Miller, saying "it looks like we got her".

Caylee has been missing since June 9, but police were not notified of her disappearance until July 15. Caylee's mother Casey, 22, was charged with her daughter's murder after authorities found evidence of a decomposing body in Casey's car.

Yesterday, Casey's lawyer, Jose Baez, said that there was evidence that Caylee was still alive. He presented a photo to the courts that a woman took at a shopping center that he says appears to be Caylee. He has asked a judge to order that the security camera footage be released for examination.
