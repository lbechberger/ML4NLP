Pop-singer Britney Spears, 24, announced last night on the Late Show With David Letterman that she is pregnant again.

"So, we've established now that you are in fact pregnant, is that right?" asked Letterman.

"Yes, sir," replied Spears. She added, "Don't worry, Dave, it's not yours."

Spears gave birth to her son Sean Preston last September after marrying back-up dancer Kevin Federline, 28, in November 2004. This will be Spears' second child and Federline's fourth.

In 2004, shortly after the birth of her son, Spears put her singing career on hold to raise him. Her last album to be released was her "greatest hits" album in 2004.

In February, a photo of Spears was taken while she was driving her car with her son in her lap. In April, her son allegedly fell from a high chair, hitting his head and prompting Child Welfare agents to go to her home. No charges have been filed in either case.
