ABC News has obtained and released a transcript of a taped message from Osama Bin Laden.

Osama bin Laden's first video in almost three years has surfaced but has mixed reviews in the Arab world. Al Qaeda supporters are enthused by the video coinciding with the 6th anniversary of the September 11, 2001 attacks, but other parts of the Muslim world seemed worried that the video may spawn new attacks creating more instability in the region than there already is.
