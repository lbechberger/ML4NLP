At least 264 people were killed, said Interior Minister Idris Naim Sahin, in a 7.2 magnitude earthquake that struck Turkey yesterday. The quake was the strongest to hit Turkey in ten years. The city of Van has been heavily affected. The death toll was expected to rise.

A number of aftershocks has rattled Turkey since then, with the strongest one having a magnitude of 6.0. Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan reported 55 buildings destroyed in Ercis, north of Lake Van. He said "because the buildings" in affected villages not yet reached "are made of adobe, they are more vulnerable to quakes. I must say that almost all buildings in such villages are destroyed."

Rescue efforts are being affected due to power outages due to power line damage from the quake.

Over 1,300 people were reported injured.
