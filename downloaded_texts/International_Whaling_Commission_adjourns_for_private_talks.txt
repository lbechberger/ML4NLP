A meeting of the International Whaling Commission in the South Korean city of Ulsan has adjourned for private talks with commissioners. The commission had been about to vote on a Japanese plan to increase its minke whale catch and to start hunting humpback whales.

Australia attempted to stop the adjournment accusing Japan of trying to stall the vote.

Nauru, The Gambia, and Togo applied to join the commission last week, but have no voting rights until their membership payments are cleared, which could happen any time during the IWC meeting. The three countries are expected to follow Japan's pro-whaling line.

The 66 member body is currently evenly split between pro- and anti-whaling countries.
