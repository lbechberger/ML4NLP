A Pakistani boy got his older sister to hang him in the same manner as Saddam Hussein.

Mubashar Ali, 9, hanged himself, while re-enacting Hussein's hanging with the help of elder sister, 10, after tying a rope to a ceiling fan and his neck in his home in the Punjab district of Rahimyar Khan on Sunday, said a local police official. 

The father of the deceased boy said that his children had been watching the video of Saddam Hussein's execution on television and attempted to imitate the hanging as other family members thought they were playing in another room. 

"My wife and sister rushed to rescue Mubashar when children cried for help from the adjoining room, but he died due to hanging," said Alamgir Paracha, father of Mubashar. 

Police said that the death was accidental and a case of parental negligence. 

"It was an accident which happened due to carelessness of parents," said district police chief Sultan Ahmad.
