A bus bombing in Sri Lanka has killed at least 25 and wounded at least 40.

The bomb exploded just outside the capital city, Sri Jayawardenapura-Kotte, with the wounded transported to nearby Kalubovila hospital. The explosion occurred during the evening rush hour.

"It's a parcel bomb of about 3kg (6 lbs) with a time device. It was placed in the middle of the bus," said a bomb squad official to Reuters.

As well as wounds sustained from the explosion, several passengers were burned after the commuter bus caught fire straight after the explosion.

The government has blamed the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE)
for the bombing.

"It's definitely by the LTTE, with the recent losses and battlefield defeats they are desperate," said Brigadier Udaya Nanayakkara, a spokesperson for the military.

Fighting between the government forces and the LTTE has escalated since a cease-fire ended in January.
