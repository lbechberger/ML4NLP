A 67-year-old man, Thomas Ouellette, of Bonita Springs, Florida was questioned by the FBI Monday after he brought fireworks onto an airliner. Piedmont Airlines flight 4126, a Bombardier Dash 8, from Baltimore, Maryland landed safely and without complications in New York's LaGuardia Airport. No suspicions were raised until cleaning crews found the pyrotechnics on the airplane.

The fireworks are currently being held as evidence by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey police, owner of LaGuardia Airport. Ouellette has been issued a summons to appear in federal court. Pyrotechnics are banned on American flights and individuals face a $10,000 civil penalty for bringing them on board.

This case comes after an incident on December 25 when Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, a Nigerian national, attempted to bomb an airliner with explosives concealed in his underpants.
