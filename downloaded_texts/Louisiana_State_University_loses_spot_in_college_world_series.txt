Louisiana State University's (LSU's) baseball team lost against the Stony Brook Seawolves on Sunday in game 3 of the Baton Rouge Super Regional. The final score was 7–2. This loss closed out LSU's chances to compete in the US College World Series, but will send the Seawolves to compete in that major event.

Game 1 of the series included a 19-hour rain delay, but ultimately, LSU won that game 5–4. The game was a loss for Stony Brook pitcher Frankie Vanderka. Game 3, however, gave Vanderka an opportunity to redeem himself. Game 2 resulted in a loss for LSU, by two runs.

Stony Brook showed its strong hitting capabilities early in game 3 by scoring the first run in the top of the first inning. Even with strong hitter Mason Katz, LSU was unable to stage a notable come back. In the 6th inning of game 3, Stony Brook pitcher Frankie Vanderka quickly dispatched three of the LSU Tigers, helping to maintain Stony Brook's position. LSU scored its second and final run for the game in the seventh inning.
