Yesterday in La Molina, Spain, IPC Alpine World Championships event organizers changed the competition owing to poor weather predicted later in the week with the Super-G now set to be run today.

Skiers were expecting to have the day off, with a Sport Forum originally on the schedule for today and the Super-G on the schedule for tomorrow. Some skiers competing were not scheduled to arrive in La Molina until today. 

The race is scheduled to start at 10:30 European Central Standard Time. There are 6 scheduled starters for the women's visually impaired group including yesterday's downhill gold medalist Henrieta Farkašová, 11 women in the standing group, 8 women in the sitting group, 16 men in the visually impaired group including Spaniards Jon Santacana and Gabriel Gorce, 22 men in the standing group including Australian Mitchell Gourley and New Zealander Adam Hall, and 29 men in the sitting group
