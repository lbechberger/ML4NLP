Early Friday morning, John "Jebby" Ellis Bush, the 21 year old son of Florida Governor Jeb Bush, was arrested in Austin, Texas for public intoxication and resisting arrest. Roger Wade, Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission spokesman, said Bush was apprehended at 2:30AM near the corner of Trinity and Sixth Street in the city's downtown entertainment and bar district.

Jeb and Columbia Bush's youngest son allegedly wobbled up to TABC and Austin police on duty in the city's downtown entertainment district and began badgering police about an earlier arrest of people he knew. TABC agent Capt. David Ferrero said Bush appeared to be drunk and "was observed to be a danger to himself and others."

According to the arrest affidavit, "Subject further resisted by pushing back with his body as he was restrained at the [Austin Police Department] transport van." During the scuffle, Bush suffered a cut on his chin and was transported to Breckenridge Hospital where he was treated and released. Bail was set at $2,500, but Bush was released on his own recognizance later about 10:30AM. If he fails to appear for court, he will forfeit the bond. Austin law classifies Public Intoxication as a Class C misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of up to $500, while Resisting Arrest is a Class A misdemeanor, and is punishable by up to a year in jail.

Authorities were unaware of Bush's identity until after his arrest and booking when they observed his Florida Driver License. Governor Bush appearing with his wife at a Miami museum reception bristled at reporters' questions Friday evening when the issue was mentioned saying, "I'm not going to discuss it on the public square with 30 cameras."

Several members of the Bush family have received considerable press coverage for perceived or abusive use of alcohol and other substances, including George W. Bush's DUI, Jenna and Barbara Bush's underage drinking, and Jebby's sister Noelle arrest for forging a Xanax prescription.
