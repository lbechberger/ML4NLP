A six year old boy in the first grade at Downey Elementary School in Brockton, Massachusetts was suspended for touching a female classmate.

The boy allegedly touched the girl underneath the waistband of her pants briefly while in class. The boy was suspended for three days but hasn't returned afterwards because he feels uncomfortable about returning. His mother is trying to transfer him to another school.

The Brockton Superintendent of Schools, Basan Nembirkow, says "take all allegations of sexual harassment seriously and conduct investigations. The principal is trained to handle these situations and assisted as needed by the district sexual harassment officer."

A spokesperson for the Brockton Public Schools, Cynthia McNally, said "unfortunate this situation has gotten this kind of publicity...wouldn't have suspended the boy without conducting an investigation."
