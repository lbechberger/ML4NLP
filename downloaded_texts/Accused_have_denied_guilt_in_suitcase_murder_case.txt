Two men charged after the body of a Chinese student was stuffed into a suitcase and thrown into Auckland's harbour on Good Friday would deny their guilt, a court was told today.

One of them appeared in Auckland District Court today to be confronted with the charge of kidnapping a 19-year-old English language student, ransom and murder. The other accused appeared on a charge of hiding evidence for the murder. They have been granted name suppression until their next appearance in court. 

According to lawyers, pleas of not guilty would be entered.
