Just days after the bombings in the Egyptian resort town of Dahab, two more suicide bombers struck a Multinational Peacekeeping Forces base near the Gaza border. The attack occurred at around 1300 GMT. The number of casualties is not known at this time with the spokesperson for the Multinational Force and Observers (MFO) and Egyptian security forces giving conflicting reports. According to Major Nathan Bond, an MFO spokesman, no peacekeepers were injured in the attack. However, Egyptian security personnel maintain that one Norwegian, one New Zealander and four Egyptians were killed in the bombing.
