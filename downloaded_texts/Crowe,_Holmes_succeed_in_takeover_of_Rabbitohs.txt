Australian actor Russell Crowe and businessman Peter Holmes a Court have succeeded in their bid to take over the South Sydney Rabbitohs, an Australian National Rugby League (NRL) Club. The men required that 75% of the club's members vote yes on the $3 million takeover bid for it to pass; and it narrowly won, by just 32 votes (0.8%). Former Souths player and manager, George Piggins, has vowed never to attend another game of his former club.

Supporters of the bid have said it gives the Rabbitohs a chance to return to their glory days after last year's finish of 13th in the 15-team competition. The team has not won a Premiership in 35 years but still retains the record for most Premiership wins, with 20 on the record books. Those against the bid objected that the club is selling out 98 years of heritage.
