According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) National Weather Service, much of western Texas and southeastern New Mexico is under a "winter storm warning."

"A winter storm will continue to bring widespread snowfall to much of west Texas and southeastern New Mexico through Sunday morning," said the NOAA in a special weather statement.

Parts of NM could see three to six inches of snow "with isolated areas receiving six to eight inches of snow," added the statement. Some parts of NM have already seen just over a foot of snow with Red River picking up 13 inches. 

Western Texas could see three to six inches as well, with some areas picking up a little more. Seminole has reported only two inches of snow so far.

According to AccuWeather, the storm is expected to turn northeast and take a "track taking it west of the Appalachians Sunday night and Monday."
