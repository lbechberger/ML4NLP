Nelson Mandela has left hospital to return to his home in Johannesburg, in a critical condition, South African officials said on Sunday.

The 95-year-old anti-apartheid leader and former South African president has spent nearly three months in hospital for treatment of a recurring lung infection and has returned to his residence in Johannesburg where he will continue to recover.

A statement from the office of current South African president Jacob Zuma confirmed Mandela homecoming:

"His teams of doctors are convinced that he will receive the same level of intensive care at his Houghton home that he received in Pretoria."

"His home has been reconfigured to allow him to receive intensive care there. The health care personal providing care at his home are the very same who provided care to him in hospital."

Several ambulances and TV crews gathered outside Mandela's home in the Houghton suburb of Johannesburg on Sunday, where well-wishers gathered to pray for his recovery. 

Mandela's last public appearance was at the 2010 football World Cup, held in South Africa.
