After being down 2&ndash;0 at halftime, Brazil defeated the United States 3&ndash;2 in the final round of the 2009 FIFA Confederations Cup, claiming their third FIFA Confederations Cup finals victory.

The match was held at Coca-Cola Park in Johannesburg, South Africa. The FIFA Confederations Cup has been held there as a prelude to next year's 2010 FIFA World Cup.

The United States made its first appearance in any FIFA men's tournament final while Brazil made its fourth appearance in a Confederations Cup final (after 1997, 1999 and 2005). The victory may result in Brazil claiming the top position in FIFA's world football rankings.

The United States, the CONCACAF Gold Cup champions, qualified for the match by defeating Spain in the semifinal round by a score of 2&ndash;0, just days after nearly being eliminated from the tournament. Brazil qualified for the match by defeating South Africa 1&ndash;0 last Thursday in the second semifinal match. Brazil was the defending Confederations Cup champion having won in 2005 and winners of five World Cups.

Early goals by Clint Dempsey (10') and Landon Donovan (27') gave the United States a commanding 2&ndash;0 lead at halftime. Brazil quickly retaliated with two goals by Luís Fabiano (46' and 73') in the second half to tie the game. A goal by Lúcio (83') helped seal the comeback victory for the Brazilians while the team controlled the clock for the remaining ten minutes.

Eight saves by USA goalkeeper Tim Howard helped stifle the Brazilian offense for most of the match until the latter end of the match. Brazil attempted 24 shots with 11 on goal while USA attempted 8 with 4 on goal.
