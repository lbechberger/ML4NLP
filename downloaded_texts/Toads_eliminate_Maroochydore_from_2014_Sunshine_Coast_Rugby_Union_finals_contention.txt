Toads ended Maroochydore's chances of making the 2014 Sunshine Coast Rugby Union finals in Cotton Tree, Australia this afternoon. They defeated the reigning premiers 43 points to 12. 

A Maroochydore at 32 minutes suggested a fight back from three tries down but Toads would pile on four tries to one from there. Maroochydore's finals chances ended at eleven minutes to five local time (0649 UTC) with their final try. 

To qualify for the finals, Maroochydore needed to win both of its games and have other results go its way. They play the second-placed University next week in their final game of the season. Toads play Noosa next week and, in a minor semi final preview, Caloundra the week after.

In the weekends other A-grade game, Caloundra defeated Noosa 22â€“14.
