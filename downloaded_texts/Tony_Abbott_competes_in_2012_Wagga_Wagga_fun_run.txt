After the warm-up by the Workout Wagga girls, Abbott started at the front of the pack but was quickly overtaken by the faster runners, crossing the finishing line with a time of 46 minutes 49 seconds. After crossing the line Abbott mingled and posed for photographs with the public. Abbott was interviewed by Master of Ceremonies Leigh Spokes; when asked about the event, he stated that it was a "great community event" but found the course "hard going". Shortly after the interview and talking to people, Abbott and his advisors left the event due to his tight schedule.

A total of 2988 people competed, with 788 bicycle riders and 2200 runners and walkers, a 20 per cent increase from last year and making this year’s fun run the largest since the first Lake to Lagoon was held in 2006.

In the open men's category, first place went to James Davy who finished across the line at 30 minutes 15 seconds, second place went to Matthew Ho finishing in 31 minutes 16 seconds, and in third place was Caleb Noble at 31 minutes 50 seconds. 

In the open women's category, first place went to Rachel Stanton who finished across the line at 36 minutes 39 seconds, second place went to Carmel Kahlefeldt, and in third place was Jessie Wythes at 40 minutes 9 seconds.
