The International Monetary Fund and the European Union approved aid packages to help Georgia recover from its conflict with Russia, which occurred in early August. The IMF approved a US$750 million loan which will allow Georgia to rebuild its currency reserves. The European Union also approved an aid package of €500 million in aid by 2010, which is expected to help internally displaced people (IDPs) and economic recovery in the form of new infrastructure. Only €100 million of the EU aid will be given to Georgia this year.

These loans are aimed to restore confidence in Georgia's economy and send a signal to international investors that Georgia's economy is sound. According to the IMF, international investors have been "critical to Georgia's economic growth in recent years."

Takatoshi Kato, Deputy Managing Director and Acting Chairman of the IMF executive committee, said the loan will "make significant resources available to replenish international reserves and bolster investor confidence, with the aim of sustaining private capital inflows that have been critical to Georgia's economic growth in recent years."

Georgia has requested $2 billion in international aid to help it recover from the conflict. So far, the United States has pledged $1 billion in aid. Further assistance and loans to Georgia are expected from other organizations. Kato noted that "...Georgia is expected to receive financial assistance from multilateral and bilateral donors and creditors in support of the reconstruction effort." It is expected that an international donors' conference will take place next month to solicit more aid for the country. 

Georgia's government expects that economic growth will be more than cut in half as a result of the conflict. Last year, Georgia's GDP increased 12.4% and it is predicted by the IMF that growth will be less than 4 percent in the coming year.
