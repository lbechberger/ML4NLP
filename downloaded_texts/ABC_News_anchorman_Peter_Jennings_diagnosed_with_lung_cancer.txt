ABC News anchorman Peter Jennings was diagnosed this week with lung cancer. Despite beginning out-patient treatment next week which will involve chemotherapy, Jennings will continue to front ABC's 'World News Tonight' show, "to the extent he can do so comfortably", says ABC News.

"Almost 10 million Americans are living with cancer," Jennings told ABC staff on Tuesday. "I am sure I will learn from them how to cope with the facts of life that none of us anticipated." The 66-year-old anchor man, who gave up smoking several years ago, added: "I hope it goes without saying that a journalist who doesn't value deeply the audience's loyalty should be in another line of work."

Jennings began his career at ABC News in 1964 and in 1983 was made senior editor and anchor of World News Tonight. Due to ill health, he was unable to work during his network's special report on the recent death of Pope John Paul II.
