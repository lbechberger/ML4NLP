Aidan Burley, the Conservative Member of Parliament for Cannock Chase in Staffordshire, England, has been forced to leave his job as a Parliamentary Private Secretary to Justine Greening in the Department of Transport after pictures appeared in The Mail on Sunday newspaper showing him at a stag party in France with a man dressed in the uniform of a Nazi SS officer.

A spokesman for the Conservative Party said: "Aidan Burley has behaved in a manner which is offensive and foolish. That is why he is being removed from his post as parliamentary private secretary at the Department for Transport."

The Prime Minister has instructed the Conservative Party to conduct an investigation into Burley's behaviour.

Burley has made repeated apologies to the Jewish community. The Conservative Friends of Israel said he does "not have an antisemitic bone in his body". He offered an "unreserved, wholehearted and fulsome apology" in a letter to the Jewish Chronicle.
