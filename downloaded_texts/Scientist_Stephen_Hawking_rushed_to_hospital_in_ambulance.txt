Scientist Stephen Hawking, 67, has been taken to a hospital in an ambulance after falling very ill, reports Sky News.

According to a physicist at Cambridge University in the United Kingdom, "Professor Hawking is very ill" and had been rushed to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge to undergo tests.

His condition is not yet known, but according to the University, Hawking has been ill with a chest infection for a few weeks. On April 6, he cancelled an appearance at Arizona State University due to his illness. Hawking also suffers from severe motor neurone disease.

"He [Hawking] is undergoing tests. He has been unwell for a couple of weeks," said the university in a statement. In a later statement, the University stated that Hawking was resting comfortably "but will be kept in hospital overnight" for observation.

Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics head Peter Haynes offered his sympathy saying, "Professor Hawking is a remarkable colleague. We all hope he will be amongst us again soon." Hawking has worked in the same department as Haynes for over 30 years.
