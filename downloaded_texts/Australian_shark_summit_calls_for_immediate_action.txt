Experts from around the world met in Sydney, Australia yesterday for the nation’s first shark summit. 

Scientists gathered to compare notes on technologies that can best protect beach goers.There have been 13 shark attacks in NSW so far this year, up from three in 2014, and one death.

Australia has the highest rate of shark attacks in the world, and the Mark Baird government says it is dedicated to finding measures to protect swimmers and surfers from sharks.

Ahead of the summit, the Government released the options, identified by the review, that would be discussed and potentially trialled, including:

Clever buoys: An acoustic method designed to detect sharks at beaches where an array of buoys are deployed. Clever buoys use multi-beam sonar to identify underwater objects.

Smart drumlines: A drumline attached to an electronic GPS buoy. The buoy detects when a shark has been captured on the drumline and sends a message back to shore. Shark contractors can then immediately reposition and release the shark.

Electronic fencing/cables: Deterrent barriers provide an electric field that can provide protection for a whole beach. Sharks have highly sensitive receptors and electric barriers seek to exploit their sensory biology.

Shark shields: A personal deterrent that creates an electrical field in the water around a person that sharks can detect. Designed to be attached to surfboards but can also be fitted to ankles.

Shark repellents: A chemical deterrent in an aerosol can that contains the scent of decomposing shark tissue to repel other sharks.

However, the review found that only one deterrent — a shark spotting program — was suitable for immediate trial.The state government has shortlisted two technologies – clever buoys and smart drumlines – for trial implementation.
