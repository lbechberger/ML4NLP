missing image|Image:Kent Hovind.jpg|thumb|right|Mr Hovind In September Kent Hovind's Creation Science Evangelism (CSE) ministry filed several DMCA copyright complaints on YouTube causing the video-sharing website to ban several users. On 27 September 2007 an IP address belonging to CSE Enterprises removed all mention of the controversy from the Wikipedia article about Kent Hovind. The editor of the whitewashing included the edit summary, "Removed because their is no evidence that CSE requested accounts to be suspended. It is not certain if videos were part of public domain. This section is pure speculation and gossip."

Hovind, who is now serving ten years in federal prison, turned CSE over to his younger son, Eric Hovind, in January 2007. As previously reported, CSE claimed copyrights on critical videos that had material produced by Hovind and at least one video that contained no Hovind/CSE material despite CSE's website stating, "none of the materials ... are copyrighted."
