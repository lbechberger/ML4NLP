Billing records uncovered by the New York Times show that Fred Thompson was paid for about 20 hours of work as a Washington, DC lobbyist on behalf of a group to ease restrictive federal rules on abortion counseling in the 1990s. Recently Thompson "flatly denied" the charge and said he "did not recall doing any work for the organization."

The records show that Thompson worked part-time from 1991 to 1994 for the National Family Planning and Reproductive Health Association, and earned about US$5,000 for work he did in 1991 and 1992.

According to the Los Angeles Times, "a new Thompson spokeswoman, Burson Snyder, did not return calls for comment on the billing records Thursday."
