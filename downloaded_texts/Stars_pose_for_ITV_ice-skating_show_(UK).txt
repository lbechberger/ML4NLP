The celebrities taking part in a new entertainment show for ITV in UK, Dancing on Ice, today posed for the press at the Natural History Museum. The show will be presented by former champion ice skaters Torvill and Dean, reunited for the first time since 1999. Each celebrity will be partnered with a professional ice-skater to dance on ice each Saturday night, and will have to win votes from the public to continue on the show.



Phillip Schofield, who will present the show, announced the names of the stars as they posed for the press photographers. A few passers by took photos using their mobile phones.

The stars on the show include former England football goalkeeper David Seaman, the former children's tv presenter and now tv Exec Andi Peters, Olympic athlete Kelly Holmes, former It girl Tamara Beckwith and actor John Barrowman (who played "Captain" Jack in the recent Doctor Who tv series).
