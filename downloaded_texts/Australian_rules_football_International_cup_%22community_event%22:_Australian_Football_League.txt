The Australian Football League (AFL) has confirmed to Wikinews that the Australian Football International Cup has been played as a community event "with open access to enable any supporters of all teams to be able to attend." The preliminary games of the 2008 International Cup were played predominately at Royal Park, Melbourne with spectators able to watch without purchasing tickets.

"All matches in the past have been open through the preliminary rounds, with the Grand Final played at the MCG as a curtain-raiser to an AFL match [sic]," the AFL said in a statement.
