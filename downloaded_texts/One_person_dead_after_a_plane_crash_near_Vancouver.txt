One person was killed and two were injured when a small plane crashed into a residential tower shortly after taking off from Vancouver International Airport. 

The twin engine Piper Seneca hit the ninth floor of the 15-storey building in Richmond, where the airport is located, but it did not cause a fire.

The male pilot of the plane was killed, while two people in the building were hurt -- one seriously, the other suffering minor injuries.

The plane appears to have hit the building at an angle, with damage spread between the eighth and ninth floors.

The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating the cause of the crash.
