Eastleigh source--&gt; and the constituency has been in the Liberal Democrats' control since another by-election in 1994. The party's share of the vote dropped by 14.4 percentage points as UKIP posted their best-ever election results. 



UKIP leader Nigel Farage has said that after their success in the by-election they will "take the tremor that [they] have created at Eastleigh and turn it into a national political earthquake" in the European Parliament election in 2014. Farage said of Prime Minister David Cameron, "He's talking about gay marriage, wind turbines, unlimited immigration from India. He wants Turkey to join the European Union. The Conservatives' problems are not because of UKIP, it's because of their leader". 

Grant Shapps, the Conservative Party chairman, said "We'll be fighting the next election providing a clear choice between David Cameron as PM or [ Labour Party leader] Ed Miliband." David Cameron played down suggestions that UKIP pose a big threat to the Conservative Party at the 2015 General Election. He said, "It is a disappointing result for the Conservative Party, but it is clear that, in mid-term by-elections, people want to register a protest". 

The Labour candidate John O'Farrell ended up fourth with 9.82% of the vote. Ed Miliband responded by saying, "Clearly I would have preferred to get more votes but this was always going to be a tough fight for Labour". 

Chris Huhne, the former Secretary of State for Energy, triggered the election when he resigned as the after admitting perverting the course of justice by asking his wife to take speeding penalty points for him in 2003.
