Dominican comedian Freddy Beras-Goico has died at the age of 69 in the United States. Beras died at the Mount Sinai Medical Center on Thursday in New York. Admitted to the hospital on November 5, the comedian died on Thursday, three days before his 70th birthday, of pancreatic cancer.

Beras, who started his career as a cameraman in the 1960s, was also an actor and television presenter. As a child Beras fled Colombia with his family due to the dictatorship of Rafael Trujillo. During the 1950s and 60s he became a political activist and was jailed in 1965. He reached national fame when he began to present a weekly variety television programme. During its thirty year run the show featured some of the most famous musicians from the Dominican Republic and Latin America. 

Tributes have been paid to the late comedian. The president of the Dominican Republic, Leonel Fernandez, said that he spoke out against the social and political conflicts of the country. He added that "He appealed with energy and integrity for the construction of a better society."

His son posted an announcement through his Twitter page. He said "It is with great pain that I announce the death of my father. Infinite thanks to all for your solidarity in these days. Peace to his remains."

His funeral is to take place in the Dominican Republic and his body is due to return there today.
