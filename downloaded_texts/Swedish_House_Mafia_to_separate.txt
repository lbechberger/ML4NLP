Swedish-based house music group Swedish House Mafia have announced their intention to disband after their next tour. A statement from the group said "the tour we are about to go on will be our last".

The group, which consists of DJs Axwell, Steve Angello and Sebastian Ingrosso, formed in 2008, with its members initially DJing in a pizza shop in the Swedish capital in the early 2000s. In a statement on their website, the group expressed their appreciation to their supporters. "We want to thank every single one of you that came with us on this journey," the group statement reads. "We came, we raved, we loved."

Swedish House Mafia appeared at Radio 1's Hackney Weekend at the weekend. The group also announced future tour dates, including Ushuaia on the Spanish island of Ibiza from July 4 to August 29, the Friends Arena in Sweden on November 24 and the National Bowl in the British town of Milton Keynes on July 14, the latter of which the page says will be the group's final night in the United Kingdom. "The final leg of this journey will be announced in August," the statement reads.

Last week, Ingrosso told Rolling Stone magazine of his interest in having Beatles member Paul McCartney collaborate with Swedish House Mafia, describing The Beatles' music as "kind of melancholic to sad and happy combined", calling it "just amazing". Ingrosso believed "what the Beatles have done is what we do today. [It] doesn't matter that we do dance music". Below is an image gallery of the members of Swedish House Mafia:
