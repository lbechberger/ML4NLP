Sidney Crosby became the youngest player in NHL history to score 100 points in two consecutive seasons, and the Pittsburgh Penguins defeated the New York Rangers in front of 17,132 at Mellon Arena in Pittsburgh, Saturday. The Rangers did manage, however, to pick up a precious point, as they managed to send the game into overtime.

The only goal of the first period was scored by the Rangers' Karel Rachunek, his 6th of the season at 19:14. The goal was assisted by Michael Nylander and Petr Prucha. Rangers goalie Henrik Lundqvist stopped all 7 shots faced in the first.

In the second period, Lundqvist continued where he had left off in the first, stopping another 7 shots, and blanking the Penguins for a second consecutive period. Just 1:11 into the period, Matt Cullen scored his 13th of the season to increase the Rangers' lead to 2-0. Cullen's goal was assisted by Jed Ortmeyer.

The third period over the past several games had been where the Penguins had amassed most of their offence. This game would prove no different, as rookie Evgeni Malkin scored a power play goal at 3:32, his team leading 31st of the season. Malkin was assisted by Ryan Whitney and Sergei Gonchar. Gonchar would pick up his second assist of the game less than 4:00 later, when on another Penguins power play, he and Malkin would set up Sidney Crosby for his record-setting goal to tie the game at 2-2. With the score locked up at the end of regulation, the game would go into overtime.

The Penguins, quite familiar with overtime, would end the game just 1:19 into overtime. With Sidney Crosby in the locker room due to an equipment problem, Colby Armstrong scored against Lundqvist to lift the Penguins to victory. It was not a total loss for the Rangers, however, as they managed to pick up a point in the contest. The Penguins don't play again until Tuesday night, when the Buffalo Sabres travel to Mellon Arena. The Rangers return to the ice tomorrow at home against the Carolina Hurricanes.
