Two men have made a private court appearance in relation to their charges of the murder of Liam Aitchison on the island of Lewis, in the Western Isles of Scotland. 21-year-old Jonathan MacKinnon, from Stornoway, and 20-year-old Stefan Miller, who lives in the Carloway district nearby, were both charged with the murder of the 16-year-old male at a brief court hearing in Inverness Sheriff Court yesterday.

The accused made no declarations or pleas at the private court hearing yesterday afternoon. They were subsequently remanded in custody. Examination of this case is to continue.

Aitchison's body was discovered in an abandoned building in Steinish, in the outer area of Stornoway, on November 22. Prior to the discovery, he had been missing for one week. The revelation of his death came across as "heartbreaking", according to Aitchison's family. His murder is the first to have occurred on the island for approximately forty years.
