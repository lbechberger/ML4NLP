On Sept 28, the Government of Alberta announced that the province's Athabasca University will get CA$30 million towards the creation of an Academic and Research Centre that will increase the University's campus by 50%. The announcement was made by Doug Horner, the Minister of Advanced Education &amp; Technology at a Press Conference at the University.

"It's all about more choices and accessibility to education," the Minister said.

The grant is being called by some as the University's second-biggest milestone after the move to the Town of Athabasca, and will allow for an additional 1,500 full time students per year. All of the University's courses are delivered by distance education.

"It allows us to serve our mission" said Joy Romero, the Chair of the Athabasca University Governing Council.
