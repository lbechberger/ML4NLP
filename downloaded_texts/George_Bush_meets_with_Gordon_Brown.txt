The President of the United States George W. Bush met today with his UK counterpart Gordon Brown, and addressed a press conference following the meeting in the Rose Garden of the White House.

President George W. Bush started the speech by saying that he appreciated the special relationship between the United Kingdom and the US. "we’re working very closely together," he said.

Bush continued by praising Mr. Brown for his reactions to the Glasgow Airport terrorist attack last year. The attack occurred just days after Mr. Brown became Prime Minister.

The speech continued when Bush thanked the British Army for their work in Iraq, which has been a subject of many newspaper headlines in the UK recently.

Bush then finished his part of the speech by commenting on Zimbabwe. "You can’t have elections unless you're willing to put the results out," he said, referring to the recent election. He also said that "more leaders in the region need to speak out" on the situation in Zimbabwe.

Brown then started speaking. He said that the bond between the UK and the US was getting stronger. He then said that both countries are making a 'strenuous effort' in the Middle East.
