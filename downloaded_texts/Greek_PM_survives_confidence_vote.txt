Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou survived a close confidence vote early Saturday morning. The vote was 153â€“145 for Papandreou.

Upon winning, Papandreou stated he may step aside if necessary. Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos stated a new government would be formed to last until the end of February. Venizelos has been proposed as a interim Prime Minister to succeed Papandreou. 

Opposition leader Antonis Samaras demanded immediate elections. He stated, "The masks have fallen. Mr. Papandreou has rejected our proposals in their entirety. The responsibility he bears is huge. The only solution is elections." The confidence motion came about after Papandreou proposed a referendum on the Greek bailout plan. After fierce opposition from other European leaders, the referendum was scrapped on Thursday.
