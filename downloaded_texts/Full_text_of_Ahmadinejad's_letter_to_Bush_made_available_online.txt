The French daily Le Monde, which has a tradition of publishing full texts by politicians and intellectuals, was one of the first organisations to publish the full English text of Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's letter to US president George W. Bush on May 9, 2006. On the same day, US daily The Wall Street Journal published a scan of the English text, and the Iranian Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) published the full text.
