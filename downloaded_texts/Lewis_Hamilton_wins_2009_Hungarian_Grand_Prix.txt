McLaren Mercedes driver Lewis Hamilton won the FIA Formula One 2009 ING Magyar Nagydij at the Hungaroring, just outside of Budapest, Hungary.

His KERS-equipped car was quick enough to overtake all the rivals in front of him, except only Fernando Alonso (Renault), who took the pole position yesterday. But Alonso's first pit-stop brought trouble with an untightly done wheel nut and he left the front right tyre spinning off the track, luckily no one was hurt as compared to Massa yesterday, and Surtees last Sunday.

Massa's teammate for Ferrari, Kimi Räikkönen, also managed to get through from seventh on the grid, to second place with the help of KERS. On the podium, his second place trophy was presented by prominent opera singer Placido Domingo.

Mark Webber set up a third place for Red Bull, while his team-mate Sebastian Vettel was out of the race due to problems with the car's suspension.

Nico Rosberg drove his Williams up to fourth place,
while the second McLaren of Heikki Kovalainen came fifth.

Championship leader Jenson Button gained two points for Brawn by finishing 7th and is now 18.5 points ahead of Webber, who has moved into second place ahead of Vettel. He split the two Toyota cars of Timo Glock and Jarno Trulli, who completed the top eight.
