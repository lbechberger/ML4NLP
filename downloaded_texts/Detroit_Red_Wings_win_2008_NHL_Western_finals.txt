North American ice hockey's major championship, the Stanley Cup playoffs, 
is down to a contest between the Pittsburgh Penguins and the Detroit Red Wings. Detroit defeated the Dallas Stars on Monday with a 4-1 score to win the Western Conference finals.

Despite a third-period goal by Dallas defenceman Stéphane Robidas, Detroit prevailed with three goals in the first period (Kris Draper, Pavel Datsyuk, Dallas Drake) and a goal by left winger Henrik Zetterberg in the second period.

Detroit captain Nicklas Lidström accepted the Clarence Campbell trophy on behalf of his team after the game concluded at the American Airlines Center in Dallas.

The first game of the Stanley Cup finals is scheduled for Saturday in Detroit at Joe Louis Arena.
