Wikinews held an exclusive e-mail interview with James Bruno, author of the political thrillers CHASM and Permanent Interests. 

Bruno, a former diplomat with the U.S. Department of State, military intelligence officer and journalist, retired early to take up writing. He says that because of his experiences, his books "possess an authenticity rarely matched in the political thriller genre."

When asked about what inspires him to write he replied, "During twenty-five years of working on national security in the federal government, I regularly faced situations which made me say, 'Fiction can't rival this.'"

Bruno holds M.A. degrees from the U.S. Naval War College and Columbia University as well as a B.A. from George Washington University.

His books are currently available on Amazon.com and Lulu.com.
