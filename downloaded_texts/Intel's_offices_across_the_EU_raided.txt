Local Law enforcement officials acting on behalf of the European Commission raided offices of Intel and several computer makers this morning, a spokesman for the EU said. He did not specify which countries or which other firms were involved. However, a spokesman for Intel Germany, Hans-JÃ¼rgen Werner, said that Intel's offices in Munich and Swindon were among those searched.

It emerged on Wednesday 13th, that raids also took place at Intel's facility in County Kildare, Ireland in relation to the firms anti-competitive business practices. Intel employs over 5,000 people at its Irish manufacturing facility.

The raids are most likely connected to an ongoing anti-trust investigation against Intel by the EU. It is alleged that the company used its market dominance to bully its clients into buying its chips instead of AMD ones. Intel is denying the allegations.
