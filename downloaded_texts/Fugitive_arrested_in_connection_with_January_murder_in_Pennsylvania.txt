A fugitive wanted in connection with a robbery that left a man dead in a Pennsylvania motel parking lot was arrested Friday after evading authorities for more than two months.

Myles Alexander White, 21, was arrested without incident in Long Island and is awaiting extradition to Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania, where he is accused of killing 22-year-old Blake Natal.

Natal, of Tobyhanna, was found dead on January 15 in the parking lot of a Quality Inn with his face and hands bloody.

Ralph Maldonado, 33, was already charged earlier this year with robbing and killing Natal with a sleeper hold after choosing someone at random to steal from. Maldonado, of Scranton, had previously said he committed the robbery with another man who had a handgun.


The Stroud Area Regional Police of Stroudsburg obtained an arrest warrant for White after receiving tips from confidential informants, combined with information from credit card and cell phone records. Upon learning White was in in Moriches, New York, the department sought help from Suffolk County authorities and the U.S. Marshals Service in arresting him. 

White faces charges of criminal homicide, conspiracy, robbery and other related counts.

Hours after the killing, Maldonado's mother, Sonia, and his girlfriend Venus Linian, used a credit card stolen from Natal. Linan, 28, and Sonia Maldonado, 50, have previously been charged with forgery, conspiracy, receiving stolen property and credit card fraud.
