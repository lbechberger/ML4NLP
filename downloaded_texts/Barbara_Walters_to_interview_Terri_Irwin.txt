Tuesday morning, ABC News correspondent, Barbara Walters announced on the television program, The View, that she is flying to Australia to talk with Terri Irwin, the widow of Steve Irwin. 

The exclusive interview will be televised next week.

Irwin died recently when stung by a stingray, the subject of a segment for a show he was producing with his young daughter as host.

Steve and Terri Irwin ran the Australia Zoo together, while Steve hosted many animal related series and specials, the most famous of which was titled Crocodile Hunter.

While she is only on The View full-time, Walters stated on that program that journalism for ABC News is still her "bread and butter".
