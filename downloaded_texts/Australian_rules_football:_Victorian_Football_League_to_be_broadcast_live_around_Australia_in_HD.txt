The Australian Broadcasting Corporation has announced plans to broadcast the Victorian Football League Grand Final, played on September 25, around Australia on its ABC HD channel. Victorian viewers will be able to watch a full replay on ABC1 from 10pm that night

“It will be the first time the VFL Grand Final has been telecast in high definition and footy fans are in for a visual feast,” Head of ABC TV Sports and Events, Justin Holdforth said.

“The VFL is the State’s oldest football competition and the VFL Grand Final, to be played under lights at Docklands Stadium, will be a magnificent prelude to the AFL Grand Final on Saturday afternoon.”

The Australian Football League forwarded a short statement to Wikinews stating that the broadcast would help the game further.

"We think its great news and great exposure for the state competition. AFL Victoria does a great job with the VFL and this will help the game further," the statement said.

AFL Victoria CEO Peter Schwab says the VFL has a reputation of being the best state based competition in Australia.

“Our State League has the reputation as being the best competition outside the AFL, now footy fans across Australia can see for themselves,” Mr Schwab said.

“I’m sure the delayed broadcast on ABC1 later that Friday night, and a highlights package of the VFL Grand Final the next day leading up to the AFL Grand Final, will also prove popular with footy fans.

“The ABC has been a great supporter of the VFL over the years and we certainly appreciate them broadcasting our game live during the peak rating period on Friday night.”
