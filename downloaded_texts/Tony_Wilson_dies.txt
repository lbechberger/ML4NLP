Anthony Wilson, journalist and record label owner, died of a heart attack on the 10th August, after receiving treatment for cancer.

He died at the Christie Hospital, aged 57 and is survived by his partner, Yvette Livesey. 

Wilson was receiving private medical treatment due to the recommended drug, Sunitinib, not being available through the publicly funded National Health Service. Wilson's treatment was being funded by former music industry friends.
