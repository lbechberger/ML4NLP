An overcrowded double decker bus in Guatemala crashed into a gulley Friday, killing 57 people and injuring 40 more, authorities say.

The bus crashed about 30 miles from Guatemala City while carrying roughly 100 people towards San Salvador.

Journalist Martin Austurias says that a makeshift morgue was created along the highway so that relatives of the passengers could identify the victims.

Austurias noted that several policemen and firefighters were working to uncover bodies from the wreckage.
