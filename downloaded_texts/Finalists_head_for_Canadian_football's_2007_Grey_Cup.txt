The Saskatchewan Roughriders will face off against the Winnipeg Blue Bombers at the 95th Grey Cup game in Toronto next Sunday, the 25th, as the Canadian Football League's 2007 season nears its completion.

The Roughriders defeated the BC Lions with a 26-17 score in the Western division final today at Vancouver. Saskatchewan last played in the Grey Cup finals 10 years ago.

Winnipeg won the Eastern division in Toronto after a 19-9 victory against the Toronto Argonauts.

The Grey Cup, first awarded in 1909, is Canada's most significant football trophy. This year's Grey Cup championship game features a scheduled performance by American rock musician Lenny Kravitz during the half-time intermission.
