The workers of Coca Cola in Colombia reiterated their accusations against Coca Cola for violations to the collective agreements after denying that the world wide campaign they are moving forward has political interests. Javier Correa, president of SINALTRAINAL, the National Union of the Food Industry, denounced that Coca Cola continues to violate the workerâ€™s right of association. He declared that of 8,700 employees only 2,300 have a direct contract with the company and that contractors and sub-contractors have no right to join the union organization. In addition, SINALTRAINAL denounced that there is a persecution campaign against its members that has resulted in attacks by paramilitary groups.
