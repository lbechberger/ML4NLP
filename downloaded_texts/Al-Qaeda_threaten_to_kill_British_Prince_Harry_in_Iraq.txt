According to a report from the British newspaper The Sun, Al-Qaeda members have issued a prominent threat on the Internet that Britain's Prince Harry will be killed or kidnapped when he is sent out to Iraq for his first tour of duty in the British Army in May this year.

An Islamic website has messages which have been posted on the site since the 22 year old Prince's deployment to the gulf state was revealed at the start of February. The messages included: "Prince Harry will be sent to Iraq to be killed by Muslims." and "May Allah give him what he deserves â€” like his fellow crusaders." Another person commented: "He must be wishing for his death."

Furthermore, The Sun reports that Harry and his troop of 12 soldiers will be trained this week to face hostage situations. He also has a group of SAS (Special Air Service) soldiers who will protect him.

The Prince has requested his regiment, the Blues and Royals, to treat him like any other soldier, whether royalty or not. Commenting on the threat, an official of the Blues and Royals said: "Officially Harry is being treated just like any other soldier but in reality everyone knows how desperate the insurgents out there will be to get their hands on him."
