German supermarket chain Metro Cash and Carry will open a new supermarket in Arad, western Romania. According to Arad's vice-mayor, Tiberiu Dekany, the building authorisation process is currently underway, with Metro already acquiring a building lot, with an area of 100,000 mÂ², on the outskirts of Arad, where the cash-and-carry store will be built. Metro is hoping to open the supermarket before the end of the year, and Dekany has said that the City Hall will give the building authorisations as soon as possible in order to let Metro meet that goal. Dekany did not comment on the value of the investment.

Metro is one of the largest supermarket chains in Romania, already having 21 stores in various cities across the country.
