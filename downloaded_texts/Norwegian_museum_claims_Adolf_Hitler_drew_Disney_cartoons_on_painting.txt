A war museum located in Norway has stated that Adolf Hitler has drawn characters from the Walt Disney film Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs and were found hidden inside a painting signed "A. Hitler".

Director William Hakvaag says that colored images of the characters Bashful and Doc along with the initials 'A.H.' appear hidden in a painting which tests say date back to 1940, sometime during World War II. Pinocchio is also reported to be among the characters drawn by Hitler. He says that he bought the painting for US$300 at an auction in Germany.

Long before he ruled Germany and his conquest of Europe, Adolf Hitler twice tried, unsuccessfully, to enroll at the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna in 1907 and 1908. He continued to work as an amateur artist until World War I.

"I am 100 percent sure that these are drawings by Hitler. If one wanted to make a forgery, one would never hide it in the back of a picture, where it might never be discovered," said Hakvaag. Hitler was reported to have owned a copy of the movie, made in 1937.

Hakvaag also says that the initials on the painting, match other historical documents containing authentic Hitler initials. 

So far there has not been any other confirmation of the museum's claims, but other alleged Hitler drawings that sold at auction have turned out to be forgeries.
