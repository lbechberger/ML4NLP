NBC News Washington bureau chief, senior vice president and the moderator of Meet the Press Tim Russert has died today after a sudden heart attack at NBCs Washington news bureau. He was rushed to Sibley Memorial Hospital in Washington, D.C., where resuscitation efforts failed.

Russert was recording voiceovers for Meet the Press when he collapsed. Russert and his family had recently returned from Italy after celebrating his son Luke's graduation from Boston College. He is survived by his wife Maureen Orth, son Luke, and father, who he knew fondly as "Big Russ", as illustrated in his best selling book, "Big Russ and Me."

A Buffalo, New York native, Russert graduated from John Carroll University and Cleveland-Marshall College of Law before entering politics. He was also a member of the bar in New York and Washington, D.C.
