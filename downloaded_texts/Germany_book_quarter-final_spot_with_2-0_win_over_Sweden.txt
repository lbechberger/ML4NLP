A two goal burst from Lukas Podolski in the first 12 minutes put Germany through to the quarter-finals of the Fifa World Cup, Saturday.



Sweden did not get into the round of sixteen game against the host nation and were not helped when Teddy Lucic was sent off before half time. Lucic had tugged Miroslav Klose's shirt to stop a dangerous run, and received his second yellow card on a controversial call.

Podolski scored the goals but the supremacy on the field was due to captain Michael Ballack who, with his passes from midfield, controlled the game for the Germans. Klose was influential next to young Podolski in attack, setting up both goals.

In the fourth minute, Klose turned and split two Swedish defenders just outside the box. His shot was blocked by Andreas Isaksson, but Podolski was there to put in the rebound. Soon thereafter, Klose occupied three Swedish defenders with a run across the penalty area, sent a reverse ball into the centre and Podolski converted for his second goal of the match.

JÃ¼rgen Klinsmann's side did not hesitate to shoot; they kept 63 per cent of possession and Ballack dominating many chances were created. Germany had 21 more shots than Sweden in the game. Isaksson made some outstanding one-handed saves to keep the score at 2-0, from Klose and a Ballack effort which he tipped onto his right post.

Lars Lagerback's side played with just ten men in the second half but they nearly got the perfect start with a penalty after Christoph Metzelder pushed Henrik Larsson from behind. This was the referee's second disputed call, after sending off Lucic. Larsson took the spot kick but the 35 year old Swedish star shot just over the crossbar. 

Argentina, the winner of match 50 versus Mexico, would meet the hosts in the quarter-finals of the World Cup.
