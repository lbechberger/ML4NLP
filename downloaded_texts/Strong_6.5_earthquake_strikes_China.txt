According to the United States Geological Survey (USGS), an earthquake with magnitude of 6.5 has struck China. Xinhua, one of China's main news agencies, reports the quake at a magnitude of 6.3.

According to the USGS, the quake was centered 55 kilometers (35 miles) East, Southeast of Da Qaidam, Qinghai province and was reported at a depth of 10km (6.2 miles). It struck at approximately 9:22 a.m local time on Monday morning. 

Although there have been no immediate reports of damage or injuries, the USGS says damage in the area could be "very heavy". The shaking was felt as far away as Golmud, and Xining, where witnesses say buildings shook, but there was no damage. This is adjacent to Tibet Autonomous Region and just at the foothills of Tibetan Plateau.

The Da Qaidam region is an area of China where there are several launch sites for DF-4 nuclear missiles. At least two nuclear missiles are reported to be stored in the Da Qaidam Basin and were deployed there in 1998. Da Qaidam is one of five locations throughout China where launch sites exist. There is no word if the sites suffered any damage from the quake.
