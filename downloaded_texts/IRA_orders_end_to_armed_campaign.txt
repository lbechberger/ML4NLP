The Provisional Irish Republican Army, in a statement released earlier today (in one form as a DVD, with the statement being read by SÃ©anna Breathnach), has declared that it intends to end its campaign of violence and decommission its weapons.

The move comes after international pressure to decommission weapons and cease all violent activity, particularly after allegations regarding the murder of Robert McCartney in Short Strand, Belfast, and a burglary of the Northern Bank in December of last year.

Members have been ordered to dump all arms and cease all paramilitary activity as of 16.00 BST (15.00 UTC) today, and the organisation's leadership states that it will pursue its aims through exclusively peaceful means. The statement reaffirms the IRA's view that its "armed struggle was entirely legitimate" as a means of pursuing the organisation's goal of a united Ireland, but states that many suffered during this conflict and that society is now compelled to build a lasting peace.

In its statement the IRA also appealed to the British government and Northern Irish Protestants to renew negotiations with them.
