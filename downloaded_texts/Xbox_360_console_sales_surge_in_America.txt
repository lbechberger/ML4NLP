The latest console data from the NPD Group shows that Microsoft's Xbox 360 console outsold Sony's PlayStation 3 by a ratio of 2 to 1. Earlier in August, Microsoft reduced the price of their console to try and compete with their other main competitor, Nintendo with their Wii console. However, the Nintendo platform is still selling strong with the Wii and the DS taking the top 2 spots once again.

Sales are also expected to increase for Microsoft in the month of September due to the release of Halo 3, the final game in the Halo trilogy. Michael Patcher, an analyst for Wedbush Morgan Securities, has predicted that the game will sell three million copies in the first 12 days of release.

The big surge in software sales lead to almost US$1 billion spent in the gaming industry in America for the month of August. Even with the software surge, 
all consoles had fewer sales than the previous month apart from Microsoft.
