The ATI Technologies Inc. (ATI) acquisition is being funded by a $2.5 billion loan, plus cash and cash equivalents and short-term investment balances of approximately $3.0 billion. Thatâ€™s total funding of $5.5 billion.


Many people believe Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) to be taking too much of a risk, that AMD is "betting the farm on a deal that might be very questionable."

The two firms announced they'll plan no job cutting in the process of merging.
