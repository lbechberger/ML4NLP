Three Islamic militants were arrested by German police in Oberschloedorn, Germany, a remote village located north of Frankfurt. The suspects who had been trained in Pakistan belong to the so-called Jihad-Union. They are also reported as having strong links to Al Qaeda. 

Two of the suspects were German citizens and one was a Turkish resident of Germany. They were found in possession of 1,500 pounds of hydrogen peroxide, which was the main chemical used in suicide bombings in London in July of 2005. One of the suspects was supposedly willing to commit a suicide attack.

“They were planning massive attacks,” the German federal prosecutor, Monika Harms, said at a news conference, outlining a vast six-month investigation. The targets of the attacks were thought to include places used by Americans, such as the Frankfurt international airport, and the U.S. Air Force Base at Ramstein. 

The plot was thought to have been planned to occur next week, 6 years after the September 11 tragedy.
