Today Sailors of HMCS York, Cadets of RCSCC 18 Vanguard, Navy League Cadets of NLCC Ark Royal and Air Cadets of 618 Queen City Squadron marched though Downtown Toronto with drums beating, colors flying, and rifles held proudly. All this was to mark the Battle of the Atlantic, which was a series of naval battles fought from 1939 to the end of the second world war. During the Battle, Canada lost about 2000 Sailors and 762 members of the Royal Canadian Air Force.

The Parade started out at Nathan Phillips Square, it then marched a short ways to the Cenotaph at Old City hall, where a ceremony was held for the dead and wounded in the Battle of the Atlantic. The parade then began again with a snappy left turn and marched along Queen Street West. It then wheeled north along Yonge St. to the Naval Club on Hayden Avenue. Seen in the photograph below is Lieutenant (Navy) Armstrong, the Executive Officer of RCSCC 18 Vanguard, in the background, are Vanguard cadets.

There where approximately 130 sailors, sea and air cadets in attendance.
