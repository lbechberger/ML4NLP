The centre of Roscrea, a small town in County Tipperary in Ireland was evacuated on August 23rd, 2006. The decision was made after Gardai (police) observed a man and a device believed to be dangerous in a house. Bomb disposal experts were on standby. The incident ended peacefully on August 24th, 2006 and the man, identified as Jim Hourigan, a separated father of three from Limerick, was taken into Garda custody.

Mr Hourigan released a statement through his solicitor, before he was placed in Gardai custody. It states he is frustrated by the delays in achieving justice for being sexually abused while training as a Christian Brother.

Roscrea town centre remains sealed off, as Garda technical experts examine Mr Hourigan's house.
