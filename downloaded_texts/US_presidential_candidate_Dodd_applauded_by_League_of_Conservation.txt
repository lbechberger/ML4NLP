The League of Conservation Voters (LCV) issued a statement today, congratulating Senator Christopher Dodd for his support of environmental issues. Dodd has made a large ad buy in Iowa and New Hampshire for a spot talking about his commitment to the issues. It is the first television ad by a candidate during the campaign to discuss global warming.

LCV President Gene Karpinski stated: 



On January 11, 2007, Dodd announced his Presidential candidacy on the now canceled Imus in the Morning radio show. The head of the New Hampshire Democratic party said Dodd told her that he wasn't "going to do the exploratory thing, I'm going to plunge right in."

LCV's mission is to "advocate for sound environmental policies and to elect pro-environmental candidates who will adopt and implement such policies."

Dodd is currently a senator for Connecticut.
