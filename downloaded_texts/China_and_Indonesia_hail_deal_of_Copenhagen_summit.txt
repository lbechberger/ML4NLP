China and Indonesia, two of the giants of Asia, have welcomed the UN Climate Change Conference outcome. 

The Chinese foreign minister and Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, the 6th President of Indonesia, appreciated the result of the UN Climate Change Conference. Obama defended the Copenhagen Accord and was the medium between the main new powers. The consensus didn't adopt the accord in the Copenhagen summit.

The 193-nation conference ended last Friday in Denmark. Richard Black, who is a journalist of BBC environment says the tipping point is the 2 degrees Celsius. The UN scientists says to avert the climate crisis we have to stay under 3.6F (2C).

Yang Jiechi, who is the 10th Foreign Minister of the People's Republic of China said: "Developing and developed countries are very different in their historical emissions responsibilities and current emissions levels, and in their basic national characteristics and development stages. [...] Therefore, they should shoulder different responsibilities and obligations in fighting climate."

Yang Jiechi thinks the summit was the beginning of a new chapter fight against of global warming. IPCC's leader, who shared a Nobel Peace Prize with Al Gore Rajendra Pachauri said "We will have to make sure it moves quickly".

The UN Climate Change Conference will be organized in Bonn, Germany. There will be other Climate and Atmosphere conferences in the future, for example the Fortaleza conference in Brazil, which start 16 August 2010. 

The Copenhagen Accord is based on a proposal tabled by US, China, India, Brazil and South Africa.
