News articles frequently discuss some issues but neglect others that might be more critical. Today the UN issued its third annual list to focus attention on a set of these relatively ignored stories. There is no particular order to the list, summarized here:

* Rebuilding Liberia: The nation used to be more stable and productive than its neighbors, but was destroyed by civil war.
* Restricting asylum: International asylum seekers recently suffer increasing difficulty as developed nations reduce economic migration.
* Rebuilding DR Congo: The 60 million inhabitants are trying to recover from the world's worst war in half a century.
* Children of Nepal: Children suffered during the 10-year civil war.
* Double trouble in Somalia: Lack of both government and rain are hitting people from two sides.
* Long-term refugees: Millions sit in camps for decades, as some conflicts remain unresolved.
* After the Pakistan earthquake: Quick relief efforts saved many survivors from disease or hunger.
* Imprisoned children: Children are often jailed for minor causes.
* Sharing water: Cooperating to use a valuable resource can improve both economic and political security.
* Inciting violence in CÃ´te d'Ivoire: Some media in the divided nation use hate speech, which induces group violence.
