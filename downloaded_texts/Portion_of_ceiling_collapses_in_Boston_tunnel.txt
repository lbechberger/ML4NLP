Massive concrete ceiling panels came crashing down in the I-90 Connector Tunnel of the Ted Williams Tunnel in Boston killing a 38-year old woman.

The woman, Milena M. Delvalle, 38, of Jamica Plain was traveling with her husband, Angel Delvalle, 46 to Logan Airport just after 11:00 pm. At least four 3-ton ceiling panels fell on their car, partially crushing it. Milena Delvalle died on the spot while her husband managed to crawl out of the car window, sustaining only minor injuries. 

The panels are designed to be held in position by metal rods and an epoxy "glue", which appear to have failed, causing the collapse. The investigation into the collapse is focusing on the epoxy, reports CBS 4. 

The tunnel, which was opened in 2003, is part of the Big Dig project. 

With the connector tunnel remaining closed, The collapse has caused substantial traffic delays.
