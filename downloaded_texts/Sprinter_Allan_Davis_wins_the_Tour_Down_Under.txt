Australia's Allan Davis won the 2009 Tour Down Under professional road cycling race.
Sprint specialist Davis completed Sunday's final stage in the main pack to maintain the lead he had built up in time bonuses from sprint wins earlier in the race.

122 cyclists completed the six day race around a circuit starting and ending at Adelaide, South Australia.

American cyclist Lance Armstrong also participated in the race, his first professional bike race since the 2005 Tour de France. It is not clear if the seven-time Tour de France winner intended to compete for the general classification, but he did make an unsuccessful breakaway on Sunday in pursuit of a stage victory. Despite several attacks over the week, Armstrong placed 29th in the general classification.
