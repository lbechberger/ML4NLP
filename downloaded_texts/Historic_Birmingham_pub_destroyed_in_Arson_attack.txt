The Dubliner, a famous Irish pub in the Digbeth area of Birmingham, has been destroyed by a fire that was started around 4.30am on the 26th July 2006, apparently deliberately.

Reports indicate between 100 and 120 firefighters were tackling the blaze at its height. There was also an explosion reported at the site.

12 people were staying overnight at the pub, all of them managed to escape the fire, although one man had to be treated for smoke inhalation.
