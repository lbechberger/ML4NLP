Romania's new road traffic laws have been approved by the Senate, with the laws being in accordance with European Union legislation and updating a previous law from 1999. Romania is currently going through the process of aligning its legislation with EU standards, as it is set to become a member of the European Union on January 1, 2007. The Senate approved the law with several amendments from the original draft drawn up by the government and approved by the Chamber of Deputies.

 

The new traffic laws include many important changes. Firstly, car drivers with a concentration of 0.80 grams or more of alcohol per litre of blood can receive penalties of between one to five years in jail. In the case of public transport drivers, the punishment can increase to seven years in jail. Additionally, constructions of any kind will be banned on sidewalks, and traders will not be allowed on roads and parking lots.

Another important change is that pedestrians injured while crossing the street in an unauthorised manner, such as at a red light, will "bear full responsibility" for their actions, according to the law.

Before being implemented, the law must be approved by the President, Traian BÄƒsescu.
