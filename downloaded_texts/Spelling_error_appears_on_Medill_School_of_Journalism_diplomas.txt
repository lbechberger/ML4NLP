On Saturday, Northwestern University's Medill School of Journalism in Chicago issued diplomas which misspelled the word integrated in "Medill School of Journalism, Media, Integrated Marketing Communications". Around 30 diplomas out of 250 distributed contained the spelling error, "itegrated".

In an e-mail quoted by Chicago Tribune, department lecturer Desiree Hanford said, "The diplomas are issued by the university, so we will work with the [university] registrar's office Monday to provide new diplomas to these students".

Inside Higher Ed said some alumni had objected to the program's name change several years ago, and found the current situation amusing given their opposition to including integrated in the program's name.

The journalism program has a grading policy called the "Medill F", where assignments that contain an error such as having a spelling error result in the assignment being failed. Graduating student Kit Fox, according to the Chicago Tribune, said of the Medill F, "When as a freshman you hear about it for the first time, it sounds extremely harsh. It sounds almost unfair...And then you look at the stakes of what journalism is, and you realize it's much more forgiving than what happens in the real world." He also told FOX 32 News, "Maybe it was just one last edit test for us grads, or just some fantastic irony".
