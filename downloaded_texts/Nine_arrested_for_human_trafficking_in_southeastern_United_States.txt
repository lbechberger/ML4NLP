Nine people were arrested on Thursday at cities in Florida, Alabama and Mississippi and have been charged as part of a 32-court federal indictment in an interstate human trafficking case. According to William Thornton from AL.com “the indictment was announced by Christopher P. Canova, Acting United States Attorney from the Northern District of Florida.” 

According to the indictment, between July 2015 and August of this year, the defendants transported, housed and marketed women for in Florida, Alabama, Louisiana and Mississippi. They took the proceeds and wired them out of the country. 

“Jose Juan Ruiz Prudencio, 40, and Emerson Corvera, 30, both of Montgomery, were arrested along with defendants in Florida, Mississippi and Georgia,” William Thornton reported. 

The nine arrested were also charged with three counts of enticing individuals to travel to engage in prostitution, seven counts of transporting people to engage in prostitution, four counts of money laundering, six counts of harbouring an alien for the purpose of prostitution and illegal entry by a deported alien. 

This case resulted from a 15-month investigation into human trafficking activities in the Northern District of Florida by Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Homeland Security Investigations (HIS) – Panama City Resident Agent in Charge. 

According to Kelsey Davis from Montgomery Advertiser, “The indictment also says at least 26 women were involved, who were sold for $30 per session. The price was later raised to $40 because the defendants allegedly stated they weren't making enough of a profit at the former price.”

According to the FBI Federal Bureau of Investigation, the defendants are:
*Edegardo Osorno Rodriguez, 37, Santa Rosa Beach, Florida;
*Antonio Flores-Esparza, 31, Pensacola, Florida;
*Jose Juan Ruiz Prudencio, 40, Montgomery, Alabama;
