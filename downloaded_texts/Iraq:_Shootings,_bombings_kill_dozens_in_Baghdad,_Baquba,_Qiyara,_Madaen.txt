As many as 47 people are reported dead and 113 wounded as bombs and shooting erupted across Iraq Sunday. Baghdad and Baquba, particularly, each sustained multiple blasts. 

The United Nations says violence in Iraq July killed over 1,000 people, more than in any other month since 2008. Sunni militants are reportedly gaining strength in Iraq.

Amongst the incidents: A car bomb near a Baquba housing complex killed 11 and wounded 34, according to police. Military sources said five soldiers were killed at a fake checkpoint near Qiyara, north of Baghdad, and their bodies were burned. In Madaen, two separate bombings reportedly killed seven and injured 30. Two explosions also rocked the capital, Baghdad, killing an additional twelve people and wounding 45, according to officials. A car bomb in Balad killed at least four and wounded several more, including a judge who was driving past.

No group has claimed responsibility for the incidents.
