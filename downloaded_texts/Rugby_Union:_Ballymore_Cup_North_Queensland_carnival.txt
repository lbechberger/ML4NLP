Rockhampton Grammar School, Townsville Grammar School and St. Augustine's College (Cairns) played the North Queensland Carnival as part of the Ballymore Cup quarter finals this past weekend. Rockhampton Grammar School won the final and will play Siena Catholic College in the semi final.

The Ballymore Cup is a state wide Rugby Union competition in the Australian state of Queensland. Schools participating in the Greater Public Schools (GPS) competition do not compete in the Ballymore Cup.

Mackay representative Whitsundays Anglican School did not participate as they could not field a suitable team.
