Reports say that the Tipperary Peace Convention located in Ireland will be giving its 2007 Peace Prize to former Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto.

"Benazir fought all her battles through dialogue and was an example to all those who do not use or surrender to terrorism. Her selection as Peace Prize recipient should act as an inspiration to those in Pakistan who seek to secure democracy and reconciliation for their country. She was an incredibly brave and courageous woman who had returned from exile to her homeland to lead her party in the forthcoming elections," said the organization in a statement to the press.

Bhutto was assassinated during a rally for democracy on December 27. She was shot by a suicide attacker in the neck and chest, who then blew himself up killing 21 others.

The organization was founded in 1984. Its goal is to "give recognition to those who promote the ideals of peace and peaceful co-operation both in Ireland and abroad," says their website. The award will be presented in her honor in April of 2008 during the organization's International Festival of Peace in Tipperary Town.

Past recipients of the prize include former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani who received his honors in 2001, former United States President Bill Clinton received the award in 2000 and Nelson Mandela in 1989.
