The Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) has investigated Milan and their goalkeeper Dida over the incident with the Celtic fan that led to his substitution against Celtic. A fan ran on to the field immediately after Celtic striker Scott McDonald scored the eventual winning goal and appeared to have slightly touched Dida. Dida ran after the fan for a few steps before falling to the ground. UEFA have already investigated Celtic for lack of security for the same incident.

The charges were based on Article 5 Paragraph 1 of UEFA's disciplinary regulations, which states that "member associations, clubs, as well as their players, officials and members, shall conduct themselves according to the principles of loyalty, integrity and sportsmanship". 

The case were heard on October 11 by UEFA's Control and Disciplinary Body. The outcome of these cases were as follows: Celtic FC were fined Â£25000, 50% of which is kept in a reserve tank and if Celtic have any further problems in two years UEFA will keep it, but if they don't they will get it back. A.C Milan goalkeeper Nelson de Jesus Silva "Dida" was banned for two games but is appealing. If found guilty he could find himself with a four-game champions league ban.
