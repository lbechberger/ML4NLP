Former Spanish PM Jose Maria Aznar has described the NATO alliance as a zombie organization that needs to reform or is going to die. He said that in order to fight the “dark forces” of islamic terrorism NATO needs to take in like-minded nations such as Australia, Israel and Japan and create a strategic association with regional powers such as India and Colombia.
