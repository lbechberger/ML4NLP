Aid from the United Nations has started to reach Myanmar after a recent cyclone in the region killed tens of thousands. 

The UN Secretary General, Ban Ki-moon released a statement regarding the delivery of aid to Myanmar:


Government officials in Myanmar have said that 22,464 people have been confirmed dead from Cyclone Nargis.
Only once rescue workers reached the hardest hit areas of the storm did they begin to realize the extent of damage that had occurred. At least 10,000 people died in one town alone, Bogalay in the Pyapon District of the country.

The United Nations has reported that one million people are homeless, or in need of help in some other way.
