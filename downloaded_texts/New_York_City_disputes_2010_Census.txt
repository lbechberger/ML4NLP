New York City officials plan to dispute the Census Bureau's data, after it was discovered that the 2010 Census reported only minimal growth in New York City and in the boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens. 

On Sunday, NYC mayor Michael Bloomberg stated "[t]hat can't be possible," and announced that the city would formally challenge the bureau's findings. NY Senators Kirsten Gillibrand and Charles Schumer also expressed interest in the alleged error.

"These are high growth areas w/large immigrant populations. It's crucial that #NYC get the federal funds &amp; the representation it deserves." said Sen. Gillibrand on her Twitter page. Sen. Schumer, a resident from Brooklyn, also complained, "The Census Bureau has never known how to count urban populations and needs to go back to the drawing board," he said in a statement. "It strains credulity to believe that New York City has grown by only 167,000 people over the last decade. To claim that growth over the last decade in Brooklyn was 1.6% and growth in Queens was 0.1% flies in the face of reality."

In order for the city to challenge the count, city officials will contact Commerce Secretary Gary Locke, and will undergo a process known as the Count Question Resolution Program.
