On Monday, the Indonesian President, Joko Widodo flew back to Indonesia after a trip to the United States to deal with the burning across the country which are posing a significant threat to the orangutan population. 

El Niño effect was the main reason of the forest fires which brought warmer temperatures and drought to the region and the method of clearing land for the production of palm oil. Haze from the fires covered the southeast Asian countries causing health issues to the living beings. 

The estimated population of the orangutans in Borneo islands is about 40,000 and 10,000 on the Sumatra islands. Their native habitat has been under threat for some time due to the clearing of land for palm oil production but the fires are now placing them under greater threat. The fires and the dense smoke are causing the orangutans to suffer from undernourishment, respiratory diseases and burns. The forest fires are also forcing the orangutans closer to human settlement which places them in danger of being killed or sold.

Indonesia, along with Malaysia, produces 85 percent of the world’s palm oil and fires are frequently used as part of the slash and burn method to clear land for palm oil production. The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) suggested that global demand for palm oil is expected to double by 2020.
