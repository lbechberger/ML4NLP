Yesterday on Novastream, Sloncek announced officially that the Suprnova index for BitTorrent, a program used to download music, video, and program files, and responsible for approximately one third of all transfers over the internet, will have a successor. Suprnova was voluntarily shut down earlier in the year due to threats made by the MPAA regarding copyright violation.

The program to take the place of Suprnova, "Exeem", is a blending of 'the tracker', the BitTorrent client, and its 'decentralized indexing'. As the program is in a state of testing, its current form is only designed to run on Windows. Although currently undergoing a Beta Test, the program will be released some time in the near future. The program also contains a rating and commenting system that, although basic and primitive, seems to be comparable to that of Suprnova in its quality.

There are also unconfirmed rumours that Sloncek is receiving payment from a third party for participating in the Exeem team's efforts. This raises the question: is Exeem actually related with Suprnova and, in turn, can it be said to be its successor?
