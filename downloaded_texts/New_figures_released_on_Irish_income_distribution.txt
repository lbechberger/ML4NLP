New figures released yesterday by the Central Statistics Office of Ireland confirmed that Dublin has the highest level of disposable income per person in the Republic of Ireland whilst Cavan, Donegal and Kerry have the lowest figures.

Taking 100% to be the national average, Dublin's disposable income per person was 13.4% above the national average, compared to the bottom three counties which were up to 16.5% below the national average.

According to the figures, only four counties in the country were above the average - Dublin, Kildare, Wicklow and Limerick. Six counties were less than 90% of the national average.

The figures indicate that Southern and Eastern regions have the highest levels of disposable income in the country. The Western, Border, Midland and Northern regions have the lowest levels.

The figures - althought the latest available - were put together in 2002. It is likely the situation has changed somewhat since then.
