A celebrity sex tape starring former American Idol finalist Jessica Sierra has been leaked to an internet pornography company, who is reportedly planning to release it.

Sierra made her fame as a finalist on the 2005 season of American Idol, in which she was the third finalist eliminated. The new tape is reported to show her in a number of nude poses in a hotel room. The footage will be released later this month.

Sierra is already suffering from negative press as she appeared in court on Sunday. She had been arrested after being kicked out the Full Moon Saloon in Ybor City early the previous morning, after which she is said to have attacked first a friend, then passing onlookers. Local officials claim that after being arrested, she offered to perform oral sex with the police officers who arrested her if they would release her.

The site TMZ.com say they have received several stills from the video, and have posted one on their website. They also say the tape's release will coincide with the start of the next series of American Idol.
