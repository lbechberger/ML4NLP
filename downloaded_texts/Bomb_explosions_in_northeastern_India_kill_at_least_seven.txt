Two bomb explosions in the northeastern Assam state of India have killed at least seven people and injured 25 more today.

The blasts, which happened within several minutes of each other, occurred outside of a police station in the town of Nalbari, 70 kilometres from the state capital of Guwahati. According to security officials, the explosives were attached to bicycles.

Police believe that the separatist rebels from the United Liberation Front of Assam (ULFA) were behind the bombings, but a senior ULFA member denied that the group carried out the attacks. Nobody has yet claimed responsibility.

There were reports of another explosion nearby soon after the first to explosions; however, they have not been officially confirmed.
