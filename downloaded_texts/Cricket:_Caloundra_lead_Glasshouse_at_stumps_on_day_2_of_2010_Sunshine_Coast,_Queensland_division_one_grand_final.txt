Caloundra were all out in their first inning for 193. In reply, Glasshouse could only manage 100.

“I thought it (bowling) was terrific. I thought 250 was a par score and I thought we were in with a big chance,” Milini said. "If we were good enough, we should have got that pretty easy but we didn’t bat well today."

Caloundra rounded out day two at six out for fifty seven, leaving Glasshouse an outside chance of snatching the championship.

“We’ve given ourselves another chance but if we bat like we did in the first innings, we’re already gone,” he said. “It should be a real good game, it’s interesting cricket.”
