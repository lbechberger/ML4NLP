Shinzo Abe took 66% of the vote in today's Liberal Democratic Party election for a leader to replace Junichiro Koizumi, whose term as party chief expired. The party, with a solid majority in the House of Representatives, is expected to elect Abe to be the next Prime Minister. Abe is a third-generation politician related to two former Prime Ministers. The election comes on the day before his 52nd birthday. He is expected to become the nation's first Prime Minister born after World War II.

"The LDP has helped make Japan a democracy that has contributed to the world," Abe said after the vote. "I will demonstrate my leadership to preserve the flame of ideals, and put reforms forward as the first party leader from the postwar generation."
