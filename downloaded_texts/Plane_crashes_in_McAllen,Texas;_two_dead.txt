Two people are dead after a plane crashed at a intersection in McAllen shortly after 7:00 p.m. local time (CDT) on May 2. 

A man who video taped the scene stated on a TV interview, "The plane just missed my truck... total strangers just started jumping in to help the pilot... people were yelling 'Bring a fire extinguisher'... It was amazing that the pilot still asked to save his girlfriend even though his own life was in danger." 

They succeeded in dragging the pilot, 35-year old Jose Francisco Vasquez, out of the burning wreckage; however, his girlfriend, 24 year Gina Asuara, was burned to death. Vasquez suffered 3rd degree burns to 90% of his body. He later died at the Brook Army Medical Center at around 7:30 a.m. (CDT) on May 3

Friends say Vasquez was an experienced pilot. He owned several planes and flew at least twice every week. He was in the Mexican Air Force during his earlier years and was on vacation at Houston, Texas.

Officials said the accident was likely due to a engine failure during take off. The plane crashed near a intersection on 10th St. and Dicker Road about 2 minutes away from the Dodge Arena. The road was closed due to investigations; however it was reopened on May 3 at 8:30 p.m. (CDT)
