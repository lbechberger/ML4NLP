Two days of heavy rain caused severe floods in Sri Lanka, an island in the Indian Ocean, off of southeast of India. Among central, western, and northern regions of Sri Lanka, more than 50,000 families have been displaced and six people have died. The western, some parts of southern and north-eastern provinces were among the worst hit areas. 

These floods were an additional bitter blow to the victims of last yearâ€™s tsunami who are living in temporary shelters; specially in the north-eastern province. The rebel-held Kilinochchi, Mullaitivu and some eastern parts areas are still waiting for their share of the tsunami aid. The newly elected president has torn apart the agreement signed by the former president and the Tamil tiger rebels will have to share the aid between the two. Their current weather is expected to improve.
