Today will mark Australian Prime Minister John Howard's 10th anniversary holding what is arguably the most powerful office in Australia. John Howard is Australia's second longest serving Prime Minister, behind Sir Robert Menzies.

Howard celebrated his decade in office last night at a gala dinner at Australian Parliament House in Canberra. Around 700 conservative supporters and business figures were present at the dinner.

Mr Howard gave a speech to his delegates, saying he was grateful to Australians for their support and promised to try not to abuse their trust. 

"I am deeply conscious of the trust that you have put in us and I am deeply grateful... for the privilege that has come our way," Mr Howard said. 

"We have tried not to abuse it and we will try in the future never to abuse it, because public life is the ultimate in terms of serving a nation and serving a community,â€� he said. 

Peter Costello, Mr Howard's most likely successor gave a brief speech to the delegation saying "It's not just a wonderful 10th anniversary for the coalition government."

"There is another 10th anniversary that we ought to acknowledge tonight - it's the 10th anniversary of Labor in opposition," he said.

Despite many political commentators believing that Howard (now aged 66) will soon retire and hand the reins over to Peter Costello, Mr Howard told ABC radio, "I will remain in the position as long as my party wants me to."

Mr Howard also showed his support for his likely successor saying "If I were to go under a bus, the person who would and should become the leader of the Liberal party is Peter Costello. I am very careful crossing roads."
