A bomb exploded Tuesday night in Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka. The bomb may have targeted a high-profile individual, traveling through the high-security zone in the Colombo Fort area.

Earlier in the day, a government minister was killed by a roadside bomb. This blast has been blamed on the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) by government officials.

The deputy director of the government teaching hospital in the town of Ragama, Lalini Gurusinghe, announced the death of the minister. The explosion took place in Ja-Ela, a town some 12 miles north of Colombo.
