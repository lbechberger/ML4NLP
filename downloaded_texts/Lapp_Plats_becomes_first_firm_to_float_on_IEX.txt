A little-known mining company, Lapp Plats, has become the first company to list on Ireland's newly created Irish Enterprise Exchange (IEX). The firm has also applied to be listed on London's flourishing Alternative Investment Market (AIM).

Lapp Plats' admission to the exchange brings to nine the total number of firms listed on the IEX - the other eight were all previously listed on the Exploration Securities Market, which was the precursor to the IEX.

At present Lapp Plats is involved in platinum and nickel exploration; but intends to broaden its interests into to other areas such as minerals, other metals, oil and gas.
