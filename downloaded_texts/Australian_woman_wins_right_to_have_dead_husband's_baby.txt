An Australian woman has won the right to be impregnated with sperm from her husband, who died seven years ago. The sperm was taken from the man shortly after his death in a car accident, and frozen. The Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal ruled that the woman should be permitted to take the sperm to New South Wales. Posthumous conception is illegal in Victoria, where the sperm is currently stored.
