Beth Twitty, missing U.S. teenager Natalee Holloway's mother, is preparing a civil lawsuit against Joran van der Sloot, major suspect in the teenager's death. On her behalf, Dutch lawyer Bram Moszkowicz is investigating whether Van der Sloot can be charged with unlawful action. 

Twitty's civil claim follows the CuraÃ§ao's court decision that Joran van der Sloot will not be arrested again. The investigation to what happened with Natalee Holloway, and Van der Sloot's role in that matter will be continued, but the secret tapes presented by crime reporter Peter R. de Vries are not sufficient for a new arrest.

Moszkowicz claims that there are two reasons for starting a civil procedure: first there is the shock after Van der Sloot's confessions, and second his keeping silent on the details. Twitty compares this case to that against O.J. Simpson, who was never convicted in a criminal case, but was convicted to pay damages in civil court.

The chances that Van der Sloot will be convicted in a criminal case are getting smaller. "I think the criminal investigation comes to an end," says Moszkowicz, "That does not mean that I understand, or agree with that".
