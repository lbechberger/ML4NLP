In recent days, reports have surfaced that Microsoft may plan to backport its WinFS system to Windows XP.

The technology, intended to track file metadata for better organization and searching capability, had previously only been planned as part of the forthcoming Microsoft Windows Longhorn operating system release.

Support for Windows XP, while surprising, may aid developers in speeding adoption of the new technology in their applications.
