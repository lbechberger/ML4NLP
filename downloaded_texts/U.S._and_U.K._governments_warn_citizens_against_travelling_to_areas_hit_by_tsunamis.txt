The U.S. State Department issued public travel warnings, advising United States citizens to avoid travelling to areas affected by the recent Indian Ocean earthquake and the resulting tsunamis. The announcements cover Indonesia, Sri Lanka, the Maldives and affected areas of Thailand. The warnings are set to expire on January 25, 2005, and urge citizens to postpone all non-essential travel to the regions.

The U.K. Foreign and Commonwealth Office also carries Travel Advice notices covering many of the countries hit by the tsunamis, and similarly urges citizens not to travel to the areas unless absolutely necessary.
