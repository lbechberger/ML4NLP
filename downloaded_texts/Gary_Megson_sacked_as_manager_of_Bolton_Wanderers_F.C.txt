Football manager Gary Megson has been sacked as manager of Bolton Wanderers Football Club. Megson, who joined the club in Oct. 2007 was relieved of all managerial duties effective immediately, according to a statement released by the club. His dismissal comes after fans called for him to be sacked after a 2-2 draw to Hull City F.C. Bolton are currently 18th in the Barclays Premier League and are in a high chance of relegation. Megson has previously saved the side from relegation twice. 

Before managing Bolton, Megson had previously managed West Bromwich Albion and Nottingham Forest F.C. Fans reacted angrily at the appointment of Megson in 2007. He is the third Premier League manger to lose his job this season. Manchester City F.C manager Mark Hughes and Portsmouthâ€™s Paul Hart were both sacked due to poor results. 

Bolton Wanderers have released a statement through their website saying that "[a]ssistant Manager Chris Evans and first-team coach Steve Wigley will take charge of first team matters for the interim period".
