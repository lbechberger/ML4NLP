The Sector 15A locality in Noida, India, which is considered an elite enclave of rich industrialists, bureaucrats and professionals was in for a shock when Anant Gupta, son of Adobe India CEO Naresh Gupta was abducted in broad daylight by two unidentified men on Monday. 

The Noida police was subsequently notified but they were unable to locate the motor-cycle used by the kidnappers as no one was able to take down the registration number of the vehicle. A number of raiding teams have been formed by the police to track down the offenders.

Naresh Gupta, who was in the United States at the time of the incident has implored the media to stop covering this issue so as to avoid sensationalising and prevent any harm to his son.

The kidnapping sent shockwaves throughout the cities of Noida and New Delhi. Some say this is an indicator of the rising crime rate in a city like Noida which was previously considered relatively safe and peaceful.
