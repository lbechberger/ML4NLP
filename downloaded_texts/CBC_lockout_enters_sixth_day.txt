The labour dispute between the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and its union the Canadian Media Guild continues, with no sign that the sides will return to contract negotiations. The CBC has locked out about 5500 of its union employees, which include broadcasters and technicians. The main disagreement is over the proportion of permanent workers CBC hires.

CBC management wants to increase the number of employees hired under a fixed-term contract basis, as opposed to permanent staff, saying it will give them more flexibility. The Canadian Media Guild calls CBC management's contract offer "little more than a veiled attempt to buy off employees with their own money".
