Journalists are no longer allowed to go any higher than base camp on Mount Everest when visiting the Nepalese side of the mountain, which is the world's highest. This comes after new regulations from the Government of Nepal restricted access to the mountain for all journalists.

"We knew there were restrictions on video cameras and satellite phones but we're now told even pre-recorded radio material on non-political subjects would not be allowed," said BBC reporter Charles Haviland on the incident. This move comes after an American was forced off the mountain after being discovered with a Tibetan flag. These are not permitted on the Tibetan side of the mountain. A Nepali official aimed to justify the new restriction. "We are doing this for our friend China," he said. 

The Chinese government has already imposed similar restrictions on the Tibetan side in the mountain

Mount Everest is located in the Himalayas mountain range. It is 8,848 metres (29,029 feet) high, making it the highest mountain in the world, although not the tallest. Mauna Kea is considered the tallest mountain since it begins well below sea-level.
