Romania have qualified for the 2007 Rugby World Cup in France, finishing at the top of their pool during the Round 5 of the European qualifying tournaments. Romania won their first qualifying match on October 7, defeating Georgia in Bucharest 20-8. Their 43-20 win over Spain in Madrid on October 14 ensured that they qualified directly for the World Cup next year.

Romania qualified as Europe 2, joining Pool C where they will face the All Blacks, Scotland and Italy, as well as one other nation yet to qualify (Repechage 1). Romania have thus far competed at every Rugby World Cup, since the first one was held in 1987. Romania's best result is one win during the pool stages, which it has achieved at every World Cup thus far.

One of the other two nations in Round 5 can still qualify for France next year, and Georgia and Spain will meet each other in Tblisi on October 28 which will determine who finishes second in the pool and advances to Round 6. There they will face the winner from the other pool from Round 5 for the Europe 3 qualification path. The loser of Round 6 can then still qualify through repechage. Both nations have been to the World Cup previously, Spain in 1999 and Georgia in 2003.
