U.S. forces accidentally fired upon on a civilian vehicle north of Baghdad on Monday, killing at least one child and 2 other people, a military spokesperson has said. 

The incident occurred when an American soldier spotted the vehicle moving in an erratic fashion outside a base in Baqouba. American soliders fired warning shots before shooting at the vehicle, according to U.S. military spokesman Maj. Steven Warren.

Dr. Ahmed Fouad, a doctor at the city morgue, later claimed that the death toll was higher, and three children were killed. Military sources claim that the extra casualties may in fact have come from a car bomb targeting American soldiers in the same area at the same time, which killed five civilians and wounded twelve others.
