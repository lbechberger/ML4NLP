Yesterday, police in Vancouver, Canada released images showing suspects in a possible hate crime that left a man "very traumatized by the event, very afraid," according to Constable Tim Fanning.

On May 2, a gay man in Vancouver's West End was shouted at, pelted with eggs and had a beer bottle thrown at him, although the bottle did not hit him. The 37-year-old victim was walking in downtown Vancouver, east on Davie Street, an area with most of the city's gay clubs and bars.

"The type of attack ... and the fact that the victim here is openly gay lends itself for investigators to believe it's that most repulsive of crimes, possibly a hate crime," Fanning commented.

The images released by the police department were captured by surveillance cameras at a Mac's convenience store close to the attack. They depict three males, estimated to be between 18 and 20 years old, purchasing eggs just prior to the incident. People are being urged to come forward with any information about the identity of the suspects.
