The United States Senate has voted to accept President George W. Bush's nomination of Condoleezza Rice as United States Secretary of State. Eighty-five Senators voted to approve her accession while 13 opposed it. Two Senators did not vote.

Democratic Senators had criticised her during debates on the nomination, but this did not prevent her gaining the second-highest ever number of votes for a nominee for Secretary of State.

The former head of National Security replaces Colin Powell, who became the highest-serving African American in U.S. history when he became Secretary of State in 2000.

Ms Rice is expected to be sworn into office in the White House later this evening, with a more elaborate public ceremony on Friday, and to begin her new role on Thursday morning.
