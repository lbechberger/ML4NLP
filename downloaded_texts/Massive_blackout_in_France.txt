On the night of November 3rd a blackout in France left 5 million in the dark. The blackout, which started at about 10 P.M. local time (2100UTC), is said to have affected the French capital, Paris, and 15 other areas, including Rhône, Isère, Loire, Ain and Saône-et-Loire (Burgundy).

As of early Sunday morning, about 5 million people are still without power, and the French power authority, Électricité de France, said that the failure had originated in Germany, which has also effected other European countries.

The blackout was triggered due to a sudden drop in temperature, which over heated the power system. The French emergency services were so overloaded with calls that they were forced to ask that people not call.

Air traffic around Paris was unaffected by the blackout.
