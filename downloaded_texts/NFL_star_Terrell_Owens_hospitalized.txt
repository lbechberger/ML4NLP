Instead of returning to practise from a fractured finger today as scheduled, flamboyant Dallas Cowboys receiver Terrell Owens is instead recovering at Baylor Medical Center this morning from an apparent suicide attempt last night. A female friend who was with Owens last night observed him taking several prescription pain killers and behaving erratically. She called 911 and Owens was rushed to the hospital.

Original reports stated that Owens was suffering from an adverse reaction to the pain medication, which he was taking for a fractured hand. But this morning, Dallas police have reported that Owens took an unknown large amount of the pills, and when asked by police this morning if he had been attempting to hurt himself, Owens replied, "Yes." 

Paramedics have only confirmed that they called police to report that they were bringing Owens to hospital.

Owens has since said that he was not attempting suicide.
