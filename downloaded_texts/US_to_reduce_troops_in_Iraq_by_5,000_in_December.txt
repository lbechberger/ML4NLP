According to the United States military in Iraq, at least 5,000 U.S. soldiers are going to be withdrawn from the country.

The 3rd Brigade, 1st Cavalry Division of the U.S. Army are stationed in Iraq's Diyala Province. When they finish their withdrawal in December, they will not be replaced by another division.

The military indicated the withdrawal is possible due to improved security in the country. If security improves further, as many as 20,000 troops could be on their way back to the U.S. by July 2008.

"The redeployment without replacement reflects overall improved security within Iraq. If conditions continue to permit, a total of five brigade combat teams will be redeployed over the next eight months," said U.S. military in Iraq spokesman, Rear Admiral Gregory Smith.

Smith also mentioned that four more army brigades and two marine battalions would leave Iraq before July 2008, restoring pre-surge levels of 130,000 troops. There are nearly 163,000 U.S. troops serving currently in Iraq.
