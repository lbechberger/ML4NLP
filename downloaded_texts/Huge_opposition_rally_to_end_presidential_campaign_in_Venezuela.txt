To mark the end of the presidential campaign in Venezuela, opposition candidate Manuel Rosales held a rally with up to 1.4 million people attending according to one source. Manuel Rosales is the opposition candidate to Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez who is running for his 2nd six-year term. 

The rally, which in Venezuela they call "Avalancha" because of its size, was held on the highway that runs through Caracas, the capital of Venezuela. The Presidential elections will be held December 3rd and Manuel Rosales has a much better shot of winning than most would have anticipated earlier in the year. Observers from Organization of American States, the European Union, and the Carter Center will be present to ensure that the elections are fair and make sure the people's vote is secured. 

Large public demonstrations are banned by the government for December 3rd and 4th to ensure the elections "go smoothly."
