At least four people have been killed in a militant attack on a Pakistani military base in Karachi. Explosions and gunfire were heard inside the base during the latest militant attack since U.S. forces killed Osama bin Laden in a raid on his compound in the country earlier this month.

Officials said as many as twenty militants may have attacked PNS Mehran in Karachi, the largest city in the country, and confirmed four had been injured and five wounded. Reports indicate Pakistani forces at the base are fighting back against the attackers; one military aircraft has been destroyed.

There are likely to be questions over how militants were able to infiltrate the base, even after warnings from the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan that there will be reprisal attacks for the killing of Osama bin Laden, the leader of al-Qaeda, in Pakistan this month. A spokesperson for the militant group said they would launch attacks on Pakistani military forces to avenge the terrorist leader.
