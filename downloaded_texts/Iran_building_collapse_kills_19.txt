A building in Iran's capital Tehran collapsed today and killed at least 19 people. The fate of a twentieth person is unknown.

The victims were all labourers living inside the building, which is reported to have been in a seriously unstable condition for a month, with occupants refusing to comply with evacuation requests. The early morning disaster in the Sa'adatabad district reduced the building to rubble in seconds.

The seven story building was described by The Canadian Press as 'dilapidated'.

Five people have been arrested, including the owner and contractors. Iranian state media promised that those responsible would be dealt with severely.
