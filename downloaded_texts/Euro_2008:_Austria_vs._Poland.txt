Austria salvaged a draw from their group game against Poland after referee Howard Webb awarded a controversial penalty in injury time, which Vastić duefully converted, becoming the European Championships' oldest ever scorer, at the age of 39. 

Austria had several clear chances early in the match, Harnik failed to score when put through one-on-one with the outrushing Polish goalkeeper Boruc in the 11th minute. Guerreiro scored in the 30th minute for Poland, despite suspicions that he tapped in Saganowski's cross from an off-side position. Austria pushed for an equaliser in the second half but were held steadfastly by the Polish defence, including some stunning saves from Artur Boruc. In the third minute of injury time referee Howard Webb awarded a penalty to Austria after sighting shirt holding in the penalty-area, which Vastić scored in a dramatic finale.

Austria will face Germany in a must-win match on Match Day 10 (June 16, 2008), and will be without Sebastian Proedl, who will be suspended, having collected 2 yellow cards in both his appearances so far. Poland will face Croatia, and also must win to qualify for the Quarter-Finals.
