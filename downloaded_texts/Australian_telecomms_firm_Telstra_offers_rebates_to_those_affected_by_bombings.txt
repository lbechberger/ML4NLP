Australian telecommunications giant Telstra has announced that it will be offering a rebate to those customers who placed calls to the United Kingdom to check on relatives in the wake of the recent bombings. Of the approximately 700 people wounded in the attacks, only 7 were Australians, however there are many more Aussies spread throughout England and Europe at any time.

To be eligible for the rebate, the calls must have been made between 6pm AEST Thursday the 7th through to 6am Saturday the 8th, according to Telstra chief Sol Trujillo. As well as this, Telstra customers who have a relative who has been hospitalized as a result of the event will be eligible for a rebate for a period of one month from July 7.

Applying for the rebate involves Telstra customers calling a special number which will appear on their next bill. Telstra has been working with the Australian Federal Government to provide further assistance to customers.
