A day after Libyan government forces captured the town of Brega in eastern Libya, rebels claim they have retaken control of the area.

Only hours after rebel forces were reported to have left the town, they issued claims that they again controlled Brega, having killed or captured several government troops. A group of special forces reportedly were responsible for capturing the town during Sunday night.

According to a rebel leader, "[t]he exact information that we have today ... is that the revolutionaries have taken back Brega and then they captured more than 70 soldiers belonging to Gadhafi troops."

As the violence continues, calls for a no-fly zone over Libya are increasing. The Arab League voted on Saturday for a no-fly zone, while France has said it will increase its efforts to persuade the international community put one in place.
