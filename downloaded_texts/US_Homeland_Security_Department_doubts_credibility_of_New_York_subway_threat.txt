The US news agency CNN is reporting that the recent New York subway terrorist threat this past weekend was based on "false information." The original tip lead to the arrest of three men in Iraq with suspected ties to the plot; however, under interrogation which included lie detector tests, investigators discovered they had no knowledge of any planned terror attacks on the New York subway system.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) was skeptical of the threat since it was first announced last week. More recently, Russ Knocke, a spokesman for the DHS, said "The intelligence community has been able to determine that there are very serious doubts about the credibility of this specific threat."

Responding to the new comments from the DHS, New York City Mayor Bloomberg replied, "We've got to take every threat seriously and that is what we are going to do." Even before the new questions about the tip's accuracy, Mayor Bloomberg was already defending his decision to increase security and promised that the measures will remain in place for at least the near future. Mayor Bloomberg explained that, while he did not believe he made a mistake in calling for increased security, "If I'm going to make a mistake you can rest assured it is on the side of being cautious." New York City Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly agreed, adding, "We did exactly the right thing." Critics of Bloomberg have charged that the threat was a bid to "look strong" in support for his upcoming re-election attempt.
