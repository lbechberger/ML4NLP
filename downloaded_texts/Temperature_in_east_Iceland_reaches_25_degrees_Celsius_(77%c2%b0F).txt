This summer has brought a large amount of sunlight to Iceland. Temperatures have been soaring upwards in the eastern and north eastern regions of Iceland over the last few days, with the temperature reaching as much as 25 degrees Celsius (77° Fahrenheit) in Miðjarðarnesi. 

At Egilstaðir, near to Landsvirkjun's Kárahnjúkavirkjun dam construction site it's been around 24°C (75°F).

The Icelandic Weather Agency is predicting continuing hot weather in east Iceland. The sun could even start shining in Reykjavík, the capital city of Iceland, later this week.

Much of western Europe has been experiencing particularly hot weather this week with much of Ireland enjoying temperatures between 24°C and 26°C (75-79°F) since Saturday afternoon.
