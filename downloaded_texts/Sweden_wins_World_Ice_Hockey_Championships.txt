The Swedish national ice hockey team won the 2006 Ice Hockey World Championships Monday in Riga, Latvia, defeating the Czech Republic by a score of 4-0 to become the first country to win both the Winter Olympics and the Ice Hockey World Championships in the same year.

Jesper Mattsson (14:36), Fredrik Emvall (15:13), Niklas Kronwall (24:07), and Jorgen Jonsson (37:01) contributed the four goals that led to the Swedish team's win. Coach Bengt-Ake Gustafsson was reported as stating that "It's fun to be part of hockey history. It's been great working with these guys and my staff. I think we played more or less a perfect game today."

Kronwall, a Detroit Red Wings defenseman, was named the MVP of the tournament.
