Early indications are that between 5,000 and 6,000 litres of fuel leaked from a storage tank into a stream leading to Welcome Bay, which is near Wollaston Lake in the northeast part of the province.

The RCMP is still investigating cause of the spill. "We're trying to determine the circumstances around the leak, whether it was an intentional act or whether it was due to a problem with the tank," RCMP spokesperson Sgt. Brian Jones said.
