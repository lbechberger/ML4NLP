A 23-year-old Tokoroa man has been arrested for the murder of a school teacher, Lois Dear. Dear's body was found on July 16 (Sunday) in her classroom at Strathmore Primary School, one day before term three of the New Zealand primary school year was to start.

The accused murderer, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was arrested on Monday night at a camp and appeared in court today.

A large crowd of media personnel and onlookers gathered outside the packed courtroom. Twenty to thirty people had to remain outside. Many of the people who had gathered outside the courtroom abused the accused man as he walked to the courtroom. One said "You'll never make sentencing." Armed police also were deployed to protect the alleged murderer.

One person, who did not want to be named, said she "had come to let people know who had been arrested." She shouted the name out as the accused walked by.

The accused was remanded and is to appear back in court next week.

Murray Kendrick, principal of Strathmore Primary School, said that he "knew an arrest was imminent, and is relieved it has happened so quickly."

Police are not ruling out anyone else taking part in the murder.
