On Friday, Judge Robert Simpson Jr. threw out a petition challenge brought by Jane Faust against Patrick Murphy, a candidate for the 8th Congressional District in Pennsylvania. Josh Nanberg, Murphy's campaign manager, stated, "We won."

The case centered on objections to Murphy's nominating papers. The judge threw the case out due to a part of the law which requires that any objections must be raised at least seven days prior to the court case to allow the defendant time to collect evidence. The objections in this case were brought the day of the trial.

Jen Paski, a spokeswoman for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee said, â€œWe were very distressed by this challenge and we are absolutely thrilled that it failed."

The lawyer who filed the challenge on behalf of Faust has stated that he will continue the case, and will attempt to bring it to the state Supreme Court, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court.
