After four years, the suspended Northern Ireland Assembly has taken over the direct governing of the part of the United Kingdom that since Ireland's independence in 1922 has been controversially disputed.

The Assembly, which was established as part of 1998's Good Friday Agreement, was suspended in 2002 over allegations of Republican spying. During that time the entire province was ruled directly from London. Four years ago, few could have expected that Democratic Unionist Party leader Ian Paisley, the preacher known for the longest time in Northern Ireland politics as "Dr. No" and Sinn Féin deputy leader Martin McGuinness, who at one time was an IRA commander, would be sharing power together. However, with the addition of the Saint Andrews Agreement to which both Sinn Féin and the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) agreed, this became a reality.

Ian Paisley will take his post as First Minister of Northern Ireland and Martin McGuinness will serve as his deputy. The DUP receives four cabinet ministers which includes the deputy leader of the party, Peter Robinson, becoming the head of the Department of Finance and Personnel. Sinn Féin gets three. Meanwhile, the other, less-powerful unionist party, the Ulster Unionist Party receives two which includes UUP leader, Sir Reg Empey heading up the Department for Employment and Learning. Northern Ireland's other mainstream nationalist party, the Social Democratic and Labour Party will head the Department for Social Development.
