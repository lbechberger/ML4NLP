Tropical Storm Isaac is creating a swathe of concerns across many gulf states in the US, as it sweeps into the Florida Keys.

As of 5:00pm EDT, Miami area winds were measuring at 60 miles per hour. Authorities indicated 5,180 homes across Broward county are without electricity. According to media sources, the governor of Louisiana anticipates giving evacuation orders as early as Monday morning.

Hurricane warnings have been issued in the Florida Panhandle, sweeping as far west as Louisiana. Sunday afternoon, Louisiana's Governor Jindal issued a state of emergency for the state. Over 450 flights at Miami International Airport were canceled this weekend, in light of the storm's arrival.

Ultimately, the storm's winds could reach as high as 110 mph, according to sources. The mayor of New Orleans told media that many residents there are nervous. The last time a hurricane struck the Gulf coast was in 2008.
