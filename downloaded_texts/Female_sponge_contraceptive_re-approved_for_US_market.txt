What was once the most widely sold contraceptive for millions of women, the TodayÂ® Sponge, has been re-approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to be brought back for sale to the American marketplace, as early as this summer.

The reintroduction of the sponge, demanded by many women for years, is noteworthy because it offers certain distinct advantages versus other forms of contraceptive:
* It does not interfere with the natural sensations of intercourse, compared with male or female condoms.
* It does not require multiple applications of contraceptive gel or cream, unlike the diaphragm.
* It remains effective at preventing pregnancies for up to 24 hours after insertion, even with several acts of sexual intercourse.
* It will legally be made available over-the-counter an estimated price of $7.49 to $8.99 for a package of 3.

The sponge does not, however, protect against sexually transmitted diseases, and it carries with it certain minor risks which should be noted by potential users.
* There is a minor risk of Toxic Shock Syndrome, a risk also carried by certain other female hygiene products, such as tampons.
* Product should not be inserted during menstruation, and should be removed after no more than 30 hours of continuous use.

The sponge has also been found less effective as a form of birth control than oral contraceptives, Depo-Provera injections or an intrauterine device (IUD), although similar in effectiveness to the male condom. A pregnancy rate of 13 to 16% is expected from a year of "typical use" as a standalone method of birth control. The product varies in effectiveness depending on if the woman forgets to insert the device before intercourse, uses the device incorrectly, or fails to wait at least 6 hours after intercourse before removing the device.
