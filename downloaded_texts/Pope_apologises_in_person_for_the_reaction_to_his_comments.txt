The Pope after delivering Angelus Blessing on Sunday has issued a personal statement regarding his remarks last week in Bavaria that angered the Islamic community. He quotes "I am deeply sorry for the reactions in some countries to a few passages of my address at the University of Regensburg, which were considered offensive to the sensibility of Muslims." Senior imams in India have supported the Pope's apology and calls for an end to violent protests. The Pope also clarifies the statement quoting "These in fact were a quotation from a medieval text, which do not in any way express my personal thought." 

The full apology statement can be read from the BBC's website.
