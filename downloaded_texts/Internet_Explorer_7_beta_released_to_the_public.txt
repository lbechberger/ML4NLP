The screen shot above shows several renderings of the Acid 2 CSS test, used to identify web page rendering flaws in web browsers and HTML authoring tools:
*Green — Optimal (Konqueror)
*Yellow — Firefox 1.5
*Red — Internet Explorer 7


The long awaited Internet Explorer 7.0 beta preview was released to the public on January 31. 

Large amounts of the architecture, including the security framework, have been completely overhauled. Partly as a result of these security enhancements, the browser will be a stand-alone application, rather than integrated with the Windows shell. 

The final Beta 2 is scheduled by Microsoft to be released in April, with the full version scheduled for the Summer of 2006.

According to Microsoft's announcement, the beta will only run on Windows XP Service Pack 2 systems, but the final release version is intended to be able to run on Windows Vista, Windows XP Professional x64 Edition, and Windows Server 2003 as well.
