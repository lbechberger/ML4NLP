American singer, Brandy Norwood, known for her role as a judge on America's Got Talent amongst other roles, has been sued for US$50 million by the family of a woman who was killed in a car crash.

California Highway Patrol (CHP) said that Brandy, 27, should be charged with a misdemeanor count of vehicular manslaughter for being part of the fatal car crash that killed Awatef Aboudihaj, 38.

Aboudihaj's family lawsuit accuses Noorwood, known as Brandy, of "reckless driving".

Brandy, in a Land Rover SUV on December 30, 2006, bumped into the Toyota which had Awatef Aboudihaj in it. The Toyota slammed into another vehicle and slid on the freeway's center divider. Aboudihaj was sent to Providence Holy Cross Medical Centre but died the next evening.

"The accident was a terrible tragedy, and Brandy's heart goes out to Awatef Aboudihaj's family," spokeswoman, Kelly Mullens, said in a statement. "But for legal reasons we cannot comment on this lawsuit."

If Brandy is charged, she could face one year in jail and a $1,000 fine.
