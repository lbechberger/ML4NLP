Yesterday, the United Nations Security Council said it would take all steps necessary, including the implementation of individual sanctions, in order to ensure that the resolutions of the Security Council were adhered to by both sides of the troubled Ivoiran peace process. The remarks followed a briefing to the Security Council by representatives from the UN Mission in Cote d'Ivoire and African Union-appointed South African mediators.

"The South African Mediation stated that it will continue its efforts, with the support of the United Nations and the African Union, to ensure the holding of free, fair and transparent elections in CÃ´te d'Ivoire as scheduled, which is the only solution to the crisis," the Security Council said in a statement following the meeting. 

The next round of elections are scheduled for the end of October although it is widely believed this date is unlikely to be met.

The peace process in Cote d'Ivoire has been on shaky ground following the failure of the rebel forces to begin the disarmament process originally scheduled for 31 July. The rebels, led by the Forces Nouvelles, claimed that Ivorian President Gbagbo had failed to make the necessary legal reforms necessary to begin the disarmament. The international community later ratified the legal changes made by the Ivorian government as being in compliance with the peace deal.
