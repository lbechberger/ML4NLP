Nikolay Davydenko, from Russia beat Rafael Nadal in the Sony Ericsson Open, which takes place in Florida.

Davyenko commented on his performance after the match. He said that his "tennis was so good today. I think it's the best tennis of the hard-court season." He continued, "Here Nadal was favourite, and also in semi-final Roddick was the favorite. Just to beat two guys in two sets is like amazing for me." 

Nadal also commented on his performance. "I think he [Davydenko] played at a good level. He played a good match, but I didn't play well today." He continued, "So when you don't play at 100% at this level against top players, it's tough to win, especially on a hard surface. So I congratulate him more because he played better than me."
