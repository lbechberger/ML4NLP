The death toll in a collision between two helicopters in Arizona, United States has been finalised at seven after the only survivor died. James Taylor was an emergency nurse present on one of the helicopters, which were both Bell 407s performing patient transfers to nearby Flagstaff Medical Center. The other six, including two patients, died at the scene.

Taylor, 36, worked at Salt Lake's St. Mark's Hospital, and also part-time with Life Flight, who operated the helicopter he was on board at the time. He had only recently started working at St. Mark's after 17 years at the Intermountain Medical Center, and was also a veteran of Desert Storm as a member of the Utah Army Reserve.

His sister said of him "He loved serving others ... and especially being paged for lifeflight duty. He gave his life trying to save another ... he truly was a hero." As well as an extended family mostly residing in Utah Taylor is survived by his wife and three young sons.

Zion's Bank have established the James Taylor Memorial Fund to help the family he left behind.
