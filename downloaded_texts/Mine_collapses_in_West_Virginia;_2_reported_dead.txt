At least 2 coal miners in Cucumber, West Virginia were killed inside an underground mine after the roof collapsed when a pillar fell over. The collapse happened approximately 1.5 miles away from the entrance to the mine and it is not known what caused the pillar to fall.

"There's no need for rescue teams, the individuals have been recovered," said Office of Miners' Health, Safety and Training director, Ron Wooten.

The mine is called the Brooks Run Mine and owned by Alpha Natural Resources LLC. The mine is located in McDowell County, in the southern part of the state.

A call to 911 was placed at approximately 11:00 a.m. [EST].

Officials say that an investigation is being conducted.
