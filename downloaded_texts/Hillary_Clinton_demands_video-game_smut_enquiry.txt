Hillary Clinton has joined the controversy over a mod for Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas called "Hot Coffee" which disables the game's built-in censorship mode, allowing players to participate in graphic sex mini-games within the game.

The ESRB have continued to state that they are not intending to take any action against Take2 Interactive (the game's producers). 

Patricia Vance, the president of the ESRB, said that the author of the modification "actually had to change the underlying code [of the game]. It's not a cheat, It's not an Easter egg... Game developers have been known to deactivate parts of their code without removing them from the finished products. Oftentimes, changes are toward the end of development, and they program workarounds."
