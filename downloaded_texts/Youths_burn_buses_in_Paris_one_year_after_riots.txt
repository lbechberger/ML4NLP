Youths attacked &amp; burned three buses in western Paris suburbs.

A gang of about 30 youths stopped each bus with a road block, forced passengers off, doused the bus with petrol and set it ablaze, destroying the bus and causing damage to cars parked nearby. When firefighters arrived, the youths threw stones at them.

No injuries were reported in the Paris attacks, but one woman was seriously burned in a related attack in Marseilles. There has been one arrest for the Paris attacks.

The attacks mark the one year anniversary of the 2005 French riots, when cars and public buildings were set on fire, mostly by young North African Muslims immigrants.
