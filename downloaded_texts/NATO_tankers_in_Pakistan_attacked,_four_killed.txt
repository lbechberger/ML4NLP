Several NATO oil tankers were set on fire in the Punjab province of Pakistan, and four policemen were killed in a gunfight with unknown gunmen yesterday, reports say. The Deutsche Presse-Agentur (DPA) news service attributes the attack to the Taleban.

The incidents occurred in the town of Talagang. Aslam Tareen, the regional police chief, said that "around a dozen" tankers were set on fire after being attacked with rocket-propelled grenades. "Later on, they exchanged intensive fire with the police and killed four of our officers while two more were injured," Tareen said, adding that a petrol station nearby the oil tankers also caught fire.

DPA says the attack was the deadliest on NATO supply convoys in the province. Close to three quarters of all oil, food, and military supplies to landlocked Afghanistan first pass through Pakistan.
