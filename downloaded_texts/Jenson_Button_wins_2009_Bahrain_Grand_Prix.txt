Brawn-Mercedes driver Jenson Button won the FIA Formula One 2009 Bahrain Grand Prix at Bahrain International Circuit, Sakhir, Bahrain. This is his third win this season.

The previous GP winner Sebastian Vettel came in second for Red Bull.

Though Toyota drivers grabbed the front row in Saturday's qualifying, they could not compete for long with their lightly fueled cars and slipped to the pits earlier than competitors. This cost two places for Jarno Trulli and even more for his teammate Timo Glock, who ended up at 7th position.

The defending champion Lewis Hamilton missed out what would have been the first podium for McLaren this season, crossing the finishing line some 12 seconds behind Trulli. Button's teammate Rubens Barrichello stayed close behind Hamilton, finishing fifth.

Timo Glock was beaten by KERS-equipped Ferrari of Kimi Räikkönen who brought first points for the team coming in 6th.

Fernando Alonso closed the top eight for Renault.
