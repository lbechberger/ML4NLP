Donald Rumsfeld revealed today that he will not resign his position as United States secretary of Defense. Several other members of President George W. Bush's cabinet have resigned. Rumsfeld stated he will continue at his post until at least the end of the Iraq war, although he did not commit to remaining for the full four years of the administration. While also not committing to any dates for withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq, Rumsfeld indicated his desire that they be withdrawn sometime within the next four years.
