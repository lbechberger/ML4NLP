The Minnesota Twins lit a fire in front of a sold-out Metrodome crowd during Monday's season opener against the Baltimore Orioles. The fans came to cheer on the 2006 American League Central Division champions and remember veteran radio broadcaster Herb Carneal who passed away a day ago.

Orioles starter Erik Bedard pitched five innings, giving up ten hits and six runs, including back-to-back home runs in the second inning to reigning American League MVP Justin Morneau and outfielder Torii Hunter. Twins starter Johan Santana give up seven hits and four runs in six innings, including a home run to Miguel Tejada in the fifth inning. Twins closer Joe Nathan picked up his first save of 2007.

The Twins players sported black armbands to honor Carneal, and a tribute was shown prior to the game to honor the legendary broadcaster. Between innings, people spoke about their memories of Carneal. This is the first time since 1978 that the Baltimore Orioles have started their season away from home.
