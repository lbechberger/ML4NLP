He left at around 5:00 a.m., with two women from Belgrade, when he was attacked by nationalist Serbs. He was not seriously injured and was released from the hospital shortly after his arrival. The police are still looking for several young male suspects. During his performance there were a few smaller incidents where several people fought with police.
