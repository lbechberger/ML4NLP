In March this year, participants of Disney Shake Party received a mail saying that were accepted when they were not accepted ,the domain of the email points to the Ajifilms producer responsible for the falsification of identity.

According to one of the affected persons Felipe Ignacio Godoy Fulle, he was asked to remove a photo from facebook of the casting a photograph published in Twtter and re published by another account in Facebook , but Jose Tomas Godoy Edding said that the casting is real.

No podemos dar la versión de Ajifilms por que no responde los correos desde Julio y jamas le dijo a los participantes Felipe Ignacio Godoy Fulle, José Tomas Edding Y Tomas Salbach si fueron aceptados.
