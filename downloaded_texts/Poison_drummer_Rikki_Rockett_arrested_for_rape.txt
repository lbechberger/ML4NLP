Rikki Rockett, drummer for United States glam metal band Poison, was temporarily arrested today on an outstanding rape warrant after exiting a plane arriving at Los Angeles International Airport (LAX), California from New Zealand.

The arrest stems from an alleged incident on September 23, 2007, while Rockett — real name Richard Ream — was staying at the Silver Star Hotel &amp; Casino in Mississippi. A female guest alleges Rockett raped her in his hotel room. Several days after the attack is claimed to have occurred, she filed a report with the Neshoba County Sheriff's department. They determined there were sufficient grounds to arrest him and issued a warrant.

Los Angeles Police Department arrested him on his arrival at LAX and booked him into Los Angeles County Jail but the 46-year-old was released because Mississippi authorities decided not to extradite him while official charges from the Neshoba County District Attorney are pending.

Rockett had been in New Zealand to play at Wellington's Rock2Wgtn festival with the rest of Poison, who opened day two and were joined by Whitesnake and Ozzy Osbourne. The previous day featured Lordi, Alice Cooper and KISS.
