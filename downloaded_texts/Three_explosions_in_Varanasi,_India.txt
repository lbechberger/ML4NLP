At least 15 people are feared dead and at least 60 others are wounded after three explosions in the Hindu pilgrimage town of Varanasi, India. 

At approximately 1230 UTC/0730 EST, the first explosion occurred outside the crowded Sankat Mochan temple. The second took place just minutes later at the Cantonment Railway Station, leaving a crater just outside the stationmaster's room, and the third occurred on the Shiv Ganga Express, which had been leaving for New Delhi.

Officials say that the area has been cordoned off and the injured have been shifted to a hospital on the Benaras Hindu University campus. They also report that at least four unexploded bombs were found near a holy site by the Ganges River.

According to media advisor Sanjay Baru, Prime Minister Manmohan "has appealed for peace and calm. He is constantly monitoring the situation."
