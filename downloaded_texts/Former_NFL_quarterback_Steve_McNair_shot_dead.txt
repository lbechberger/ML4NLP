Steve McNair, former National Football League (NFL) quarterback was found shot to death in an apartment in Nashville, Tennessee, in the United States, around 1:00 PM on July 4, 2009. Sahel Kazemi, a 20-year-old woman, was also found dead with a gunshot wound in the same apartment. A gun, presumably the murder weapon, was found next to Ms. Kazemi's body. The Tennessean newspaper is calling the death "an apparent murder-suicide."

McNair played 13 seasons in the NFL, 11 with the Houston Oilers/Tennessee Titans franchise, and two with the Baltimore Ravens. Titan's owner "Bud" Adams said of McNair: "We are saddened and shocked to hear the news of Steve McNair's passing today. He was one of the finest players to play for our organization and one of the most beloved players by our fans."

Kazemi was an employee of the Dave &amp; Buster's restaurant in Opry Mills, Tennessee, and had been dating McNair for several months, according to The Tennessean. McNair was still married to another woman at the time of his death. Two days prior to their deaths, Kazemi had been arrested for driving under the influence in a black 2007 Cadillac Escalade which had been a gift to her from McNair. He was in the car at the time of the arrest; he was not charged with any crime and later bailed her out of jail.

The bodies were discovered around 1:00 PM on July 4, 2009 by Wayne Neely, a friend of McNair. Another friend, Robert Gaddy, called police to report the deaths at 1:35 PM. 

Nashville police are still investigating the deaths, and have not ruled out any scenarios. However, they also state that they are not actively pursuing any suspects at this time. They are awaiting an autopsy report on the two deceased before forming any conclusions about the situation.
