United States presidential candidate Barack Obama's lead in the polls has increased by 3.3% over John McCain since the Democratic National Convention. Last week, the two candidates were statistically tied. Now, Barack Obama is polling at 49.0% and John McCain is polling at 44.1%, a 4.9% lead, according to the latest Day to Day Politics Poll Average. The margin of error for the poll average is at 0.93%. 

This is the largest lead Barack Obama has had in the past two months. The last time time it was this high was July 27, 2008 when it was 4.8%. For the past 6 days, the Gallup Poll and the Rasmussen three day tracking polls have held steady for Barack Obama at 49%. 

McCain has recently added Alaskan Governor Sarah Palin to his nomination ticket. A poll shows that among white women, McCain has a slight advantage, 46% to 42%. When the public is asked about the selection of Sarah Palin, 52% rate the selection as excellent or good. On whether she is qualified for the White House if she needed to fulfill the role of presidency, only 45% say she is qualified, whereas 50% say she is unqualified. 

The Day to Day Politics Poll Average for the past week used the Gallup Tracking poll, the Rasmussen Tracking poll, and the CNN poll.
