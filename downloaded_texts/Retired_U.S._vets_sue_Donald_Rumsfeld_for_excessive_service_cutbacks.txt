One thousand residents of the Defense Department-managed Armed Forces Retirement Home in Washington, D.C. filed a class-action lawsuit on May 24, asserting that the cut-backs in medical and dental services imposed by Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld are illegal. The operating budget for the home was reduced from $63 million in 2004 to $58 million for 2005. The residents cite cuts in on-site X-ray, electrocardiogram, physical and dental services, and the closing of the home's main clinic and an on-site pharmacy. 

Chief Financial Officer Steve McManus responded that the changes not only save money but also achieved improved efficiencies. "We're really trying to improve the benefits to our residents," he said. 

Most of the home's costs are paid for by a trust fund and monthly fees paid by residents. By law, the Armed Forces Retirement Homes are required to fund, "on-site primary care, medical care and a continuum of long-term care services."
