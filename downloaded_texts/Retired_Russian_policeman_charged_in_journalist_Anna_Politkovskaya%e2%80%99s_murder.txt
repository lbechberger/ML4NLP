Dmitry Pavlyuchenkov, a retired Russian Police officer, has been charged for organising the 2006 murder of journalist Anna Politkovskaya by the Investigative Committee of Russia. Pavlyuchenkov is accused of ordering the surveillance of Politkovskaya, supplying the murder weapon and passing on information about her daily routine. 

Investigators said Pavlyuchenkov was paid to plan Politkovskaya's death in July 2006. The Other Russia reports Pavlyuchenkov has admitted to helping organise Politkovskaya’s murder but not as the main organiser. This confession will shorten his prison sentence.

Investigators said they believe Lom-Ali Gaitukayev was the main organiser of the murder. Gaitukayev is currently in prison for attempted murder on charges unrelated to the Politkovskaya case. Investigators have not said whether Gaitukayev will be charged in connection with Politkovskaya's death and his lawyer has declined comment. Investigators also have not said who may have hired Gaitukayev.

According to The Other Russia, Pavlyuchenkov has named Rustam Makhmudov, Gaitukayev’s nephew, as Politkovskaya’s murderer.
