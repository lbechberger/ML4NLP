Early turnout for the two by-elections in Ireland today was between 20% and 30%.

The two elections in the Meath and Kildare North constituencies are taking place to elect two new TD's to the Dail after the two former representatives; John Bruton and Charlie McCreevy, took up posts in the EU.

A large number of votes was expected in the last hour of voting, as commuters returned home from Dublin. Polling started at 9am and ended at 10pm. 

The votes will be counted beginning at 9am in Naas and Navan.
