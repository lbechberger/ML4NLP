Japan's coastguard reported Sunday that an underwater volcano had erupted in the eastern Pacific Ocean, about 1400 kilometers south of Tokyo. A plume of steam, rising more than 1100 meters into the air, was spotted by Japanese troops on Iwo Jima. Iwo Jima is located about 48 kilometers from the eruption.
 
Airborne Japanese officials and coastguard aircraft crews reported the water appeared brick-red. The survey crew also reported a grey, mud-like substance rising from the bottom. Video footage was taken. 
 
The last undersea eruption in the area was in 1986 and lasted three days.
