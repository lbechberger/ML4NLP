"Jerry" Brown won his fourth term to the governorship said the Associated Press (AP), beating his Republican opponent Neel Kashkari with, according to unofficial results, 58.7 percent of the vote as of 4:43 a.m. local time (0928 UTC). Lieutenant Governor Gavin Newsom also won a second term.

The Republican Party nominated Kashkari over Assemblyman Tim Donnelly, however, Kashkari lagged behind Brown in the polls by double digits. Kashkari was expected to lose to Brown in this election.

Politico reported Brown was popular among California voters with a 54 percent approval rating and remained in the lead over Kashkari in the pre-election polls.

Also on yesterday's ballot was Proposition 47 which would reduce several felonies to misdemeanor status, reducing maximum sentences from three years to one. AP reported Proposition 47 as having passed. As of 1:28 a.m., unofficial results said the proposition had 58.4 percent "yes" votes.

Brown's father Edmund G. "Pat" Brown was governor for two terms before losing the governorship to later United States President Ronald Reagan. Jerry Brown had previously won the gubernatorial election in 1974, serving two terms from 1975 until 1983, and served a third term after winning in 2010.
