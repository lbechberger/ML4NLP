Nearing the end of his second term as President of Russia, Vladimir Putin delivered his eighth annual state-of-the-nation address to the Federal Assembly of Russia today.

Putin said foreign cash is being used to meddle with domestic affairs, criticised the United States plans to install an anti-missile shield in Eastern Europe, while arguing to declare a moratorium on the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe. He also discussed economic issues and internal affairs, and made it clear that next year's address would be given by another President.

Putin began his 72-minute long state-of-nation address by requesting one minute of silence for Boris Yeltsin, who died at age 76 last Monday of a heart condition. He suggested that a national library be established in the name of the deceased president. Putin's speech had originally been scheduled for Wednesday, but it was postponed one day because of the funeral for Putin's predecessor. Putin followed Yeltsin as Acting President when the latter unexpectedly resigned on December 31, 1999. Putin was then elected May 7, 2000.
