The Producer Price Index is a US government report on prices as seen from the producer of goods. This shows prices before effects such as government subsidies, sales and excise taxes, and distribution costs. The index is used as a leading indicator of consumer inflation in the future as changes in price will eventually flow down to the consumer. 

The index can be found at the US Department of Labor web site.
