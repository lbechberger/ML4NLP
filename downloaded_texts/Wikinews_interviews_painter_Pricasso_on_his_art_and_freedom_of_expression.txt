  Verified account ‪ @jimmy_wales You know, the ‪@Wikipedia and ‪@Wikia guy. Free speech activist, entrepreneur."

 Are you familiar with the U.S. Supreme Court case, Hustler Magazine v. Falwell ? How do you feel after reading about the unanimous decision protecting parody as a form of freedom of speech in that case?

Pricasso: Thanks for sharing that with me, I had no idea about this case and it's good to know that freedom of speech is alive and well in America. Actually I was a bit taken aback by the parody and slightly offended that I have been put in the same category, my painting is pure performance art and I don't go out of my way to offend. And I am totally against censorship. It's a shame the same is not true about Wikipedia and Mr. Wales.

 Pricasso, thanks again for doing this interview with Wikinews, is there anything else you'd like to add?

Pricasso: Not at the moment. I'm exhausted! Thanks.
