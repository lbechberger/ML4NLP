  How old are you?
::Gerald Huang: I'm 13 years old. 
  Ahh... Still a very young age.
::Gerald Huang: Yes.
  How do you find the matches against other countries?
::Gerald Huang: It's a bit challenging at first to get settled in. You might have to defend the first few deliveries before actually scoring some runs.
  Rumour has it that you had a very bad injury in 2009. Is this true?
::Gerald Huang: Yes.
  What happened?
::Gerald Huang: Well, the opposing team slapped the ball at the end of the bat, which is the most powerful place to hit the ball, and it hit my bone, which made it hurt. 
  You were able to get back up and play?
::Gerald Huang: Not for 3 months
  All of your classmates say that you are a very professional player, playing the opening batsman.
::Gerald Huang: Well, I wouldn't really call myself as a "professional player", but I'll take it.
  Thank you for your time!
::Gerald Huang: No problem.
