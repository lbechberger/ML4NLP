The death of longtime Los Angeles civic personality and honorary mayor Johnny Grant, who often presided at the installation of new stars at the Hollywood Walk of Fame, has been reported. He was 84.

Grant, who had lived at the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel, was found dead in his bed by members of his staff around 7:00pm Wednesday evening. Police say he died from a natural cause.

"He was supposed to appear at some kind of function and they checked on him and found he passed away on his bed," said LAPD spokesman, Officer Jason Lee.
