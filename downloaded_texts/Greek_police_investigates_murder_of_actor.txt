Police officers in Athens, Greece continue their investigation in order to find the murderer of the popular actor Nikos Sergianopoulos, who was found dead in his apartment on June 4, 2008. Athens coroner Philippos Koutsaftis stated that Sergianopoulos, 56, had been stabbed 21 times in the neck, lungs and chest, and the door had been forced. Reports from Greek television news made it known that the knife, with which the actor was stabbed, was found in the kitchen with blood on it. 

Contrary to first assumptions, police now believe that it was not a premeditated murder and that the murderer was not a close friend of Sergianopoulos. Among the findings in the apartment were a fingerprint on the door inside the flat, drug substances (probably cocaine) and 40 more fingerprints which will be analyzed in special laboratories. 

The actor had been arrested for drug possession in the Kolonos area of Athens in December 2007.

The body of Sergianopoulos has been moved to his hometown in Drama, northern Greece, where his funeral took place earlier today in the presence of co-actors and hundreds of locals.
