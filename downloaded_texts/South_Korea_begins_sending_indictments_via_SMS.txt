South Korean prosecutors plan to begin sending legal notices such as indictments and fines via SMS text messaging. The move was prompted by the high percentage of the population carrying mobile phones, as well as the cost and slow delivery of paper notices.

A South Korean official, Lee Young-pyo, said, "Most people in South Korea have mobile phones, and since the notices don't reach them immediately by regular mail, this is a more definite way for the individuals to know they have received a legal notice."

Mr. Lee also emphasized that SMS notices did not replace existing paper notification, and people must apply for the service.

About 70 percent of the South Korean population use mobile phones, according to The World Factbook.
