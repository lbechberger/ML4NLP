Scotland Yard detectives, who went to Jamaica to probe Bob Woolmer's death, came to the verdict of the murder investigation saying Bob Woolmer died of heart failure and was not murdered. Reports said the Jamaican detectives would announce at a press conference the following week that they were no longer treating the death as murder and instead believed Woolmer died of heart failure caused by chronic ill health and possibly diabetes.

On March 18, 2007, following Pakistan's shock defeat by Ireland in the 2007 Cricket World Cup a day earlier, Pakistan coach Bob Woolmer was found unconscious in his hotel room at the Jamaica Pegasus Hotel in Kingston, Jamaica and died hours later. On March 22, Jamaican police confirmed that a murder investigation has been launched due to the circumstances of Woolmer's death, specifically that he had died of asphyxia and was then being treated as a murder investigation.
