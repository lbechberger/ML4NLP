New South Wales Rural Fire Service officers called to extinguish a small bushfire in the Tomerong State Forest, about 210 kilometers south of Sydney, discovered two oil drums containing burning body parts.

The firefighters called nearby Nowra police who established several crime scenes in the area. It is believed the drums contained the remains of two people who police believe lived in the area.

NSW Police Superintendent Kyle Stewart told the ABC that officers were confronted with an horrific scene. "[It was a] fairly horrific scene, the two bodies were on fire at the time, or the barrels in which they were located, were on fire when the RFS responded and certainly that doesn't add to the pleasantness of the situation," he said.

A 27-year-old man and a 36-year-old woman have presented themselves to police. Police say they are assisting detectives with their inquiries.
