At least two homes have been evacuated, and 14 or more are on standby to evacuate in Buffalo, New York after a very large three-story building partially collapsed on the city's West Side.

According to the Buffalo Fire Department, the number four side of an old horse stable at 428 Jersey Street off of Richmond Avenue collapsed from the roof line half way down the side. Material from the building fell into the yards of at least three neighbouring houses. Some of the bricks landed inside the building, while some fell into the yards of some houses behind homes on Richmond Avenue, leaving a 'V' shape.

"[The building] is well worth the designation" as a historical landmark, states Tim Tielman of the Buffalo Preservation Board. Tielman states that he will likely bring the incident before the Board as early as Thursday, June 12 to discuss the issue.

"We don't want to demolish it until it is talked about and we consider options," added Tielman.

So far there are no reports of injuries. Firefighters plan on getting an aerial shot to determine if the building is in danger of totally collapsing. A detail will remain on scene until at least Thursday afternoon. 

The building was first owned by a company called White Bros. and was used as a stable for a farm which once covered the land around the building for several blocks. Servants and workers of the farm were housed inside resident quarters situated at the rear of the building.

The building, the current owner of which is not known, covers nearly a half block. Much of the building's sides are home to vines, and a variety of gardens are planted along the perimeter of the building. Residents state that they will be "very disappointed" to see the building be demolished.

Repairs on the building were ongoing. The building is believed to have been built in the mid-1800's.
