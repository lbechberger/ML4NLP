In a reaction to the ongoing controversy over the September publication of cartoons by the Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten, gunmen from the Fatah assaulted a European Union (EU) office in the Gaza Strip on Monday, prompting Denmark to warn citizens to avoid travel to Saudi Arabia.

The Danish newspaper issued an apology to Arab countries later Monday through Petra, a Jordanian news agency, for publishing the series of 12 cartoon depictions of the prophet Mohammad, some of which characterized him as a sort of terrorist.

The EU office was assaulted in an ordeal that lasted approximately 30 minutes. No one was reported injured and no shots were fired. The gunmen, a group of approximately 15 masked men armed with anti-tank launchers, automatic weapons, and hand grenades, burst into the office of the international observers and then withdrew several minutes later, remaining outside to keep the offices closed.

The gunmen demanded apologies from both Denmark and from Norway, where the cartoons were republished this month, threatening that citizens of those countries would be prevented from entering the Gaza Strip.
