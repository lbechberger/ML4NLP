California-based soccer club LA Galaxy triumphed 1â€“0 over Seattle Sounders FC of Washington yesterday with a header from Alan Gordon.

Both sides were missing a key player; Clint Dempsey was out for the Sounders with a hamstring injury while Robbie Keane missed the match with a groin injury. This was LA's first win since opening day and are now 2-2-2 while Seattle experienced their second loss of the season and stand at 2-2-1.

Seattle had ten opportunities on the night saved by Galaxy goalkeeper Jaime Penedo. Lamar Neagle could not find the back of the net with four on target. In the 53rd minute Sounders' Rose had a clear shot against goal; Penedo again made the save when the ball was struck directly at the keeper.

The lone goal started with a cross from Juninho on the right side which found center back Omar Gonzalez. He was able to head the ball back to Gordon who then easily scored. This ended a goal drought for LA who were scoreless for 290 minutes, last scoring on March 21 against Houston.

LA next face Sporting Kansas City at home while the Sounders continue their road trip to the Colorado Rapids.
