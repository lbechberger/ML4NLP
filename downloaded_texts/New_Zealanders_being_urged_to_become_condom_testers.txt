Condom manufacturer Durex is urging New Zealanders to sign up online to become one of 100 condom testers. Already 3,000 New Zealanders, both men and women, have applied to become condom testers, according to Durex.

Durex is recruiting the New Zealanders to test a new line of latex-free condoms.

Durex claims it is using New Zealanders to test the new condoms because, according to the company's surveys, New Zealanders are adventurous in the bedroom. Victoria Potter, spokeswoman for Durex, said: "The overwhelming response to date from Kiwis has certainly proven this."

The 100 needed people for their tests will be selected in two weeks time randomly, the final date for sending in applications is January 31, 2007.

The condom being tested is called "Durex Avanti Ultima" and is free of latex. Instead of latex, it is made of polyisoprene, the first condom to use it. Ms Potter said the new condom is "exceptionally" soft and will provide maximum comfort. The new condom will appeal to those who are allergic to latex.

Ms Potter said: "By becoming a Durex Condom Tester, Kiwis have the opportunity to get steamy in the bedroom and try out another world-leading Durex condom, all in the aid of research."
