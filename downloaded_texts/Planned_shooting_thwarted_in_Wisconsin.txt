A planned shooting was intercepted by police in Green Bay, Wisconsin. The suspects were arrested on the morning of September 14th at East High School, a day after the shooting at Dawson College. Police raided the suspects' homes and found nine rifles and shotguns, ammunition, several "crudely made" bombs, bomb-making material, camouflage clothing, two-way radios, helmets and gas masks. Nothing was found at the school upon their arrest. There was no timeline to the plan, but police say that an attack was imminent. It has been labeled as "a Columbine waiting to happen".
