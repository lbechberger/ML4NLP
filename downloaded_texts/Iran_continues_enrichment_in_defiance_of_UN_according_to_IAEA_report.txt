In response to the report, the United States says that it will seek further UN sanctions on Iran, calling the report "a laundry list of Iran's continued defiance of the international community and shows that Iran's leaders are only furthering the isolation of the Iranian people," said Gordon Johndroe, Press Secretary of the National Security Council.

"The government in Iran is not in compliance with the resolutions of the Security Council. What we have done so far is not enough. More needs to be done. The time has come to look at additional pressure... to bring about a change in Iranian calculations," said Zalmay Khalilzad, the US Ambassador to the UN.

Iran has stated that it is not "hindering" the IAEA's continuing inspections, and it will continue their cooperation with the IAEA.
