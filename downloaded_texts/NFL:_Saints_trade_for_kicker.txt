In the NFL today, the New Orleans Saints traded a sixth-round draft pick to the Miami Dolphins for kicker Olindo Mare. Mare will compete with John Carney, the Saints 44 year old kicker who has had a hard time hitting field goals over 35 yards. The Saints visited with former Dallas Cowboy and Indianapolis Colts kicker Mike Vanderjagt, but never offered anything. The Saints also used kicker Billy Cundiff last year.

Over the past ten seasons with the Dolphins, Mare amassed 1,048 points, while converting 245 of 303 field goals and 313 of 318 extra points.

Dolphins General Manager Randy Mueller indicated that Miami pursued the trade in hopes of improving future prospects. "Adding another draft pick is another chip that hopefully we can turn into a player for the Dolphins down the road," said Mueller. "We need to build this team a nucleus of young talent that has kind of been void for the last few years," he continued.

It had been speculated that Mare might be traded from the Dolphins, since they inked an off-season deal with New York Giants kicker Jay Feely.
