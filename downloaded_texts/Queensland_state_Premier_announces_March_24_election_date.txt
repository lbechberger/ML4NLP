Queensland's premier Anna Bligh has announced the state is to hold its elections on Saturday, March 24; however, in an unusual move, she did not advise the governor to issue the writs for the election.

"I intend to call the 2012 State election for Saturday the 24th of March," said Bligh, Leader of the incumbent Australian Labor Party. 

Local government elections, originally scheduled for March 31, will now be scheduled for late April. 

"Why are 73 local government elections around Queensland being pushed back? That adds more months of uncertainty when she has had a year to separate out the two elections," said Leader of the Liberal National Party, Campbell Newman. Newman will have to win the seat of Ashgrove if he is to become premier.

The two major parties are expected to face some strong competition in a number of seats from the Greens, the recently formed Katter's Australian Party, and independent candidates.

"There is undeniably a strong mood to change the government, but voters should not feel forced into giving up on their progressive views or their desire for some long-term vision and a more principled approach to politics," said Greens lead candidate Adam Stone who is contesting the Mt Coot-tha seat.

The election process is expected to formally get underway on February 19 when the premier expects to advise the governor to issue the required writs.
