The Primetime Emmy Awards will have a unique twist for 2005, as television celebrities will sing the themes of classic series. Similar to the format of reality shows like American Idol and Rock Star: INXS, the audience will be able to vote on their favorite performance during the initial broadcast of the show.

The ceremony's executive producer, Ken Ehrlich, said to the press that "There are certain television theme songs that are nearly as memorable as the shows connected to them."

Billionaire American business executive Donald Trump, of reality show The Apprentice, will accompany the high-pitched voice of actress Megan Mullally, singing the Green Acres theme. R&amp;B singer Macy Gray will be joined by Gary Dourdan of CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, as they sing "Movin' On Up", the theme to All in the Family spin-off sitcom The Jeffersons.

William Shatner of Star Trek: The Original Series and opera singer Frederica von Stade will perform the theme from Star Trek. Shatner is notorious for his musical recordings, which many criticize, as he typically speaks the lyrics instead of singing them, typically as an exaggerated interpretive reading. However, the Star Trek theme does not require any singing other than that of the female opera singer.

Kristen Bell of the series Veronica Mars will perform the theme to Fame, solo.

The show will be again hosted by talk show host and comedienne Ellen DeGeneres. In honor of the victims of Hurricane Katrina, all Emmy presenters and performers will be given magnolias, the state flower of both Louisiana and Mississippi. Information will be given out during the broadcast on how viewers can donate to relief efforts.

The Emmys will be broadcast September 18th, 2005.
