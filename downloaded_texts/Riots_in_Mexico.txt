There has been a riot in Santiago, a small town 25 kilometers from Mexico City. Violence exploded when three flower sellers were arrested on suspicion of trading without permits. 

Rioters attacked the police with sticks, machetes and petrol bombs.

Thousands of police quelled the crowd with tear gas and batons. Dozens were arrested. The arrested include peasant leader, Ignacio del Valle.

All 11 police officers held hostage by rioters were released. 

Javier Cortes Santiago, a fourteen year old boy, was killed in the riots. 

In 2002 rioters managed to cancel plans to build an airport in the town.
