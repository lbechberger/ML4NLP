Specialist James Barker, a US Army soldier in the 502nd Infantry Regiment, pleaded guilty to raping a 14 year old Iraqi girl before murdering her and her family and was sentenced to life in prison. 

Barker could face up to 90 years in jail, but is eligible for parole in 20 years. 


The incident took place in the town of Mahmudiyah, south of Baghdad in March, 2006. Five soldiers are facing charges in connection with the rape-slayings, which sparked outrage in Iraq, and led Iraqi leaders to call for a review of the immunity from prosecution given to coalition forces operating in Iraq.

Baker testified in detail about what had taken place, which led to the court-martial proceedings against three other soldiers, Pfc. Jesse Spielman, Sgt. Paul Cortez, and Pfc. Bryan Howard. A fifth soldier, Steven D. Green , who is no longer in military service, faces trial in a civilian court in Kentucky.
