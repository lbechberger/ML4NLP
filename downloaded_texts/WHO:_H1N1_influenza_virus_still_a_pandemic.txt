The World Health Organisation says that the H1N1 influenza virus, although not as intense as it has been in the past, still poses a threat and the pandemic is not yet over.

Margaret Chan, the organisation's director, commented that the pandemic alert level will remain at six, the highest possible rating. She noted that the WHO may look at the situation again in July and see if a revision is necessary then.

An emergency committee consisting of fifteen advisors stated that countries should remain on the lookout for the pandemic, and encouraged measures to be implemented for disease surveillance and control. The panel actually was held on Tuesday, but Chan didn't announce the comments until yesterday.

"We're still in the pandemic," said a spokesman for the organisation, Gregory Hartl, to the Reuters news service.
