A man from North London is currently training for an attempt at flying a hang glider across the UK from land's End to John O'Groats.

Shola Ogunlokun a 41 year old married father of 3 who had never flown a hang
glider before taking up this challenge said yesterday "I aim to fulfill a dream of
flying, use the challenge as an opportunity to meet the people of Britain and
encourage people of similar ethnic backgrounds as me to pursue their dreams".

Shola is on stage 2 of a 3 stage training programme, and has flown a glider off
a 2000ft mountain on completion of stage 1 of his training. He is currently
looking for sponsors and in talks with a TV production about making a
documentary of his attempt.

The flight attempt is currently planned for around Autumn next year, should take
between 5-7 days, and Shola would like to spend the night of each flight at the
home of a local in the town he lands. If successful, Shola will be the first
person to have flown a hang glider across the UK over this distance. 

Shola has an online diary charting his progress at http://mbchallenge.blogspot.com
