Following Barack Obama's Saturday morning text-announcement of Joe Biden's vice presidential candidacy, a rally was held in Springfield, Illinois, at 3:00pm (UTC-5).

The rally was held on the steps of the Old State Capitol building in Springfield. In a email sent out to supporters of Obama who signed up on the Obama campaign website, Obama said that "Joe and I will appear for the first time as running mates this afternoon in Springfield, Illinoisâ€”the same place this campaign began more than 19 months ago."

The rally was broadcast at the official Obama campaign site, starting at 3pm (UTC-5), and carried by major cable news networks.

Springfield owns a piece of presidential history, having been the home of former President Abraham Lincoln after he moved there in 1837. He lived there for 17 years, before taking presidential office in 1861.
