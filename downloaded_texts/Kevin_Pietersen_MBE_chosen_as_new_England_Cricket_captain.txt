Today the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) announced that Kevin Pietersen MBE has been chosen to be the new England Cricket captain. 

"I'm very thrilled and excited to have been given the opportunity to captain England," Pietersen told the BBC. He said that he would approach his captaincy like he approached his batting.

Michael Vaughan, Pietersen's predecessor, resigned Sunday in what the BBC has described as a "shock." During the news conference, the new captain paid tribute to his predecessor and said that the last few days had been an emotional time.
