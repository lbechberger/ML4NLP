Miss Gibraltar Kaiane Aldorino has won the Miss World competition of 2009, beating out the projected winner Miss Puerto Rico Mayra Matos. The first runner-up was Miss Mexico, Perla Beltran Acosta. During her acceptance speech Aldorino said “I just have no words to explain how I feel! I am just so, so happy!" In Gibraltar she is an administrative clerk with 4 years experience.

When asked what she will do after the competition, she said to the Associated Press "I will try to do the best that I can now that I have opportunity and advantage."

There has been controversy in the host city of Johannesburg, South Africa, where the competition was estimated to cost the city R90 million (€8m, US$12m). In response to criticism pageant owner Julia Morley said "Charity work is integral to the Miss World ethos and part of the brief to contenders in each country is that they volunteer their time or fundraise for charity."
