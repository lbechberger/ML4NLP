Five tourists including a child, have been killed in a car accident in Kruger National Park in South Africa. Four of the tourists were from Austria and one was from Germany. The driver survived the crash with minor injuries.

On Thursday November 29, the tourists were traveling in a Mercedes-Benz 4x4, near a gate to the park when the driver "miscalculated" the turn onto a bridge crossing the Letaba river, causing the car to plunge over the edge, flip over and fall into the river below with the roof in the river's water.

No names have been released as authorities are attempting to contact the family members of those killed. It is not known if the driver will be charged.
