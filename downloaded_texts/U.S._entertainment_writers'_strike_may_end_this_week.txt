The Writers Guild of America (WGA) strike, which has crippled entertainment productions in Hollywood since November, may be over as early as Wednesday.

In an email to its members Saturday, the WGA announced the arrangement of a tentative agreement with the studios. The union's members will vote on the agreement sometime during the next two weeks. However, a decision to return to work could be made as early as Tuesday. The WGA has recommended that its members support the contract, as it provides money to writers whose work is transmitted over the Internet.

There were two meetings held with the writers, one in New York and the other in Los Angeles where the writers seemed to be enthusiastic about getting back into business. Such shows as Desperate Housewives, the American The Office, and Grey's Anatomy will begin again if the votes go as planned.

Executive producers for TV series, sometimes called show runners, are heading back to work before the guild takes a final vote. They are preparing for the writer's return, which is now expected to be as early as Wed. Show runners are also members of the guild. They are allowed back at work Monday under the stipulation that their work only consists of producer related tasks.
