Team New Zealand has beaten Luna Rossa Challenge 5-0, thus having the right to challenge current America Cup holder, Alinghi.

Team New Zealand racing in NZL-92, beat Italian team, Luna Rossa five times in a row and won the Louis Vuitton Cup.

NZL-92 completed the race 22 seconds ahead of ITA-94, the Italian's yacht.

In the 24-year history, Team New Zealand has become the first team to defeat another team five times in a row, without losing once. Dean Barker, helsman, said that they are very proud of what they have achieved.

Both teams had not been changed for the yacht race, though Luna Rossa did make an approved change to ITA-94.

On June 23 the best-of-nine challenge for America's Cup will start. The fourth time straight New Zealand will be competing.
