At the 2001 Baseball World Cup, Cuba defended the Baseball World Cup championship, which they have dominated, by defeating USA. This time, however, things turned out differently as USA ever defeated Cuba at the 2006 Americas Olympics Baseball Qualifying Tournament with 8-5.

In the top of 2nd inning, with Cuba's starting pitcher Yadel Martí was unsteady. Justin Ruggiano started the offense for USA with a hit. After Norberto González replaced Martí on the mound for Cuba, USA scored after loading the bases and kept the lead through the end of the game.

Even though Cuba scored 2 runs with successive hits in the bottom of 5th inning, the American pitchers from the Minor Leagues effectively shut down Cuba's offense. USA eventually ended Cuba's reign as champion with a final score of 6-3. The Americans were crowned the 2007 Baseball World Cup champions, a title they last held way back in 1974. Coincidentially, Cuba did not participate in the BWC in 1974.
