A rather unimpressive Dublin side narrowly beat an even less impressive Westmeath side last night in front of a capacity (10,000) crowd at Dublin's Parnell Park to bag two points in the Allianz NFL Division 1A match.

The first half included a succession of poor wides by Dublin's forwards, but Westmeath failed to capitalise on the mistakes of their opponents, finishing the half with just three points.

The second half was a slightly better contest with a sudden burst of energy by the Westmeath forwards producing several points to bring the game back to level pegging at 0-8 to 0-8. However with several chances squandered and consistently poor passing, Westmeath fell two points behind in the final few minutes of the game.
