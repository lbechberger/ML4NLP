To help cancer patients overcoming cancer and finding a bright life, Taiwan Cancer Friends New Life Association invited more than 100 cancer patients and volunteers and held the pre-tour launch of "Passing Through Cancer, Finding Love" Eastern Taiwan Bicycle Tour Challenge from Fugang (Taidong) to ChiShinTam (Seven Star Basin, Hualien) for a new miracle.

Min-fa Lin (Secretary General of Taiwan Cancer Friends New Life Association) remarked that a cancer patient inspires this tour because the one finished a small bicycle tour from Shihlin to Tamshui, after this event known by governments and companies, Sports Affairs Council of Executive Yuan of Taiwan (SAC) supervised and Giant Co., Ltd. sponsored this Hualien-Taidong tour. He also hoped this event will inspire common people finding a bright life from a dark or hopeless life.

Huang-lang Tsai (Deputy Commissioner of SAC) remarked that SAC promoted public sports in Taiwan for a long period, and SAC respected the participation on disadvantaged people or minority. He hoped those disadvantaged people such as handicapped, cancer patients, deaf people can participate sports equally with common people, and also recommended some low-cost sports like long-distance running, walking, and bicycle riding, and hoped people in Taiwan will support "Taiwan Citizen Walking Day" at November 11, 2007.

After the speech by Tsai, he presented a symbolized flag to a delegate named Tsia-tse Kuo and hoped this trip will succeed.

This challenging tour will take place at September 23 and 24.
