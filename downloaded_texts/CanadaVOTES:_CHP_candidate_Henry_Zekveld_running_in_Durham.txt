On October 14, 2008, Canadians will be heading to the polls for the federal election. Christian Heritage Party candidate Henry Zekveld is standing for election in the riding of Durham.

Born in Lindsay and raised on a dairy farm, Henry studied at Woodstock's Fanshawe Agriculture College in 1987, the same year he joined the Christian Heritage Party. A farmer for the last 11 years, he is an active member of a local church, serving as deacon and, currently, an elder. He is a member of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, and serves on the local board of the Christian Farmers' Federation of Ontario. He ran for office as a CHP candidate Huron-Bruce (1993) and Durham (2006).
