Roy J. Glauber (Harvard University) won half of this year's Physics Nobel Prize, and
John L. Hall (University of Colorado and National Institute of Standards and Technology) and Theodor W. H채nsch (Max-Planck-Institut f체r Quantenoptik, Garching) each receive a quarter of the prize.

Glauber clarified the quantum nature of light. He showed how light composed of discrete quantum particles (photons) can be reconciled with the wave-like behavior of light. His theoretical work laid the foundations of quantum optics.

Hall and H채nsch developed methods to measure the frequency of light to extreme precisions. Their findings "have made it possible to measure frequencies with an accuracy of 15 digits," for use in highly accurate clocks and new technology for global positioning systems.

The recipients will share a 10,000,000 kronor prize (1.5 Million USD), with Glauber receiving half and Hall and H채nsch each receiving a quarter of the total.
