According to police reports, at least two people were killed and five more wounded on Friday after a gunman opened fire at a subway station in Mexico City, Mexico.

Witness reports say that two men were shouting slogans against the government in the Balderas 
station. One of them started drawing graffiti on a wall, and opened fire when a police officer tried to restrain him.

The police officer and a passerby who tried to stop the gunman were both killed.

Only one person was arrested after the incident, the El Universal newspaper reported. He was later identified as Luis Felipe Hernandez Castillo, 38.

Manuel Mondragon, the police chief, pledged to increase police presence in the subway system following the attack.
