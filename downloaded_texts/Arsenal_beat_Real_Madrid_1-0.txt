Arsenal beat Real Madrid 1-0 in a UEFA Champions League second round, first leg match on February 21, 2006. A 47th minute goal from Thierry Henry meant that Arsenal became the first side from England ever to win at the Santiago BernabÃ©u Stadium.

Arsenal generally had the better of the game, Henry's goal coming after he made a surging run from midfield, evading challenges from both Ronaldo and Thomas Gravesen before shooting low past Iker Casillas. Arsenal's Spanish forward Jose Antonio Reyes had had an early chance, which was saved by Casillas while Roberto Carlos blocked a Fredrik Ljungberg shot. At the other end, Real's David Beckham had two chances, one a missed header and the other a clear one-on-one, but Jens Lehmann saved. Late on in the game, Arsenal sub Abou Diaby could have scored a second, but Casillas saved at his feet, before Ronaldo just missed a Beckham cross in front of an open goal.

The second leg of the tie will be played at Highbury on March 8, 2006.
