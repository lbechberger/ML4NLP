Palestinian Foreign Affairs Minister Mahmoud al-Zahar said today that Hamas is against peace with Israel, will not give up the right of return of Palestinian refugees and will not recognize Israel even if a Palestinian state is created in the pre-1967 borders.

Al-Zahar also threatened Israel with response to the artillery shelling by the Israel Defense Forces at Beit Hanoun, where 19 Palestinians were killed due to machinery fault at one of the artillery stations.

The foreign minister also noted that Hamas will receive most seats in the Palestinian parliament, thus changing Palestinian Authority's policy to its liking. He also revealed that Hamas turned down Palenstinian Prime Minister Mahmoud Abbas's offer to release kidnapped Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit under Egyptian custody prior to Israel's assurance of release up to a thousand Palestinian prisoners.
