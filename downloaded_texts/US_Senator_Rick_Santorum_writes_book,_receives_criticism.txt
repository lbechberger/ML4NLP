A book by US Senator Rick Santorum (R-PA), entitled "It Takes a Family: Conservatism and the Common Good", hit stores in Washington over the weekend. Its official publication date is July 25th. Intended as a response to Hillary Clinton's book "It Takes a Village", certain passages of the book have already caused concern in certain circles. Also in the book, Santorum compares abortion to slavery, and advocates against public school systems and two income families.

Already facing perhaps the toughest re-election bid in the country, opponents and supporters of Santorum are using the book to tout their positions. T.J. Rooney, the state Democratic Party chairman, had this to say:

 "References to how families are compromised when both parents work outside the home, how it takes a societal toll on Pennsylvania families or American families, it just shows a complete lack of understanding of the real world in which the vast majority of Pennsylvanians reside." 

Although he's a Democrat himself, journalist Jules Siegel disagrees with Rooney, "From what I read in the July 10 AP story about Sen. Santorum's encounter with Hillary Clinton, I believe that he and I share common views on some aspects of child-rearing. Democrats can't handle motherhood issues because NOW-style feminists will not allow an honest discussion of what to do about the economic consequences of motherhood. Daycare is not the answer. I'm eager to see what Santorum says about right to life after birth."
 
Hillary Clinton's office refused to comment on the book.
