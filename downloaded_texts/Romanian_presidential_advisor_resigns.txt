Romania's presidential advisor for foreign policy, Andrei Pleşu, resigned yesterday from his position. The resignation was signed by President Traian Băsescu, with the 56-year-old Pleşu saying that he is withdrawing from his position due to health problems. A press release by the presidency said that, until a new advisor is named, Anca Ilinoiu will act in the position of Pleşu.

Andrei Pleşu became the presidential advisor when Băsescu was elected as the president of Romania, in December 2004. The advisor had been complaining about his health problems for a while, but was asked by Băsescu to remain in office until a replacement can be found.
