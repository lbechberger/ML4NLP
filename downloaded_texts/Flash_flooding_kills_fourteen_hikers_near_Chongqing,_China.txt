14 people have died after heavy rain and flash flooding hit a gorge near the south western city of Chongqing, China. It is reported that a group of hikers entered a forbidden area of the Tanzhangxia Gorge along with a guide. 16 members of the group of 35 were rescued but 14 died and 5 are still missing. 

The flooding was caused by a heavy rainstorm on Saturday which caused a wall of water to trigger down the gorge. One survivor said the water was “several meters high”. Deng Ke survived by grapping a bamboo shoot. 

Around 400 rescue workers are helping the rescue effort and looking for any possible survivors. Several homes and streets were flooded during the rainstorm despite the effort of the villagers who built temporary flood guards. 

Rescue efforts are ongoing.
