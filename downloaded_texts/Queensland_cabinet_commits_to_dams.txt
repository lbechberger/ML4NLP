Opposition parties in Queensland have taken exception to the state cabinet's decision to dam Teviot Brook and the Mary River. Cabinet, the executive branch of the Australian state's government, made the decision on July 3 after months of discussion and planning.

The Labor government claimed the dams are necessary to maintain supply to Brisbane, the state's capital. Declining rainfall has left the city's 1.5 million people short of water, and the population is growing rapidly. The Nationals, the main opposition party, have criticised the cost of the new dam, and propose raising an existing one instead.
