With a Queensland state election coming up in Australia, many minor parties and independents will be looking to hold balance of power and making the major parties listen to what they have to say. Patricia Petersen is one of the independents.

Wikinews reporter Patrick Gillett held an exclusive email interview with Ms Peterson, candidate for the electoral district of Bundamba.

Queensland's unicameral parliament is up for election on March 21. The election campaign will run for a total of 26 days following the issue of the writs by Governor Penelope Wensley.
