Eric Rudolph, who was on the FBI’s most wanted list and a fugitive bomber for more than five years, has reached a deal with prosecutors that gives him life in prison instead of a possible death sentence.

Rudolph will plead guilty to a string of bombings—an attack during the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, Georgia; a Birmingham, Alabama women’s clinic in 1998. He was facing trial on other bombing charges including a lesbian night club and another women’s clinic, both in the Atlanta area.

Although one of the victims said she thought the plea bargain put too little penalty on Rudolf for his crimes, prosecutors said it was better to make a deal to put Rudolf in prison for life and protect others from future attack.
