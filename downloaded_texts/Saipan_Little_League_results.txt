A number of baseball games were played in the Major Division of the 2012 Saipan Little League this past Sunday, including a game where 2011 all-star Virgil Secharmidal's Aces beat the McDonald's 13-7 with Secharmidal earning his second home run of the season. In last year's regional qualifier for the Little League World Series, the league finished tied for third in their pool and did not advance, but the CNMI team finished second in the Asia Pacific Championship for Senior League World Series. 

The Aces' victory left them third in league with a record of 6-3, behind the Dandan Comets with a record of 9-0 and JPO Enforcers with a record of 8-1. 

The Comets beat the Rays on Sunday with a score of 10-0. Five of their runs came in the first inning alone. The team, sponsored by Rep. Joseph P. Guerrero, ended the game early at the end of the fourth as a result of the mercy rule. The Pacific Amusement Rays had come into the game with a record of 5-3. 

The Natibu Sports Association Tanapag Braves beat the Bank of Saipan Red Sox 9-8, despite a 3-0 lead at the end of the second inning. The Red Sox answered back in the third inning with three runs of their own. The Red Sox scored another run in the top of the fourth, but the Braves answered back in their half of the inning with three runs. The Braves won the game with three runs in the final inning of the game.
