Marshall Faulk, the National Football League's 9th all time rushing yards leader is expected to announce his retirement from professional football March 26th at the NFL's annual owners meeting in Phoenix, Arizona.

The St. Louis Rams runningback released this statement, "It has been an honor and pleasure to play in the National Football League. I'd like to thank all my teammates and coaches with whom I've been associated over the past 13 seasons as well as the fans who supported me throughout the years. I gave the game my passion, and it gave me a wonderful career and memories that I will always be thankful for."

Faulk played for San Diego State University before being drafted by Indianapolis in 1994. After five seasons with the Colts, Faulk was traded to the St. Louis Rams, where he would lead the team to a Super Bowl championship. Faulk spent the entire 2006 NFL season on the injured reserve after having major reconstructive knee surgery.

Besides ranking 9th in career rushing yards with 12,279, Faulk ends his 13 year pro career with 100 career touchdowns, tied for sixth all-time. Faulk was named the NFL's Most Valuable Player in 2000, after setting an NFL single-season record for rushing touchdowns in a single season with 26. He was also named the Offensive Player of the Year three times in his career.
