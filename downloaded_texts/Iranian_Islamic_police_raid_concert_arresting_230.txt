Iranian police raided a dance party held 12 miles west of Tehran arresting some 230 participants. The authorities described the rock and rap performers as "satanist" without elaborating.

The raid comes as part of a recent crackdown on un-Islamic dress and hairstyles among young people in Iran. In particular, this event included some female vocalists; it is illegal for women to sing in Iran.

Rock concerts and dancing are illegal in Iran but festivals are occasionally organized illegally. In this case, the revellers were made aware of the venue only hours prior to the event.
