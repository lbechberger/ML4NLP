The winter session of the Parliament of India has begun today. Both the houses, Lok Sabha (Lower House) and Rajya Sabha (Upper House), were adjourned after paying obituaries to BSP leader Kanshi Ram and four other former MPs.

The Rajya Sabha was adjourned without transacting any business today as a mark of respect to Lalit Suri, a sitting member of Rajya Sabha who passed away on October 10, 2006.

Six newly elected members, including BJP leader Shahnawaj Hussain, newly elected Lok Sabha member from Bhagalpur constituency, and Narahari Mahato from Purulia constituency, took their oaths of office.

Three new members of the Union Council of Ministers were introduced in the Lok Sabha. The members are Defence minister A K Antony, Minister of State for Information and Broadcasting M H Ambareesh and Minister of State for Water Resources Jay Prakash Narayan Yadav.
