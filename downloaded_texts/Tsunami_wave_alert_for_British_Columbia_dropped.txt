A tsunami wave alert for the outer coast of British Columbia has been dropped. It was lifted about three hours after the alert was issued.

The alert was issued at 4:10 a.m. PST for B.C. north and central coasts to the northern tip of Vancouver Island and also the west coast of Vancouver Island south to Sombrio Point. It was expected to hit at 9:00 a.m. PST, 12:00 p.m. ET.

"That's our latest information - that if a wave was generated it would be hardly noticeable," said Cam Filmer, executive director of Provincial Emergency Planning office.

No impacts are expected from any tsunami wave that might reach B.C.'s outer coast, Emergency officials in British Columbia say.

Recent reports from Japan and Alaska indicate that any wave that might reach coastal B.C. will be very small.

Currently, there are blackouts, heavy rain and high winds throughout the area. 8,000 customers in Sechelt, Whistler, Bowen Island and Quadra Island, B.C. have no power. Winds are up to 100 kilometres an hour in some areas and rainfall amounts of 50 to 110 millimetres, Environment Canada reports.

Float plane services are cancelled between Vancouver, Victoria and Nanaimo.

Ferries are also cancelled on routes linking the mainland to Vancouver Island and the Gulf Islands.
