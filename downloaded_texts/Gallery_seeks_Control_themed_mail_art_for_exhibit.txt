Canadian community art group Visual Arts Brampton is looking for entries for its international entry mail art exhibit "Control".

The exhibit's entry information discusses the theme of the show: "Are you a control-freak, or more happy-go-lucky? What do you think of corporations' control on the media and governments? Is your life quickly spinning out of control? Always hitting Ctrl-Alt-Del?"

The exhibition dates have yet to be scheduled, but the show will run in early 2006 at either the Fridge Front Gallery or upcoming World Art Gallery in Shoppers World Brampton, a mall in suburban Toronto.

While it prefers 4 x 6 inch artworks, VAB asks that entries are no larger than 6 x 6 inches. VAB's address is "Snail Mail Central / 1 Bartley Bull Parkway, Suite 10 / Brampton ON / L6W 3T7". Entries must be received by January 31, 2006.

This show will help Visual Arts Brampton to continue to build up a reputation in the mail art world. The non-profit community art group is in the process of opening up the World Art Gallery, which will be the first permanent display space to solely exhibit mail art. Over the past few years, the club has organized three general no theme exhibits, and "SAT: An Exhibit of Chairs", which is running currently.
