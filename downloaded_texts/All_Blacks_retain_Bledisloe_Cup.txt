The New Zealand All Blacks have defeated the Australian Wallabies for the second time this year and have retained the Bledisloe Cup, winning 13-9. The win extends New Zealand lead on Tri Nations table, now seven points ahead of Australia, with the All Blacks on 13 and the Wallabies on 6. South Africa are on zero. The match was played at Brisbane's Suncorp Stadium and was time the All Blacks had played there, in ten years.

Australia had the early lead, scoring a penalty goal first up through Stirling Mortlock. The All Blacks struck back quickly though, with winger, Joe Rokocoko scoring the only try of the match, beating several defenders on his way to the line. Daniel Carter added the conversion, to give the All Blacks an 7 - 3 lead. Carter and Mortlock each added a penalty before half-time, leaving the score 10 - 6 at the interval.

The second half was very close, as was the first, with only 6 points being scored. A Daniel Carter dropped goal gave New Zealand breathing space, with Stirling Mortlock replying with a penalty. The final 10 minutes of the match saw Australia attempt to break the All Blacks defence, but failing to.

Earlier in the week Australian coach, John Connolly, stated that the new All Blacks haka Kapa O Pango should be banned, causing much controversy, citing that the throat slitting gesture at the end is a bad example.

Australia take on South Africa next week at Sydney's Telstra Stadium. Australia picked up a bonus point from the match from losing within 7 points.
