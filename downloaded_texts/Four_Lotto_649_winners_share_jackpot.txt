Three people in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) and one person in Quebec won last week's Lotto 649. They will share the second-largest lottery jackpot in Canadian history as the lucky winners of Saturday's $43.2-million Lotto 649 draw. They will each take home $10.8 million.

"Two of the tickets were purchased in the GTA, and one in southwestern Ontario, despite the free ticket giveaway by the British Columbia lottery corporation to promote the contest", the Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation said.

The six regular winning numbers for the Saturday, August 12, 2006 Lotto
649 draw were: 3 - 10 - 21 - 23 - 33 - 44 (Bonus number 43).

Eight Dollarama employees in downtown Toronto also held one of the winning tickets, worth more than $10.8 million. They will take home about $1.35 million each. They range in ages from 22 to 53.

The biggest Lotto win was $54 million in a Lotto 649 draw in October 2005. It was won by 17 oil company workers in Camrose, Alberta. Each took home a cheque for $3 million.
