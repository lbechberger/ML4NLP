A manager's mistake when entering gasoline prices into a computerized system led to prices one tenth of what was intended. The price was supposed to be set at US$3.299 per gallon (US$0.87 / litre), but was entered as US$0.329 (US$0.09 / litre). 

Customers lined up at the RaceTrac on Beach Boulevard in Miami, and filled up with the cheap gas for hours. Not one bothered to tell station employees. They were alerted when reporters from a local news agency received a tip and came on site to investigate. The mistake was promptly fixed.
