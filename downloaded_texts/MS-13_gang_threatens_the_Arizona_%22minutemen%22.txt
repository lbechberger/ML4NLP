Ebner Anivel Rivera-Paz, a leader of the vicious Mara Salvatruchas, nicknamed the MS-13 gang, issued orders from his prison cell for his followers to teach the American "Minutemen" volunteers a lesson when they begin patrolling the Mexican border today.

MS-13 gang members, considered by some to be America's most violent gang, is accused of engaging in such acts as cutting off the testicles of their enemies and feeding them to their dogs, and cutting the heads off their opponents to play soccer with. However, such allegations of brutality don't seem to frighten the "Minutemen", a group of more than 1,000 volunteers planning to patrol the Arizona-Mexico border beginning April 1st. They have been called vigilantes by President Bush and Mexican President Vicente Fox. They sometimes sarcastically refer to themselves as "undocumented border patrol agents". James Gilchrist, a Vietnam veteran and spokesman for the Minutemen, in response to the MS-13 threat said; "We're not worried because half of our recruits are retired trained combat soldiers... they [MS-13] are just a bunch of punks."

The MS-13 gang now has about 20,000 members nationwide. The US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, nicknamed ICE, began to focus on the gang with an initiative called "Operation Community Shield". The very existence of MS-13 is considered by the "Conservative Voice" to be a direct consequence of the USA government's 1980's policies in Central America; "the chickens are coming home to roost. Its MS-13 members are the sons of immigrants from El Salvador and other Central American countries that were forced to flee because of the CIA instigated war during the Reagan Administration that completely destroyed the physical, economic, social, religious and cultural infrastructure of the region. MS-13 was founded in Los Angeles by the offspring of the immigrants for protection.
