Public transport in Brisbane came to a halt following an anonymous tip-off to police over an alleged bomb on the city's mass-transit network. Trains, buses and railway stations were evacuated by authorities without elaboration on the threat. They have not yet found any evidence to support the claim.

Passengers were moved at least 100m away from buses and train stations, and all luggage was removed. All inbound and outbound services from Southbank, Roma Street, Central and Fortitude Valley stations had been affected, but now most services have resumed, albeit with delays.

Police received a "general threat" about Brisbane-bound train and bus services from an unidentified source, leading to services being suspended from 11.45am (AEST) on Monday, a police spokeswoman said.

The scare takes place against the background of the Australian Federal Government's introduction of harsh new anti-terrorism laws. Queensland Premier Peter Beattie is due to make an announcement shortly.
