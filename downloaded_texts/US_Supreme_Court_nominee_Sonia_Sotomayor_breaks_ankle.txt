Sonia Sotomayor, the U.S. Supreme Court nominee, fractured her right ankle after stumbling on her way to be seated aboard her airplane to Washington, D.C at Laguardia Airport on Monday.

She was sent to a local medical office, where an X-ray was taken. Sotomayor was later released.

She has a cast wrapped around her ankle, which has been signed by a senator. Sotomayor's cast will be replaced after 3 weeks. She has been limping on her bad ankle, but otherwise seems to be okay.

"She flew to D.C. I think it was looked at when she got here, and she was advised to go get X-rays, which she did. I think she spent a couple of hours getting the cast, and the last time I saw video, (she was) up on Capitol Hill continuing to meet with senators as part of her meetings surrounding her nomination," said White House press secretary Robert Gibbs.
