According to the El Tiempo newspaper, Colombian drug lords and rebels maintain at least 42 aircraft. The fleet includes five light Cessna planes, four reconnaissance helicopters and a helicopter set up as an air ambulance. They are also used to transport people and drugs.

The country's biggest guerrilla group, the left-wing FARC, operates between 15 and 20 aircraft, most acquired in the early 90's from defunct drug cartels.

Right-wing fighters operating in eastern and south-eastern Colombia run seven aircraft, while drug traffickers in the southeastern Valle province have between 15 and 20 aircraft.

According to a captured terrorist, the head of fighters in Meta, in central Colombia, has a Bell helicopter and a Cessna airplane for his personal use. Additionally, a drug lord in Valle province owns a private plane large enough for 14 passengers.
