Officials from TAG Heuer have announced that the company received the iF product design award, which was given away by the jury from the International Forum Design. TAG Heuer received the award for its concept watch, called Monaco Calibre 360 (Linear Second) Concept Chronograph.

The jury that gives away the iF product design awards each year consists of leading design experts from all over the world gathered in one place. The iF awards are presented in Hanover, Germany, at the International Forum Design Hannover GMBH. There are a number of fields and disciplines which have their own awards. 

TAG Heuer's Monaco Calibre 360 LS Concept Chronograph has won the award in the Leisure/Lifestyle category. The timepiece was chosen from over 2,200 watches from 35 countries. This prestigious award was given to the company for the second time in two years. Last year the winner in the same category was TAG Heuer's Professional Golf Watch, designed together with Tiger Woods. 

This year's winning timepiece from TAG Heuer has a mechanical movement, which represents the first in the history of watchmaking to reach a precision of 1/100th of a second. The watch itself is to be seen at the iF design exhibition 2007, held in Hanover, from March 15 till August.
