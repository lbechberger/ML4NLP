A helicopter crash Tuesday in Cranbrook, British Columbia left a pedestrian and the aircraft's three occupants dead. Authorities such as Canada's Transportation Safety Board continue to investigate, and have not yet identified a reason for the crash. Canadian Transport Minister Lawrence Cannon issued a statement of condolences regarding those involved in the disaster, while confirming the federal government's involvement in the investigation.

"On behalf of the Government of Canada, I would like to convey my condolences to the families of those killed in this tragic accident," said Cannon.

He continued, "We will cooperate fully with the Transportation Safety Board as they investigate this accident. Transport Canada has appointed a Minister's Observer, who will keep me informed of the investigation's progress."

He also stated that "in addition, the department will verify that the company continues to comply with all aspects of Canadian Aviation Regulations and the conditions of its air operator certificate."
