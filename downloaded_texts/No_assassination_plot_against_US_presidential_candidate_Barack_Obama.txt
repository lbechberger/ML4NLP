Police in Denver, Colorado located in the United States say that three men who were arrested on August 25 for possessing drugs and weapons were not involved in a plot to assassinate US presidential candidate Barack Obama at the Democratic National Convention that night.

"[There was] insufficient evidence of any kind of plot or threat [against Obama]", stated Troy Eid, Colorado's district attorney who also said the men were making "racist rants" while high on methamphetamines.

"The alleged threats, hateful and bigoted though they were, involved a group ofâ€¦ methamphetamine abusers, all of whom were impaired at the time. The evidence involving the alleged threats does not warrant federal charges now," said Eid. Authorities in Colorado will continue to investigate the individuals. "The law recognizes a difference between a true threat - one that can be carried out - and the reported racist rantings of a drug addict," added Eid.

The alleged threat began when an unnamed female who was with the men stated to authorities that they were shouting racists words and remarks about Obama. At least two of the men are claimed to have ties to white supremacists.

The three men are identified as Tharin Gartrell, 28, Nathan Johnson, 32, and Shawn Robert Adolf, 33. Gartrell was the first suspect arrested. Police found him driving a rental truck while weaving around the road on August 25 and with him rifles,ammunition, drugs, disguises, 2-way radios, a bullet proof vest and identification badges for three unnamed people. Johnson was arrested a short time later and Adolf was arrested trying to escape from police by jumping out of a hotel window on the sixth floor. He broke his ankle and was taken to a local hospital for treatment.

Gartrell is facing charges of possessing drugs. Adolf and Johnson are charged with illegally possessing firearms and possessing methamphetamines. Johnson was also additionally charged with possessing body armor illegally.
