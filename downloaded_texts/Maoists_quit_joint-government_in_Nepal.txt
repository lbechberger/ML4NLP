Maoists from the Communist Party of Nepal resigned en masse from their positions in the interim government on Tuesday, September 18, two months ahead of a looming election.

The bloc presented their resignations to Prime Minister Girija Koirala, who is still engaged in discussions to ensure their return. The Hindustan Times suggests that discussions are faltering, while Reuters seems more optimistic on reconciliation. 

The Maoists joined the current government last year, ending the decade-long Nepalese Civil War that sought to abolish the monarchy.
