A recent media report indicates that 75 Parkland Hospital employees in Dallas, Texas were dismissed over the past three months. These actions follow closely behind a lengthy spell of government regulatory sanctions and failed inspections at both the state and federal levels. The hospital's interim CEO did confirm for media sources that numerous employees had been "encouraged to leave" during the past few months.

The hospital hired a new chief nursing officer in January and has been reorganizing nursing services throughout the facility. In September, the hospital and federal regulators in Dallas entered into an agreement which requires the hospital to reach compliance by April 2013.

After discussing some personal experiences there, a long-time resident of Dallas, who has sought treatment at the hospital told Wikinews, "Frankly, I don't have anything positive to say about Parkland [hospital]." Our source did not want to give his name.
