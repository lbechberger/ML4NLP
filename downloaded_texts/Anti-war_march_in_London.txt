Tens of thousands of anti-war protesters marched though London on Saturday to mark the two year anniversary of the invasion of Iraq. Organisers estimated the number of marchers at over 150,000, however the police put the number at 45,000.

The march started at Hyde park and moved past the American embassy, ending in Trafalgar square. The protest was one of a number of demonstrations around the world. Protests took place in Japan, Australia, and the United States.

The protests had been called by the Anti-war Assembly of the 2005 World Social Forum, an annual conference of the alternative globalization movement which took place in Porto Alegre, Brazil in January 26-31, and were supported by coalitions from all over the world. The London protest was organised by the Stop the War Coalition.
