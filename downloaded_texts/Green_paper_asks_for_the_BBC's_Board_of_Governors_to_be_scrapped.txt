The green paper of the future of the BBC has asked for the Board of Governors to be scrapped and replaced by two boards, one representing the public and an executive board. The proposals were announced by the British Culture Secretary Tessa Jowell in the House of Commons. 

Other things she has asked for is the licence fee be kept, currently at GBP 121 (EUR 176.26) per householder, more independent television to be made on the BBC, currently 10% must be made by independent television companies &amp; to stop chasing ratings, mainly by copycating programmes from other channels. 

She said that the board of governors was “unsustainable” and lacked “clarity and accountability”. Shadow Culture Secretary John Whittingdale said that the green paper did “not go far enough” countining saying that they were “largely cosmetic changes to the structure and oversight of the BBC”. 

The green paper was made as the Charter that is the basis of the BBC is to reviewed in 2007 as required by law.
