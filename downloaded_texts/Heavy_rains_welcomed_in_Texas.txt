Recent rainfall could signal the end of the worst drought on record for the state of Texas, according to media sources. A meteorologist with AccuWeather noted recently that the rains could help lessen drought conditions which have plagued the state for months.

On Thursday, portions of Kickapoo Creek and the Neches River near Lake Palestine showed water levels several feet above their respective banks. A man who lives near Lake Palestine described last summer's drought conditions as "...unbelievable." He further stated, "[Lake Palestine] looked scary." When asked what he thought about recent rises to the lake's water levels, he told Wikinews, "It's nice." Over the recent weekend, portions of the eastern part of the state received 6â€“8 inches of rain, according to a representative with the National Weather Service.

Some parts of the state have already received double their average rainfall for the month of March.

A representative with the Regional Climate Center in Fort Worth, Texas told reporters that he anticipates seeing a "...slow but steady improvement" in drought conditions across much of the state. Certain farmers, though, have expressed concerns about the recent deluge of rain, and its potential to damage critical crops. However, cotton growers in the southern-most parts of the state have said even more rain is needed.
