A group of over 200 scientists have signed a document demanding that political action be taken following the scientific evidence that had been put forth in the last International report on climate change. The document, that had been drafted by the Climate Change Research Centre at the University of New South Wales in Australia, was presented today at the United Nations Convention on Climate change, the scientists wanting to give a strong signal to the currently ongoing negotiations. 

Unlike the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which tries to assess the current situation and what the future trends are, the 2007 Bali Climate Declaration by Scientists makes explicit recommendations to policy makers. These are twofold, one regarding the current Conference, and one future goals. On the talks here at Bali, the Declaration says it is necessary that "a new global climate treaty [...] needs to begin in December 2007 and be completed by 2009". It went on to say that "The primary goal of this new regime must be to limit global warming to no more than 2 Â°C", and that emissions would need to be cut to 40% or less than 2004 levels in order to be able to reach that goal.

Asked by which means these reductions could be achieved, Professor Richard Somerville from the United States answered that only a combination of technological advances and lifestyle changes would be sufficient to attain the proposed emission levels. 

The declaration, which is only about a page long, and its signatory list can be found at the Climate Change Research Centre's website (see below).
