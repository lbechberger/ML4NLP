South Africa have beaten England 15-6 in the 2007 Rugby World Cup Final at Stade de France in Saint-Denis, France.

Percy Montgomery kicked South Africa into the lead with a penalty after seven minutes. Soon afterwards Jonny Wilkinson kicked a penalty to equalise for England but Montgomery restored South Africa's lead just three minutes later. A push from England led to a drop goal opportunity for Jonny Wilkinson, but the kick was wide. Francois Steyn missed a chance to extend the lead with a penalty at long range, but South Africa went into half time leading 9-3 when Montgomery added his third penalty just before the interval.

Soon after the restart Mark Cueto crossed South Africa's try line out wide, but television replays showed that he had just gone in to touch. Jonny Wilkinson scored a penalty to reduce the deficit to three points, but Steyn and Montgomery each scored a penalty to win the match for South Africa.

Both teams had met in the pool stages, where South Africa won comprehensively. However England regained their form to reach the final with victories over Australia and France. South Africa had little trouble reaching the final, with comfortable victories over Fiji and Argentina. South Africa claim their second World Cup victory since 1995, while England lose the title they won in 2003.
