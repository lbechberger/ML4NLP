Three American hostages - Marc Gonsalves, Thomas Howes, and Keith Stansell - that were being held in Colombia by FARC are now free. They are safely in Florida after their rescue by Colombian forces; 12 other hostages were rescued at the same time. They received care from the Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio before being sent home to their families. The men were taken captive when their drug surveillance plane went down in the jungles of Colombia in 2003 - more than 5 years ago. All three of the men were working for a subsidiary of Northrop Grumman Corporation at the time.

Keith Stansell emphasized that while he was grateful to be home, no one should "forget the people that are still there". "Because of our rescue, there are fellow hostages that are still there," Stansell said. He reminded those listening that some of the remaining hostages have already been in captivity for 10 years, in squalid conditions. "You wait for a day like yesterday and today, you know, for the end, you... you want it to end," added Marc Gonsalves.
