After testing positive for marijuana amid the latest drug test, former NFL star Michael Vick was placed under tighter restrictions by U.S. District Judge Henry Hudson.

Vick must be home between between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m. and he must submit to random drug tests that will be conducted in the future.

Hudson also ordered that Vick may have to attend and pay for inpatient or outpatient substance therapy and mental health counseling if a supervising officer deems so.

A document filed in U.S. District Court today said Vick tested positive amid a urine sample that was submitted on September 13, 2007.

Vick is scheduled for sentencing on December 10 for bankrolling a dogfighting operation on his property.
