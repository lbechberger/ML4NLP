Border patrols at Britain's airports may be left short-staffed as the Public and Commercial Services Union (PCS) have voted to strike for twenty-four hours next week on Thursday, July 26, the day before the opening of the 2012 Olympic Games in London. PCS members working in the Home Office, which operates the Border Agency, voted for the strike on Wednesday to protest against the loss of jobs at the Home Office, as well as pay and conditions of workers.

Following the strike, union workers will also take other action including working to rule and a ban on overtime.

Prime Minister David Cameron has condemned the strike: "I do not believe it will be right. I do not believe it will be justified." 

Jeremy Hunt, the culture secretary, said the behaviour of the PCS was "totally irresponsible". Theresa May, the Home Secretary, described the strike as "shameful" and noted the government will put in contingency arrangements.

Mark Serwotka, the head of the union, described the government's reaction as "hysteria" and claimed "there'll be no disruption to the Olympics".
