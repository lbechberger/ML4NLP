The Qatar-based Arab news channel Al Jazeera has aired a new video which was made five or more years ago featuring Osama bin Laden meeting with two men that the FBI accuse of being September 11, 2001 hijackers, Saudi nationals Hamza el-Ramdi and Wael el-Shemari.

Wael el-Shemari was found days after 9/11, alive and well, by a BBC News investigation, which states, "he is protesting his innocence from Casablanca, Morocco." At least four other men accused of hijacking planes on September 11 have also turned up alive.

In the video, Bin Laden is seen meeting with his former lieutenant Mohammed Atef. The video also shows bin Laden meeting with Ramzi Binalshibh who is also believed to be one of the masterminds of the attacks. Atef was killed in an airstrike, by the United States in 2001 located in Afghanistan. Binalshibh has been in U.S. custody for at least four years. 

The video, shows the alleged hijackers "preparing for the attacks and practising their execution" in Afghanistan according to BBC News. 

It is not known how Al Jazeera got the video.
