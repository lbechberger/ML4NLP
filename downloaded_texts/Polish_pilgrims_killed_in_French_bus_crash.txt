A bus carrying 50 Polish people (47 pilgrims and a three person crew) crashed today near Grenoble in France. According to police, there are 26 dead and 24 injured.

The Poles, many of them elderly, had been attending a pilgrimage at the nearby Notre-Dame de la Salette sanctuary. Emergency workers say the bus suffered a problem with its brakes while on a steep descent. It left the roadway and fell in a river below, where it burst into flames.
