A late try by the Australian Wallabies substitute, Mat Rogers caused the South African Springboks heartbreak in tonight's match at Sydney's Telstra Stadium. Australia won the match 20â€“18, their second in this year's Tri Nations.

Australia led the Springboks 10 points to nil at half-time, which stretched Australia's hold over the Springboks to zero three halves of football, as the Wallabies had previously beaten South Africa 49 to nil in Brisbane. It was Mark Gerrard who scored Australia's first half try, along with a conversion and penalty goal to Stirling Mortlock.

The Springboks hit back in the second half, with tries to Jaque Fourie and Percy Montgomery. The Springboks now led Australia, looking to wrap up their first win of this year's series. However, replacement Phil Waugh, playing his 50th match, came on and made a break down field, off-loading to replacement back Rogers, who scored in the left corner to tie the scores up. Mortlock kicked the conversion, which hit the post, but bounced through to win the match.
