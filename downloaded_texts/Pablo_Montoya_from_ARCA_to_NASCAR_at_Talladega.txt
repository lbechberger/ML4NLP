Juan Pablo Montoya, who retired from Formula One before the 2006 French Grand Prix, drove his first laps in a NASCAR stockcar yesterday owned by Chip Ganassi whom he is to race for in the 2007 NASCAR Nextel Cup season.

The test occurred at the Talladega Super Speedway where on Saturday he competed in an ARCA race in which he finished third.

The Monday test also allowed NASCAR to test the COT ("Car of Tomorrow") which will be raced next year in select events.

Montoya was the 1999 CART FedEx Championship Series champion. In 2000 he won the Indianapolis 500 as a rookie driving for the same Chip Ganassi Team.
