On Tuesday night, the National Weather Service issued a tsunami bulletin for the Pacific coast from the California-Mexico border to Vancouver, Canada, after a 7.0 magnitude earthquake occurred approximately 80 miles off the coast of Northern California at 19:50 PDT.

The warning has now been cancelled. The quake's motion was horizontal, not vertical (the movement that typically leads to a tsunami).

Witnesses along the California coast reported buildings shaking, but no major damage or injuries were reported.

Details of the earthquakes which have taken place in the past week (including the three major earthquakes which have taken place in, or close to, the Americas over the last 24 hours) can be found at http://earthquake.usgs.gov/
