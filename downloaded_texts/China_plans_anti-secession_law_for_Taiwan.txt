The People's Republic of China government plans to pass an anti-secession law, aimed at preventing a declaration of Taiwan independence. The law shows the "strong determination of the Chinese people" and will "never allow secessionist forces working for 'Taiwan independence' to succeed at breaking away from the mainland" according to an announcement made by China's Premier Wen Jiabao at the National People's Congress in Beijing.

The Chinese State Council is also planning to increase the country's military budget by 12.6 percent, to US$29.98 billion, for the current fiscal year.

The anti-secession law, as well as the military budget increase will both be discussed during the parliamentary meetings which begin today, and continue for the next 12 days. Over 3,000 delegates assembled in the Great Hall of the People today to listen to Wen's two hour speech and begin discussions.

Taiwanese politicians reacted with disappointment to the planned anti-secession law, and promised protests in the streets of Taipei and Kaohsiung this Sunday. Taiwan's President Chen Shui-bian even threatened to introduce an "anti-annexation" law to oppose China's move.
