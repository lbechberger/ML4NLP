Australian national football coach Pim Verbeek has named the Socceroos team to participate in the teams remaining qualifiers for the 2010 FIFA World Cup.

All but one of the squad play in foreign leagues. Jason ÄŒulina, who has signed with Gold Coast United FC, is the exception.

Rhys Williams and Dario Vidosic were called up to the national team for the first time after impressing for their respective clubs.

Williams has previously represented the Wales national under-21 football team on ten occasions but recently declared his desire to be selected in the Australian senior side.

Long-time national team member Mark Viduka was left out of the 30-man squad. Coach Verbeek gave Viduka a week to decide whether he wants to be part of Australia's plans in the future.

"He has this week to make up his mind," Verbeek said. "I have one spot open and that's the spot for him. It's up to him. We all know his situation at Newcastle, a very tough year, a long time injured, missed a lot of games, played the final five or six games in a row, relegated, end of contract and not the youngest player anymore, so I think he has enough things on his mind. If he makes the decision not to play anymore, then we have to respect his decision." 

Nick Carle, Brad Jones, Adrian Madaschi, Mark Milligan, Matthew Spiranovic and Shane Steffanuto, who have been out of the side for varying lengths of time, all return for the qualifiers.

Australia currently head Group A in round four of Asian Football Confederation qualifying. They need to one point (a draw) from their remaining three games to qualify for the World Cup in South Africa.
