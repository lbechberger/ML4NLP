Officials have said that at least three people were killed after a car bomb detonated in the Indian-administered province of Kashmir on Saturday.

The explosion occured in the city of Srinagar's main jail. Two police officers and a civilian were among the dead, and ten more police officers were wounded after the blast, several of them in critical condition.

Hemant Lohia, a senior police official, said explosives were inserted into a car and detonated by remote control as a police bus drove by.

Nobody has taken responsibility for the explosion, although the attack has been blamed on Muslim separatists, who have had an insurgency in the area since 1989. Clashes in the past month have increased, following a lull in violence.
