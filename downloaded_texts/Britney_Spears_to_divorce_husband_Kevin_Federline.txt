In Los Angeles, California singer and actress Britney Spears, 24, has filled papers in Los Angeles County Superior Court to divorce her husband Kevin Federline, 28. A spokeswoman for the court, Kathy Roberts stated that the papers cited "irreconcilable differences" as the reason for the divorce and have, according to the courts, been legally separated as of Monday, November 6, the same day that Spears appeared on Late Night with David Letterman. The fact that the papers were filed on the same day as the U.S. general elections prompted ABC News to speculate that the star may have been hoping to receive less attention amid national election coverage.

The two were married on October 6, 2004, according to the petition, a date that E! Online noted was in conflict with a photo spread in People, which gave their wedding date as September 18, 2004. The couple currently have two sons, the first named Sean Preston, 1, and a recent baby boy named Jayden James Federline who was born on September 12, 2006. Spears is attempting to gain both full legal and physical custody of both of the children with Federline having visitation rights. 

It is also reported that Spears did not accept spousal support and waived her right to receive any, also asking that the legal fees incurred during the divorce be separated.

Neither Spears nor Federline has yet released a statement.
