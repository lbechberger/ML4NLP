In Lebanon Sunday, protesters set fire to the building housing the Danish mission. About 200 people were detained by police, 30 were injured and at least one person died according to officials. Prime Minister Fuad Saniora said 76 Syrians, 35 Palestinians and 38 Lebanese were arrested.

Ghazi Aridi,Lebanese Information Minister, said that the Lebanese government had unanimously "rejected and condemned the ... riots," which "harmed Lebanon's reputation and its civilized image and the noble aim of the demonstration." 

"The Cabinet apologizes to Denmark," said Aridi.
