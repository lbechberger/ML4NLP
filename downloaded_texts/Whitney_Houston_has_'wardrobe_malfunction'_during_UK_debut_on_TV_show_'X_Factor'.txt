American singer Whitney Houston's debut performance in the United Kingdom didn't go exactly to plan on Sunday night, causing a bit of controversy.



During her performance of her new single Million dollar Bill on the UK television show The X Factor Sunday evening, she experienced a 'wardrobe malfunction'. The strap on her back, holding her dress together, suddenly snapped off about midway through her performance. She also had a difficult time walking and dancing on the stage, as her dress appeared to be too long. Houston carried on and at no time stopped the performance.

"I sang right out of my dress," Houston said after her performance to the show's host Dermot O'Leary.

X Factor fans began to complain on the show's website as a result of the interview with O'Leary. Some accused Houston of being on drugs, because of her shaky voice while being interviewed. Other fans called her performance "a waste of talent" and disappointing. However, other fans criticized those who made the comments telling them to "put the past behind" them. 

Houston has not responded to the accusations. It has been over a decade since Houston last performed in the UK.
