Disney studios have pledged to leave all forms of smoking out of their family films in a bid to discourage the habit.

In a letter to US Congressman Edward Markey, Chief Executive Robert A. Iger stated that smoking in Disney brands will be "non-existent" from now on. He also stated that DVD's that show cigarettes will now carry anti-smoking messages.

Mr Markey said that he is pleased that "Disney is embracing a policy that is consistent with the long-term public health of the nation", and called the move by the media giant "groundbreaking".

"Now it's time for other media companies to similarly kick the habit and follow Disney's lead."

Disney films have rarely depicted smoking in recent years, although several instances in the past exist. For example, in the 1953 Disney film Peter Pan, there is a scene depicting smoking at a Native American camp.
