London, England— Tuesday evening saw Zsuzsanna Krajnyak, of Hungary, take bronze in the women's wheelchair fencing individual foil category A. She defeated fellow Hungarian Veronika Juhasz by a score of 15 to 4.

The bout was the first of four concurrent medal matches to end, with Juhasz unable to score a hit until Krajnyak had already amassed five. Juhasz's final hit was scored when Krajnyak was ahead with 11 hits. The match was penalty free, despite Krajnyak rocking in her wheelchair as she parried with her opponent. 

When Krajnyak was asked by the media about her victory over her fellow countrywoman, she said: "It was good to know that Hungary had secured a medal [before the bout] — it proves Hungary has a strong fencing history." 

The Paralympic campaign is not over for Juhasz or Krajnyak, both are scheduled to compete in the Women's Individual Epee - Category A event and the Women's Team - Category Open event.

At the London Games, Paralympic wheelchair fencing features five medal events for women and sven for men, using several weapons including the foil, epee and sabre. Wheelchairs used in competition are held in place using medal plates, with the fencer with shorter reach choosing the distance between the chairs. A-classified wheelchair fencers have, according to the International Paralympic Committee, "good sitting balance and good trunk control with their fencing arm not affected."
