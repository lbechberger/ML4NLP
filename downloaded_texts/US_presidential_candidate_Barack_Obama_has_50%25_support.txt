United States presidential candidate Barack Obama now has 50% support in the polls. John McCain had a statistical lead over Barack Obama after the Republican National Convention. However, since the middle of September, Barack Obama's polls have risen and he has recaptured the lead. Tuesday was the first day Obama received 50% or more support in the Day to Day Politics Poll Average since it began back in mid July. Barack Obama now has 50.1% support and John McCain has 43.6% support - a 6.5% difference with a margin of error of 0.70%. 

This is the largest lead Barack Obama has had in the past three months. The last time Obama's lead was near this high was September 1, 2008 when it was 6.0% after the Democratic National Convention. For the past three weeks, the Gallup and Rasmussen three day tracking polls have held a lead for Obama. 

According to the Gallup poll, their latest poll ties the largest lead that Obama has had in the previous three months, when it reached 9.0% at the end of Obama's international trip in late July. The Gallup three day tracking poll, the Rasmussen three day tracking poll, and the latest CNN poll all have Barack Obama over 50%. There are still a Day to Day Politics Poll Average of 6.3% of voters who have not committed to Barack Obama or John McCain.
