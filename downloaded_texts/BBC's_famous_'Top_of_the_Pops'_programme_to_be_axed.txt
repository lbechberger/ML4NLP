The BBC has confirmed that its famous Top of the Pops music programme is to be axed this summer, after Media Guardian broke the news. The programme began on New Year's Day in 1964 and has featured most of the top bands and artists ever since.

The last show will be on July 30, 2006.

The Controller of BBC Two, Roly Keating, said "I've really enjoyed the last year that Top of the Pops has transmitted on BBC Two and the team did a sterling job in revitalising the format for our audience, but we all recognise that the time has come to move on."
