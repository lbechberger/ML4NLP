MADRID, Spain â€” Floyd Landis requested the testing of his backup urine sample today.

"We've sent the fax to the UCI this afternoon." "Now we'll have to adjust to their calendar," said Jose Maria Buxeda, one of Landis's two Spanish lawyers, of the Swiss-based International Cycling Union. Landis's lawyers say they fully expect the backup test to confirm the original finding.

Oscar Pereiro of Spain, who finished second overall in the Tour de France, would be declared the winner if Landis loses the title.

Results will be revealed during the week.
