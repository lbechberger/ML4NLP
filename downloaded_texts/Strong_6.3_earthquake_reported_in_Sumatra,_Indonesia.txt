According to the United States Geological Survey, a magnitude 6.3 earthquake has been recorded in northern Sumatra, Indonesia at 3:02 p.m. local time [08:02 (UTC)].

The epicenter was approximately 83 kilometers [51 miles] WSW of Banda Aceh, Sumatra, at a depth of 30 kilometers [18.6 miles].

There are no reports of damages, injuries or deaths, according to the Jakarta geophysics agency, but the USGS does report that there is a potential for "light to moderate damage" on the northwest end of the island. 

No tsunami warning has been issued, and according to the Jakarta geophysics agency, no tsunami warning will be issued because the quake did not meet the magnitude 6.5 requirement. Despite there being no tsunami threat, residents started to panic and began to leave their businesses and homes.

In 2004, a massive tsunami struck the island after a magnitude 9.2 quake rattled the region killing over 200,000 people.
