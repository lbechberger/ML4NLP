British police have announced there is a possible bomb threat to central London. Reports indicate the warning may have come from Irish republican dissidents opposed to the peace process, only a day before Elizabeth II is to travel to Ireland.

"A bomb threat warning has been received relating to central London today," Metropolitan Police force said in a statement this afternoon. "The threat is not specific in relation to location or time." There are suggestions the warning may have come to the police last night in coded form.

Sky News has reported sources have indicated the threat was made by Irish republican dissidents, although British police tried to play down fears. "The threat level from Irish-related terrorism has not increased and remains at substantial," they said in the statement.
