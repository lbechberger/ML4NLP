In Thailand's troubled southern province of Pattani, a Buddhist monk was among three killed by insurgents attacking a temple.

Around ten suspected muslim militants took part in the fifteen minute long attack in the early hours of Sunday morning, leaving the 76-year-old monk, Kaew Panjapetchkaew, with his throat cut. They then proceeded to use gasoline to set fire to part of the temple. Upon putting out the fire, police investigators found the bodies of two teenage boys who had been helping at the temple. Both had died from gunshot wounds.

In an effort to conceal the attack, the insurgents had let off fireworks earlier thus distracting nearby villagers and police.
