According to United States President George W. Bush, CIA director Porter Goss has resigned.

"He has led ably. [He] helped make this country a safer place. He has a five-year plan to increase the analysts and operatives. He honours the proud history of the CIA, an organization that is known for its secrecy and accountability. We've got to win the war on terror," said Bush in a press conference on Friday.

"I would like to report to you that the agency (CIA) is back on a very even keel and sailing well," said Goss.

The reasons for Goss's resignation are not yet known and as of the moment, the President has announced no replacement.

Goss was appointed as the CIA's director in 2004 and served as director for 19 months. He was previously an undercover agent for the organization and was also a member of the U.S. House of Representatives for 16 years.
