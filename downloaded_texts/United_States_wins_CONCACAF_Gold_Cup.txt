The United States men's soccer team have won the 2007 CONCACAF Gold Cup by defeating Mexico 2-1 at Soldier Field in Chicago.

Mexico took the lead shortly before halftime with a goal from Jose Andres Guardado.

The Unites States leveled the scores when Landon Donovan converted a penalty in the 62nd minute and took the lead 11 minutes later from a goal by Benny Feilhaber.

Feilhaber's goal was only his second international goal. Donovan's 34th international goal ties him for first place with Eric Wynalda among all-time US men's nationals. The United States were the defending champions and hosts for the twelve-team biennial event.
