Chinese police are offering a reward of 300,000 yuan (US$43,900) over twin bombings on morning bus services earlier this week. Two people were killed in the attacks in Kunming.

The explosions were both on route 54 and were caused by small nitroamine devices. Fourteen were wounded. The reward is triple the amount initially offered after the Monday attack.

The first explosion was at 7:10 a.m. at Panjiawan Bus Stop on West Renmin Road. The second was on a bus at the intersection between Changyuan Road and West Renmin Road at 8:05 a.m. The second bus was close to its last stop of Minshan.

Police are now asking anyone who used a route 54 bus between 6:00 and 8:30 a.m. that day to come forward.
