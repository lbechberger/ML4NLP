U.S. Democratic Party presidential candidate Senator Hillary Clinton has been asking webizens to vote on her official campaign song. Campaign Manager Patti Solis Doyle sent an email today to previous voters, urging them to choose a song in the second and final round of voting.

Clinton, as many of the other candidates, have been using "Web 2.0" applications like YouTube, Flickr, MySpace, Facebook, and blogs to try and engage young voters.

The top five songs in Round One were "Suddenly I See" by KT Tunstall, "Rock This Country!" by Shania Twain, "Beautiful Day" by U2, "Get Ready" by The Temptations, and "I'm a Believer" by Smash Mouth. Five top write-ins were also added to the list of round 2 nominees: "Are You Gonna Go My Way" by Lenny Kravitz, "Ain't No Stoppin' Us Now" by McFadden &amp; Whitehead, "Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic" by The Police, "You and I" by Celine Dion, and "The Best" by Tina Turner.

Many of the nominated songs are from international artists; Tunstall is Scottish, Twain is Canadian, and U2 are Irish.
