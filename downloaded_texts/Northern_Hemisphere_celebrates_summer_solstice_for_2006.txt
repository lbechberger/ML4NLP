Around 17,000 people converged on the ancient monument of Stonehenge this morning to celebrate the northern hemisphere's summer solstice. Despite a night of torrential rain, spirits were high as the sun rose over the horizon, though clouds blocked out the dawn for much of the event.

The summer solstice is the longest day of the year, having the greatest length of time between dawn and dusk. Stonehenge is constructed so that on the dawn of the solstice, the sun appears in the centre of one of the stone structures. Pagan rituals have taken place at this time every year for many centuries.
