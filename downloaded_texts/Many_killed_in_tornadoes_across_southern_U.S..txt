Tornadoes have been reported across the southern United States, with some sources saying as many as 48 have died. The NOAA have reported that several buildings have been damaged in the tornadoes, including a hospital in Arkansas. 
 
At least 69 tornadoes have been reported to have taken place in the last two days, most of which took place on the same day as US citizens were voting in caucuses and primaries on a day known as super Tuesday.
