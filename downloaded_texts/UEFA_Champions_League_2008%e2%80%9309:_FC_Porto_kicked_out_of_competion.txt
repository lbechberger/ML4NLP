The UEFA Control and Disciplinary Body has decided that FC Porto will not participate in next season's UEFA Champions League after it's bribery scandal.

UEFA said on their website, "The UEFA Control &amp; Disciplinary Body considered that the offences related to the judgement in Portugal corresponded with "an activity aimed at arranging or influencing the outcome of a match," as stated in Article 1.04 (d), and that the condition set out in this provision would therefore not be met by Porto. The decision is open to appeal within three days of the sending of the decision."

FC Porto were also deducted 6 points and received a fine of â‚¬150,000 by the disciplinary committee of the Professional Portuguese Football League for the same incidents.
