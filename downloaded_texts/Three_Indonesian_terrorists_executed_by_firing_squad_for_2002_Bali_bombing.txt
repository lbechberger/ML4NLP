The three Islamic militants found guilty of the 2002 Bali bombing have been executed on the island of Nusakambangan. Huda bin Abdul Haq, Amrozi bin Nurhasyim and Imam Samudra were executed by firing squad shortly after midnight. It had been announced that the three would be killed in November but no date was given prior to the shooting. 

All three were convicted for the October 12, 2002 Bali bombings which killed 202 in the tourist district of Kuta. The blast killed tourists from 21 different countries and 38 Indonesian citizens. The bombings were blamed on the militant group Jemaah Islamiah.

According to a BBC correspondent, "The deaths will not evoke much sympathy in Indonesia and many people believe the executions should have been carried out much sooner". The bombers made several appeals with the latest being a week before the execution; all were rejected by the Supreme Court.
