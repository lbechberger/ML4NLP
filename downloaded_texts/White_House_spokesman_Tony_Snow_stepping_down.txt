White House spokesman Tony Snow announced today that after a long battle with colon cancer, he will be stepping down as the White House spokesperson. Mr. Snow has served the White House since May 8, 2006.

"It's been a joy to watch him spar with you," said Bush. "He's smart, he's capable, he's witty, he's able to talk about issues in a way the American people understand," Bush continued. "I don't know what he's going to do, I'm not sure he does yet either," Bush said. "One, he'll battle cancer and win, and secondly he'll be a solid contributor to society."

Tony Snow said that he will be leaving the White House due to financial restrictions because of the cost of chemotherapy. Snow had previously announced that he would be leaving prior to when Bush's term ends in January of 2009.
