The American TV show Alias will end in May 2006 after five seasons, ABC said Wednesday. No reason for the cancellation has been given. 

Alias stars Jennifer Garner as top secret CIA agent Sydney Bristow. Garner has won a Golden Globe and a Screen Actors Guild award for her performances in the show.

Alias currently airs Thursdays at 8:00 PM EST on ABC. This has led to a drop in ratings as it is opposite CBS' popular reality TV show Survivor: Guatemala.

Last season Alias averaged 10.3 million viewers per week according to Nielsen Media Research. This season they only averaged 7 million viewers per week.
