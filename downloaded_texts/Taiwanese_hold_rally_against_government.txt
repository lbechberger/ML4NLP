Tens of thousands of protestors rallied in the streets of Taiwan on Sunday against president Ma Ying-jeou's engagement policy with China.

Protestors claim Ma's policies could possibly undermine the country's self-rule. The march was lead by the chairman of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party, Tsai Ing-wen.

The march comes a few days before the anniversary of the president's appointment, which is due on Wednesday.

The opposition claims that Ma will weaken the sovereignty of Taiwan, if he follows through on his pledge to abandon the anti-Chinese policies of his predecessors.

China claims sovereignty over the island nation, which split from the former when the Chinese Civil War ended in 1949. China has said numerous times that it will regain rule over Taiwan, even if it means using force.
