The most complete dinosaur to be found in the United Kingdom has recently been put on public display. The scelidosaurus dinosaur was discovered on the Dorset coast, from which it was moved to Bristol City Museum &amp; Art Gallery for public display. The director of Geology for the museum said, before the display was opened to the public, that "this is certainly a coup for Bristol." He then said that the museum was "pleased to have these outstanding specimens, [as] they are the best-preserved dinosaur remains ever found in England."

Large numbers of people have visited the museum in the last few days to see the dinosaur, which is believed to have died in a flood. The remains of the dinosaur's final meal are visible near the neck of the animal.

The children of the dinosaur were also recovered in Dorset, and they have been included in the display at the Bristol museum. 

The scelidosaurus was a herbivorous dinosaur that lived in the Jurassic period, almost 200 million years ago.
