Former West Coast Eagles champion and television presenter Chris Mainwaring (Mainy), 41, died in the early hours of October 1. The cause of death is believed to be a seizure. St John Ambulance was called to Mainwarings home just after midnight and found him unconscious. Mainwaring was pronounced dead shortly after arrival at Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital. 

Earlier in the evening police had been called to a disturbance at the same address. When they arrived Mainwaring was calm and refused assistance. He was placed in the care of a neighbour and returned home.

Police are investigating his death and will report their findings to the Coroner, a standard procedure for unexplained deaths. The street has been closed off and police are interviewing neighbours. 

Seven News released a statement just before midday about the tragic loss, managing director Chris Wharton said, "Mainy was part of the heart and soul of Channel Seven Perth, and we will all miss him very, very dearly..."

"Our thoughts must go to Chris' family, especially Rani and the children for their sad loss."
