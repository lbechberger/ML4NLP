Chilean and Peruvian government websites have both experienced attacks by unknown suspects, according to BBC News.

The attacks are reported as being in connection with a dispute over fishing rights in the Pacific Ocean, and may have to also do with Alberto Fujimori's detention in Chile awaiting extradition to Peru.

The most recent messages (on the Peruvian Judiciary's web page) are believed to be the work of a Chilean hacker. According to Peru the attacks may be in response to an earlier incident in which the Chilean National Emergency Office's page was struck. (BBC News)
