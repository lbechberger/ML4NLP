Performances by Sir Elton John and the English National Ballet featured in the Concert for Diana, held in Wembley Stadium, London on Sunday to commemorate the late Diana, Princess of Wales life on what would have been her 46th birthday. 

As a result of the terror attacks in the United Kingdom on the days prior to the event, heightened security precautions were in force, with a high police presence around the venue, and bag searches taking place. Despite the security fears, over 63,000 attended the concert. It was televised to 120 countries around the world, with a potential audience of 500 million.

The concert, broadcast by the BBC, featured acts from many groups and individuals including Sir Elton John, and the English National Ballet. It was hosted by Princes William and Harry and opened and closed by Sir Elton John, who is remembered for having played a unique rendition of Candle in the Wind at the Princess' funeral. 

Performances were interspersed with tributes from various public figures including Tony Blair, the former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, and Nelson Mandela, the former President of South Africa. Films showing parts of Diana's life, with testimony from those who worked with her, were also aired, publicising the Princess' work around the world, which was to be supported by profits from the concert.
