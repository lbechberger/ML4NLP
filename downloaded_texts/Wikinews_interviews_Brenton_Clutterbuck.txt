Wikinews contributor Patrick Gillett recently interviewed Brenton Clutterbuck about his project on Discordianism.

"I'd like to add something to the knowledge base of what we know about Discordianism," says Clutterbuck. "I want to work on a piece that follows a travel narrative structure." In 2009, Clutterbuck was interviewed — by the same contributor — in his capacity as an election candidate.
