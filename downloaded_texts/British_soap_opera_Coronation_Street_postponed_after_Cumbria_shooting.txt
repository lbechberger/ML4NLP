An episode of the British soap opera Coronation Street has been postponed after it was due to air on the same day as a string of shootings in Cumbria occurred. The episode, due to be broadcast on ITV last night, featured a siege and hostage situation heavily involving guns.
 
The soap was replaced with an episode of Harry Hillâ€™s TV Burp. ITV released a statement "ITV has postponed tonight's episode of Coronation Street out of respect to those affected by today's tragedy. Coronation Street will be replaced by a compilation episode of TV Burp."

The broadcast was shelved after a man shot dead 12 people and injured several more in Cumbria. This episode of Coronation Street is one of a six part collection of episodes. They took around four weeks to film.
