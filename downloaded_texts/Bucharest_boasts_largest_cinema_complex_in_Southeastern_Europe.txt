The largest multiplex cinema complex in Southeastern Europe opened on Friday in Bucharest, the capital of Romania. The cinema is operated by Movieplex Italy and is located in the Plaza Romania shopping centre. Robert Longhi, the general manager of Movieplex, said that the value of the investment reached 4.7 million euro. It is estimated that, during the first year of activity, the cinema will attract one million customers.

Plaza Romania is one of the newest shopping centres in Bucharest, having opened in October 2004 after a 45 million euro investment by Anchor Group, a Turkish company, which also invested in the Bucharest Mall, another large shopping centre in the Romanian capital.
