This week, a taste of autumn is in the air throughout northern portions of the United States. Cold air is slowly seeping in from the arctic, and the leaves are just beginning to change in certain areas as summer fades away. 

In the Northeastern U.S., fall colors have begun to arrive atop mountains in parts of Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont and New York. The highest elevations of the Adirondack Mountains are already at their mid-point in terms of fall foliage. However, most trees remain green in the Midwest and the Southeast, with some color on a few diseased trees.

Parts of the Western United States, especially higher elevations of Utah, have reported slight to moderate color.
