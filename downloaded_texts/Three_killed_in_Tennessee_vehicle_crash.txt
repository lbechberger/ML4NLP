Three teenagers were killed and two others were seriously injured near Dyer, Tennessee, United States early Tuesday afternoon when a driver with a restricted learners license, lost control of her sport utility vehicle, ran off the road, and struck several trees. Kayla Pate, 16, lost control of her vehicle when her right tires left the road and she attempted to swerve back onto it.

Two teens were pronounced dead on the scene and one later died in hospital. The deceased were identified as 17-year-old Ryan Williams, 15-year-old McKenzie Coble, and 15-year-old Anthony Jones. Driver Pate and another passenger, Hope Jones, were seriously injured. None of the teens were wearing seatbelts.

Tennessee's Graduated Driver License stipulates that drivers under 18 can have only one passenger in a vehicle unless he or she is accompanied by a licensed driver more than 21 years old who holds an unrestricted license. Tennessee also requires seatbelts for drivers and all passengers.
