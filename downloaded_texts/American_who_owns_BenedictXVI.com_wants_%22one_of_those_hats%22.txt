Rogers Cadenhead, the American owner of BenedictXVI.com, has made a few requests in his blog. Mr. Cadenhead registered the valuable domain on April 1 along with ClementXV.com, InnocentXIV.com, LeoXIV.com, PaulVII.com and PiusXIII.com; all in anticipation of the recent Papal conclave 2005. 

After Cardinal Ratzinger's election as Pope Benedict XVI, international media swooped on the domain speculating that it may be owned by a pornographer or casino company. However amid the wild speculation, Mr. Cadenhead dismissed these and promised not to sell the domain to any such enterprises.

However today in a humorous manner the prolific computer guide writer posted on his blog a few requests, namely:

* Three days, two nights at the Vatican hotel they built for the conclave
* One of those hats
* Complete absolution, no questions asked, for the third week of March 1987
* A back-cover blurb from the Pope for the next edition of Movable Type 3 Bible Desktop Edition. But only if he uses the book to create his own weblog, and
* World peace.

However he was keen to stress that the requests are not demands and the whole thing was written in a witty humorous manner.
