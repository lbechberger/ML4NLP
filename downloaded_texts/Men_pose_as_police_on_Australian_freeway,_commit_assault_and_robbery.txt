New South Wales police have arrested and charged a man after an attack on the Sydney-Newcastle Freeway (F3) north of Sydney.

Police allege that on March 25, 2006 at around 11:20 p.m., a 22-year-old man was pulled over by three men posing as policemen on the F3 freeway on the New South Wales Central Coast. He was assaulted by one of the men and forced into the passenger seat of his car. During the seven-hour ordeal, he was raped and robbed. His bank card was taken and used to withdraw cash from his bank account. The man was found by a passing driver at Canton Beach, where the group left him after the attack.

On Thursday, a 28-year-old man handed himself in to police at Toukley. He was arrested and questioned by detectives before being charged with robbery in company, aggravated kidnapping, and driving whilst disqualified.

Police are still searching for the other two men involved in the attack.
