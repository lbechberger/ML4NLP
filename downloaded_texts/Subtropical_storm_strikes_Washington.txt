An unnamed subtropical storm known only as "Storm 91C" packing winds of up to 40 mph struck the U.S. state of Washington on Friday. The storm was a very rare occurrence, and caused minimal damage.

It formed from an extratropical storm around October 30 in the Central Pacific and became subtropical on November 1, and was recognized as "Storm 91C" by the U.S. Navy. The storm was out of the National Hurricane Center (NHC) and the Central Pacific Hurricane Center's (CPHC) areas of responsibility, and therefore didn't receive a name. In addition, the CPHC doesn't issue advisories on subtropical storms.

The cyclone moved into the East Pacific and organized into a hurricane-like system with winds up to 60 mph.

The storm began to lose convection and weaken, but managed to make it to Washington and British Columbia as a 40 mph storm with gusts up to 60 mph.

A high wind warning was issued by the National Weather Service for the southern Washington coast to Tillamook.

Heavy rain and high winds were brought along the northern Pacific coast of the United States.
