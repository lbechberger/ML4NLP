I. Lewis "Scooter" Libby, former chief of staff to U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney, pleaded not guilty before the U.S. district judge, Reggie Walton, in Washington's E. Barrett Prettyman Federal Courthouse on Thursday, in response to his indictment regarding the CIA leak scandal. 

"With respect your honor, I plead not guilty," Libby said.

Libby's lawyers addressed reporters following the arraignment. "In pleading not guilty he has declared to the world that he is innocent. He has declared that intends to fight the charges in the indictment, and he has declared that he wants to clear his good name," said attorney Ted Wells. "He wants to clear his good name, and he wants a jury trial," Wells added.

The former vice presidential aide was indicted by Special Prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald last week on two counts of perjury, one count of obstruction of justice, and two counts of making false statements. The indictments focus on whether he attempted to cover up his actions during the investigation instead of whether he illegally leaked the identity of undercover CIA agent Valerie Plame. After being charged, Libby immediately resigned his position.
