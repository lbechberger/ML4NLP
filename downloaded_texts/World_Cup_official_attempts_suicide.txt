Top German FIFA World Cup official Juergen Kiessling was found in his Reinickendorf, Germany (a borough of Berlin) home after a neighbor heard a gunshot. He was rushed to the hospital shortly after midnight with what seems to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head. Two suicide notes were found, one addressed to his daughter, and one addressed to the remainder of his family. The motive for the apparent suicide attempt is not yet clear.

The 65-year-old is listed in serious condition at Virchow Clinical Center in Berlin.
