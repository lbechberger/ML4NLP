Military strongman Voreqe Bainimarama has been reappointed as Fiji's caretaker Prime Minister.

The move comes less than a day after President Josefa Iloilo abrogated the country's constitution in response to a court ruling that the previous military regime was unlawful.

All nine members of the previous interim Cabinet have also been reappointed to their positions.

Bainimarama overthrew the elected government of Prime Minister Laisenia Qarase in a military coup in 2006. He was subsequently appointed interim Prime Minister by President Iloilo. But on Thursday Fiji's Court of Appeal ruled that Qarase's removal and Bainimarama's appointment were unlawful. The court ordered the President to appoint an independent caretaker Prime Minister to dissolve Parliament and call elections.

Iloilo responded by abrogating the constitution, revoking all judicial appointments, and appointing himself head of state.
