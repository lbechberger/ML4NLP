Former U.S. House Majority Leader Tom DeLay indicted by a grand jury on two new charges of money laundering during the Texas redistricting warrant controversy, on Monday, following his indictment by a separate grand jury on criminal conspiracy charges last week. Craig McDonald, director of Texans for Public Justice, said that "for a new grand jury to indict DeLay on a day's notice suggests the evidence of his participation is convincing." DeLay dismissed the charges as partisan, though the veteran prosecutor in the case has indicted three times as many Democrats as Republicans in his career. DeLay faces a maximum sentence of life in prison.
