In a speech before the United Nations General Assembly, Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez called for the UN headquarters to be moved out of the United States.

Chávez cited the Iraq War and the US' alleged disregard for the will of the United Nations as his reasoning for proposing the pullout. He then went on to criticize the proposed UN reforms, saying they were "illegal" as they did not take into account anti-poverty goals set out in a 2000 summit. Proposing sweeping reforms, including the elimination of Security Council members' veto powers, Chávez described the UN as unfit for the 21st century.


In a comment more related to the frosty relationship between the US and Venezuela, Chávez expressed regret that Pat Robertson remained at liberty. Chávez has branded Robertson a terrorist for implying that the US would do well to assassinate the Venezuelan President.

The current summit marks the sixtieth anniversary of the formation of the United Nations, and many world leaders have gathered to work out reforms to the organization to make it more relevant in today's world.
