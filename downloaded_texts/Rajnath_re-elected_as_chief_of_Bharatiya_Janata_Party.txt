Bharatiya Janata Party chief Rajnath Singh has been re-elected as the president of the party for the second time.

Former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and opposition leader Lal Krishna Advani proposed him to retain the post of the party president.

Singh filed his nomination to O.P. Kohli, at the party headquarters in New Delhi. Kohli received other 15 nominations to support Rajnath as party chief.

The former Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister, Singh has been holding the position from December, last year after taking charge from Advani.

New term for singh is expected to follow the saffron brotherhood agenda to tighten the RSS control.
