The 2012 Queensland election has been officially set as Premier Anna Bligh advised Governor Penelope Wensley to issue the writs â€” the formal announcement of the election. 

"Absolutely looking forward to it, the 24th of March," Ms Bligh told reporters, referring to the date of the election.

To lose the ability to govern in its own right, the currently governing Australian Labor Party (ALP) would need to lose sevens seats in Queensland's unicameral legislature.
