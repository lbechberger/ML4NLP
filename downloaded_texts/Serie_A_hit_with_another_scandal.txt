Italian professional sports club Lazio and their coach Delio Rossi have been accused and charged with trying to influence the performance of Lecce in April 2006.

The Italian Football Federation said that Rossi attempted to ask Lazio president Claudio Lotito to contact Lecce officials and discuss their tactics ahead of the match and how their attempt was unsuccessful. Lazio won the match 1-0. Media reports say that the case started because of phone tap evidence.
