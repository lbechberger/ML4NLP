Germany have qualified for Euro 2008 after a 0-0 draw with Republic of Ireland.

It was an evenly contested match with many scoring opportunities. Bastian Schweinsteiger went off with a head injury in the 1st half.

Both teams had their chances until the final whistle was blown. But Germany ended up celebrating as they join co-hosts Austria and Switzerland for Euro 2008.
