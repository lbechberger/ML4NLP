The British National Party(BNP), a far-right political party failed to hold on to one of its seats on Bradford City Council, West Yorkshire, UK. The byelection was called after the incumbent BNP councillor, Angela Clark, stood down. BNP had won the seat in 2004 after it adapted an ongoing campaign against gangs grooming girls for sex. The BNP claimed white girls were being groomed by Asian men for sex. The original campaign was organised by Angela Sinfield, whose 13 year-old daughter was groomed by a gang which she pointed out contained white and Asian men. Sinfield joined the Labour Party last year and was its candidate for the Keighley West seat. She sensationally won the seat with 1819 votes over the BNP's 1216, a swing of 11.4 per cent from the BNP to Labour. The voter turnout was near general election levels, 58.8 per cent.Three BNP councillors remain on Bradford City Council, with two of them up for election in May.
