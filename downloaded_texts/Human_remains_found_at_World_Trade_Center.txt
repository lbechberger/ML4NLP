More bones were discovered on Sunday, October 22 in manholes and utility areas on the site of the World Trade Center. The people are believed to have fallen victim to the September 11, 2001 attacks. 

City and utility officials have already excavated about five underground areas, yielding at least 100 pieces of humanoid remains. Twelve more areas are expected to be excavated.

"They will go through every grain, every piece of material carefully, and sift through it," said Deputy Mayor Ed Skyler, who is overseeing the recovery effort.

Skyler said the city will focus on finding remains before it reviews how the initial search was handled. He said construction at ground zero did not need to be halted to accommodate the search, but that officials would address the need if it arises. Mayor Bloomberg has also stated that construction would not be halted.
