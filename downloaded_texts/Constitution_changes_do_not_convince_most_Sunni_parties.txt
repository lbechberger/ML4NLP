A last minute Constitutional Deal has been struck that brings one Sunni Party into the political mainstream and approval from the US Government. The Iraqi Islamic Party, has decided on Tuesday to support the New Constitution. According to a Party source, "Some of our demands have been met so the Party endorsed the Constitution and urged the people to vote, 'Yes'." Iraq's parliament has moved immediately to ratify the changes just days before the nationwide constitutional referendum on October 15th.

The Bush administration has welcomed the news as a breakthrough; State Department spokesman Adam Ereli has said the Agreement, "Shows, frankly, that the political process in Iraq is working."

Most Sunni political groups have maintained their opposition to the constitution and are urging either a boycott or a "No" vote on Saturday, arguing that the charter could break up the state and hand too much power to Shi'ites and Kurds.
