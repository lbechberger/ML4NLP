In a surprise result, the leader of the Ulster Unionist Party, David Trimble, has lost his seat in the UK general election. Beaten with a margin of over 5,000 votes by his opponent David Simpson of the Democratic Unionist Party, Trimble resigned.

Upper Bann was one of four seats lost by the UUP lost in the 2005 General Election, the others being Lagan Valley, South Antrim, and East Antrim. Its one remaining UK Parliament member is Sylvia Hermon, representing North Down.

David Simpson of the DUP said that his victory in Upper Bann "sends out a very, very clear signal that push-over unionism has gone forever".
