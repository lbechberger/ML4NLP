Prime Minister Tony Blair, in a short statement at midday BST from Gleneagles, Scotland, said that it was his intention to travel to London within a few hours to get a clearer picture of the events, before returning to the G8 summit this evening. Looking visibly shocked, he said that he believed it was "reasonably clear" that it was an act of terror, and that he hoped that the people of Britain could demonstrate that their will to overcome the events is greater than the terrorists' wish to cause destruction. He also said that his determination to "defend" the British way of life outweighed "extremist determination" to destroy it.

He also made it clear that all members of the G8 council wish to continue talks in his absence, he is currently on his way back to London to talk directly to police chiefs and ministers.
