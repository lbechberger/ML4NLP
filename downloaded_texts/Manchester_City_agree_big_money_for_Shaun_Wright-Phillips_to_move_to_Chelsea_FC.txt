Chelsea FC had a bid of £20,000,000 for the England winger rejected on Friday after they finally made their interest in the player official.

Shaun Wright-Phillips had declared on Friday he was happy to stay at Manchester City FC, but 24 hours later he asked City to agree a fee with Chelsea so that he could move to Stamford Bridge.

Both sides have now thrashed out a fee for Wright-Phillips and the flying winger has now been given permission to open talks with Chelsea.

"As a result of Shaun's request to speak to Chelsea we have conducted a series of complex negotiations with Chelsea," City's communications chief, Paul Tyrrell.

"A fee for Shaun's transfer of £21,000,000 has been agreed and consequently we have granted his wish to talk to the other club."

Chelsea are hoping to tie up a deal with Wright-Phillips as soon as possible so that he can join them on their tour of the U.S.A next week.
