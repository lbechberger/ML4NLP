United State president George W. Bush kicked off the 2006 Tee Ball on South Lawn season Friday, June 23, 2006. This is the sixth year of the White House Tee Ball Initiative.
In attendance at the game were General Peter Pace, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who served as the Commissioner of the game, Tim Brant from ABC Sports and WJLA-TV acting as the play-by-play announcer, and seven-year old Zane Ellingwood, who founded "America's Littlest Heroes" last year in his hometown of Cumberland, Maryland.

In his opening remarks, Bush welcomed parents and grandparents to a "historic ballpark." Pitcher Mike O'Connor from the Washington Nationals was at the game as well.
