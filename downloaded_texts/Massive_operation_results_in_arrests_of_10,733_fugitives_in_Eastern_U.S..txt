10,733 fugitive felons have been arrested after Operation Falcon III (Federal and Local Cops Organized Nationally), came to a close after 7 days, U.S. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales and U.S. Marshals Service Director John F. Clark announced on Thursday. The Operation Falcon projects are part of a federally organized effort involving about 3,000 federal, state and local law enforcement officers, who target fugitives with state and local law enforcement warrants, a Justice Department spokesman said.

According to Clark, there are currently at least 1 million fugitives in the United States, and police across the nation arrest about 1,000 fugitives per week.

Gonzales explained that the operation was designed "to be sure that there aren't second or third victims, especially children. . . by a dangerous fugitive". Included in the operation were 24 states east of the Mississippi River, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico.

Amongst the 10,733 fugitives arrested were 1,659 sex offenders, 971 of which were wanted for failing to register. 360 gang members were also apprehended, and over 270 weapons confiscated in the raid. This latest sweep was preceded in April this year, and in April of last year by similar Falcon operations.

No enforcement officers were killed during Falcon III. According to officers, a male murder suspect was killed when he showed a weapon to the police in Atlanta. In Florida, a suspect's mother fired a weapon at police.
