On the same day that Tony Blair resigned as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and quit as a Member of Parliament, he was appointed envoy to the Middle East for the Quartet on the Middle East. The Quartet is made up of the United Nations, the European Union, the United States and Russia.

The Quartet outlined Blair's duties in a statement:


Tony Blair said, in his final address to Parliament on Wednesday, that "The absolute priority is to try to give effect to what is now the consensus across the international community â€” that the only way of bringing stability and peace to the Middle East is a two-state solution," Blair continued, "I believe it is possible to do that but it will require a huge intensity of focus and work."

According to the Quartet statement, "Tony Blair will be supported in this work by a small team of experts, based in Jerusalem." Also, he will "report to and consult regularly with the Quartet and be guided by it as necessary."
