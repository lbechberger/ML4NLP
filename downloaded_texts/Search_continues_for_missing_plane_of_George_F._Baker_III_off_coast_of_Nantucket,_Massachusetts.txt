The United States Coast Guard is currently searching still for the downed Beechcraft twin-engine plane piloted by philanthropist George F. Baker III off the coast of Nantucket, Massachusetts. 

Air-traffic controllers lost radar contact with pilot during the afternoon, even though the pilot has just talked with them moments before. The plane also did not issue a distress signal.

Weather is not believed to be a factor as visibility was above five miles.
