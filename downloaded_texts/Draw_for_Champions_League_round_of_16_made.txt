The draw for the first knockout round of the Champions League proper has been made today at UEFA's headquarters in Switzerland. In perhaps the tie of the round the league leaders of the Premier League and La Liga, Chelsea and Barcelona, have been drawn together.

Here is the complete draw:

Real Madrid v. Juventus 
FC Porto v. Inter Milan 
Barcelona v. Chelsea 
Werder Bremen v. Lyon 
Liverpool v. Bayer Leverkusen 
PSV v. Monaco 
Manchester United v. AC Milan 
Bayern Munich v. Arsenal 

The teams listed first will play their home game first. The first leg matches will be played on February 22/23, with the return games played on March 8/9. The FC Porto-Inter Milan second leg will be played on March 15 due to UEFA rules saying that a stadium cannot be used to host two games on consecutive days; Inter share their San Siro ground with AC Milan
