Two suicide bombers in Ramadi, Iraq have killed 20 people, and injured several others.

According to police, the attack targeted the governor of the Anbar province of western Iraq. Iraqi police said that the attack commenced when a suicide car bomb detonated a car bomb near provincial governor Qassim Mohammed al-Fahdawi's office.

The second bomb exploded when the governor along with other officials arrived to inspect the spot of the first attack. This attack was carried out by a bomber on foot. The deputy police chief died in this incident, while the governor, as well as several others, were injured.

Also, an Iraqi judge and his wife were wounded by gunmen late Tuesday in the city of Kirkuk, northern Iraq.
