Extremely rare and expensive Patek Philippe watches will be presented at the forthcoming Antiquorum auction sale. The Antiquorum's Collectors' Wristwatches, Pocket Watches and Clocks event is to take place on March 28. Over 300 of other timepieces will be sold at the auction.

The participants of the auction sale will have a unique chance to acquire a Patek Philippe Ref. 5029 watch. The brand's limited edition creation is estimated to reach the price of about 500,000 dollars. It is one of just ten timepieces housed in rose-gold cases that were developed in 1997 to pay tribute to the opening of the new company's factory in Geneva. The watch powered by a self-winding movement offers a complicated function of a minute-repeater.

Another highlight of the auction will become an equally rare and high-priced Patek Philippe Ref. 5013 watch. The timepiece is meant to be sold at a price range of $400,000 to $500,000. The platinum timekeeper is equipped with a self-winding movement. Besides providing a minute-repeater function, the complicated tonneau-shaped watch has a retrograde perpetual calendar, moon phase indicator and a 48-hour power reserve.

Patek Philippe Ref. 2499 watch will be the third exquisite creation of the brand. It is expected to be acquired at the range of 300,000 to 400,000 dollars. The astronomic timepiece is housed in 18K yellow gold case. The watch offers the following complicated functions - a round-button chronograph, a perpetual calendar, a 30-minute register and moon phase indicator.

The auction will be organized at Antiquorum's new headquarters located on Madison Avenue, New York City.
