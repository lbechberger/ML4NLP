According to a spokesperson, actor George Clooney, 46, along with his girlfriend Sarah Larson, 28, were injured in a motorcycle accident in New Jersey after the motorcycle was sideswiped by another vehicle.

"George Clooney was involved in a motorcycle accident this afternoon after the bike he was riding was hit by a car. He's doing fine. He has a broken rib, it's very painful and it'll take a long time to heal," said Stan Rosenfield, a spokesman for Clooney in a statement.

Clooney received fractured ribs and road rash whereas Larson broke a foot. Both were treated and released from North Bergen, New Jersey's Palisades Medical Center.

Clooney is still expected to attend the opening of his new film Michael Clayton, which is to take place in New York City, New York on Monday.
