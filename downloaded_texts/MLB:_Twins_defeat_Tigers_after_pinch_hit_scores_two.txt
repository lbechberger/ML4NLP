The Minnesota Twins faced the Detroit Tigers at Comerica Park Friday in a AL Central Division match-up. Twins starting pitcher Ramon Ortiz gave up five hits and two runs in the six innings he pitched. Tigers starter Nate Robertson allowed one run in seven innings, but was charged with the two runners that scored for the Twins in the eighth inning.

The Tigers pounced in the third inning; Carlos Guillen singled scoring the veteran Gary Sheffield. The Tigers would add one in the sixth with a Craig Monroe double, scoring Sean Casey. The Twins would get on the board in the seventh inning, with the lead off hitter Justin Morneau sending his first pitch over the left field fence.

But the Twins would rally with a four-run eighth inning, which started with a Mike Redmond single, driving in two runs to tie the game at 3-3. Joe Mauer, who wasn't scheduled to play, pinch hit in the DH spot and brought in the go-ahead run, plus one, giving the Twins a two-run lead. Joe Nathan picked up the save, his seventh of the season.

The middle game of this three-game series will be played tomorrow at noon in Detroit. Starting for Detroit will be Justin Verlander, and Carlos Silva will start for Minnesota.
