Myanmar opposition leader, Aung San Suu Kyi has left her house arrest to meet with government officials.

Witnesses have observed a caravan of vehicles leaving the home of the 1992 Nobel Peace Prize recipient. Reports say that she is meeting with a liaison minister, U Aung Kyi, who was recently appointed by Senior General Than Shwe, the leader of Myanmar's military junta.

The appointment of a liaison minister came after Special Envoy of the United Nations, Ibrahim Gambari, arrived in Myanmar on an urgent mission to press for mediation and reconciliation.

Yesterday, protests around the world yesterday marked the 12 years that Aung San Suu Kyi has spent in detention or house arrest. She was first arrested in 1989.
