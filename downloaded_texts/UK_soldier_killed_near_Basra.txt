The Ministry of Defence has named the British soldier who died after a mission in the northern area of Basra in Iraq. 

27 year-old Corporal John Johnston Cosby, of the 1st Battalion Devonshire and Dorset Light Infantry, was one of two servicemen who sustained gunshot wounds after coming under fire by suspected terrorists in the Garmat Ali tribal area on Saturday. 

"It is with great regret that we can confirm one of the soldiers has subsequently died of these injuries," said a statement issued by the Ministry of Defence. 

"Our thoughts and sympathies are with the family at this difficult time. The other soldier's injuries are not life-threatening."

Defence Secretary Des Browne said the soldierâ€™s death was "terribly sad". 

"I would like to offer my deepest condolences to their family and friends," he said. "I wish the soldier who was injured a speedy recovery and pay tribute to the bravery of both troops."

Two men suspected of being involved with serious crime and terrorism were detained as a result of the operation. 

According to Major Charlie Burbridge, a British forces spokesman, the intelligence-led operation's objective had been achieved. "We have been pleased with the outcome of the operation - it went according to plan. But we do mourn the loss of one of our soldiers."

So far, 114 British troops have died in Iraq.

Elsewhere in the country today, at least 19 Iraqi civilians were killed and 25 injured in a suicide bomb attack in a crowded cafe. The attack took place in the town of Tuz Khurmatu, which is 50 miles from Kirkuk.
