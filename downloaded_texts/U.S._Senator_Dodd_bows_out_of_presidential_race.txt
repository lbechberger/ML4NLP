United States Senator Christopher Dodd left the Presidential race last night with his head "held high", thanking "the Dodd Squad" and his supporters for their efforts and passion.

Dodd ended the night with the sobering support of just one state delegate's support in the Iowa Democratic caucuses. That was still better than Mike Gravel or Dennis Kucinich, who each received no votes of support. However, neither Gravel or Kucinich conceded, only Dodd and Joe Biden, who won the votes of 23 state delegates, or 1% of the vote.

Dodd's campaign began last year, at the Old State House in Connecticut, the location "where the first written constitution guaranteeing the right to representative government was enacted". 

Dodd admitted that he "always knew" that his campaign would "be an uphill battle against very tough odds." But he rationalized that only "when you try can you truly make a difference. And that, my friends, we did."
