With a very tough defence and an attack of 101 points, the European Champions, Greece, beat the national team of the United States of America with a score 101-95, on the semi-final of the 2006 Fiba World Championship which took place in Saitama, Japan.

The Greek team had a very good day - especially Vassilis Spanoulis and Dimitris Diamantidis - while the zone defence organized by the Greek coach Panayiotis Giannakis blocked the NBA stars who, despite their good performance, will not take part in the final. The best player of the USA team was Denver Nuggets star, Carmello Anthony, who scored 25 points. The other semi-final of the 2006 Fiba World Championship is the game between Argentina and Spain.
