For several weeks, a group of local residents has kept Francesca's Café on 34 Broadway Market, Hackney, East London occupied day and night to prevent its demolition and conversion into luxury flats by property developer Dr Roger Wratten.

The occupation was evicted on 21st December by police and bailiffs, and workmen began a partial demolition, but a new group of supporters re-occupied the building on 26th December and have begun rebuilding it including new walls and a replacement roof.

The café was bought by Dr. Wratten from Hackney Council as part of a number of sales in the street, now surrounded by controversy, and was run by Tony Platia who had worked there for over 30 years. Hundreds of people have attended the café in the past few weeks to show support.
