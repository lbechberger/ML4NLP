A Wikinews analysis of financial reports filed with Elections Canada shows that two of the candidates for the leadership of the Liberal Party of Canada have not made any financial donations to the party, its riding associations, or election candidates in 2005 or 2006. Neither Michael Ignatieff nor Gerard Kennedy are recorded as having made finanical contributions.

Ironically, Ignatieff was the recipient of a donation from one fellow leadership candidate, Martha Hall Findlay, who donated $230.58 to his successful effort to be elected to the House of Commons in the January 23, 2006 federal elections. 

Bob Rae, a former leader of the Ontario New Democratic Party donated a total of $845 to the Liberals since the beginning of 2005 including $300 to MP John Godfrey's election campaign and $300 to Pierre Pettigrew's riding association in Papineau. He also donated money to NDP candidates in the January election including $300 to Irene Mathyssen, who was a cabinet minister under Rae in the 1990s, and $250 to his former special assistant, Rochelle Carnegie, the NDP's candidate in Willowdale. Carnegie's Liberal rival was Jim Peterson, brother of former Ontario premier David Peterson whose government Rae defeated in 1990.

Scott Brison is the most generous Liberal having donated a total of $3175 to the party, its candidates and riding associations, followed by Ken Dryden who donated $2145, Joe Volpe who has donated $1695, Hedy Fry with $1323.49, Hall Findlay with $1290.85, Rae's $845 and Stephane Dion with $595.

Totals do not include donations made by the candidates to their own leadership campaigns. Wikinews examined financial reports for donations to political parties, riding associations and federal election candidates made in 2005 and 2006.
