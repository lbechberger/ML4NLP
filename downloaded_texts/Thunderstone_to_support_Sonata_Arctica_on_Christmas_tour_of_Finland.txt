Thunderstone have joined up with Sonata Arctica as the latter's support act for a four-gig mini tour across the days between Christmas and New Year. Both acts are power metal bands native to Finland, where the tour is being held.

* December 27 - Teatria - Oulu, Finland
* December 29 - Kaapelitehdas - Helsinki, Finland
* December 30 - Metroauto Areena - Tampere, Finland
* December 31 - Jäähalli - Mikkeli, Finland

The gigs in Oulu and Mikkeli will feature Tuple Salminen of Tarot filling the role of lead vocals, while the Helsinki and Tampere concerts will feature original singer Pasi Rantanen, who is leaving the band, for the last time.

Lead guitarist Nino Laurenne made this statement regarding the adition of Thunderstone to Sonata Arctica's tour: "It's great to close one chapter of Thunderstone with these two Christmas gigs and show people that there is no animosity between us. We are looking forward to a bright future with the new members, whoever they turn out to be in the end."

Sonata Arctica are starting the tour in Sweden, but will only be joined by Thunderstone on the four Finnish events. Meanwhile, Thunderstone are finalising preparations for a European tour co-headlining with Nocturnal Rites.
