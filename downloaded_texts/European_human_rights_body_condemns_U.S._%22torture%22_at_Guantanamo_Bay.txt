Lawmakers from 46 European countries meeting in Strasbourg, France asked the Bush administration on Tuesday “to cease torturing and mistreating detainees” at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Europe's 50+-year old human rights body, the Council of Europe, openly condemned the United States Tuesday for using what it termed "torture", and asked European countries not to cooperate in interrogating Guantanamo detainees.

A spokesman for the Pentagon responded that they run "a safe, humane and professional detention operation at Guantanamo."

"The circumstances surrounding detentions by the USA at Guantanamo Bay show unlawfulness on grounds including the torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment of detainees," said the resolution adopted by the Council's Parliamentary Assembly, reported in the Associated Press. The body, confusingly named but not related to the European Parliament, affirmed its support for the United States in the fight against terrorism, but said that the US government "betrayed its own highest principles in the zeal with which it has attempted to pursue the war on terror."

The US government has denied using torture at the base, but human rights council member Boris Oliynik said; "What we see in Guantanamo has nothing to do with justice, the conditions there are medieval."
