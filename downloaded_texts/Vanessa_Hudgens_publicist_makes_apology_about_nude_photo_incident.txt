Controversy erupted on September 6th, 2007 when a nude photo of High School Musical star Vanessa Hudgens appeared on the internet. Hudgen apologised and said she was "embarrassed over the situation" and that she regretted "taking those photos".

Her publicist released a statement saying the photos were taken in private and it was "unfortunate" the pictures were leaked onto the internet. 

Hudgen's role in High School Musical 3 has not changed because of the photos.
