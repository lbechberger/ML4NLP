A bomb in Pakistan has killed at least 40 people and injured several more. The attack took place on the outskirts of Dara Adamkhel, a town which is close to the border with Afghanistan. It has been reported that the bombing may have been a suicide attack, although that has not yet been confirmed.

A Pakistani official at the scene said that "at this point, we [the Pakistani government] have reports of over 40 dead and scores of wounded." The Pakistani Interior Ministry spokesman said that "we [the Interior Ministry] are trying to get information. Initial reports suggest it was suicide attack."

The bomb exploded during a jirga, or tribal meeting, regarding security in the northwestern Pakistani town.

Dara Adamkhel is located about 40 km away from Peshawar, the provincial capital.
