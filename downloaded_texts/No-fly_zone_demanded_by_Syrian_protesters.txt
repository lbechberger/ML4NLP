Friday saw protests across Syria calling for a no-fly zone to be imposed over the nation. The protests are thought to have resulted in around 37 deaths.

At least 170 different protests took place yesterday despite threatened violence as part of the growing unrest in the country. Demonstrators want the country's people to receive international protection against the autocratic rule of President Bashar al-Assad.

Around 37 people are thought to have been killed in a police crackdown against the demonstrations, mostly in the cities of Homs and Hama. According to the UN, more than 3,000 people have been killed since protests began in March.

This wave of protests comes after the deposition of Muammar Gaddafi in nearby Libya, which NATO warplanes played a major part in; Syrian demonstrators want that level of protection to help them.

The level of violence is the highest seen on a Friday - a day of prayers - in six months, according to Agence France-Presse, surpassing the previous high of 36 deaths in May. The worst day in terms of death toll was April 22, when 72 were killed.
