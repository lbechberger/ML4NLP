Three people were killed and a further six were wounded on Wednesday after a building collapsed in the Zamoskvorechiye district of Moscow, Russia.

The building, which was a four-story house located at 71/80 Sadovnicheskaya Naberezhnaya, collapsed at around 16.45 local time after workers had damaged a supporting wall in the basement.

Three people managed to escape from the rubble, and another three were rescued. Three more still remain underneath debris.

A criminal investigation has been prompted after the collapse of the building, with city officials claiming that the building's owner hadn't received permission to redevelop it.

The house was protected under law as an historical landmark. It must now be completely demolished, as well as a neighbouring building, to protect other buildings in the vicinity, announced Vladimir Resin, the City Hall construction chief. Municipal housing will be constructed in the newly vacated lots.
