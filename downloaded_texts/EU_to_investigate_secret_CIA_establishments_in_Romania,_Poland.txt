The European Union, the Council of Europe and the Red Cross said Thursday they will investigate allegations by Human Rights Watch that the CIA has set up secret jails in Romania and Poland.

Mark Garlasco, senior military analyst with Human Rights Watch discovered the secret prisons by examining flight logs of CIA aircraft.

Garlasco, who is a former civilian intelligence officer with the Defense Intelligence Agency, told The Associated Press, "The indications are that prisoners in Afghanistan are being (taken) to facilities in Europe and other countries in the world."
