Sabres lead series 1-0. (Best of Seven)



Brian Campbell and Chris Drury scored two goals each, and the top-seeded Sabres opened the playoffs with an solid 4-1 victory over the New York Islanders before 18,690 at HSBC Arena, in Buffalo, New York. Buffalo goaltender Ryan Miller was very efficient, allowing only one goal in 21 shots. The Islanders backup netminder Wade Dubielewicz filled in for starter Rick DiPietro, who has been bothered by injuries throughout the season.

The game was very defensive for the first half of the game, as both teams were only able to notch a goal a piece. Buffalo scored its first goal 9:30 into regulation, and the Islanders had to wait until 6:58 of the second period, when they evened it up. But the game was pretty much a full onslaught of domination by Buffalo as it dominated the shots category.

The Sabres scored the game-winner shortly after the midway point of the second period, and dealt another quick blow immediately after they returned to the ice for the third period. The Islanders, no doubt, have their problems to work with in terms of injuries, and the frustration could be felt as they drew a penalty late, which would ultimately seal the deal as Brian Campbell would score his second goal with only 3:25 remaining in regulation.

The Eastern Conference series continues at HSBC Arena in Buffalo on Saturday at 7:30 pm EDT, when the Sabres will try to take a 2-0 series lead on the Islanders.
