On Tuesday and Wednesday, two of Fred Thompson pre-campaign staffers resigned. J.T. Mastranadi, who was hired less than two weeks ago as the campaign's director of research, resigned this morning. Whereas, yesterday Thompson's top adviser, Tom Collamore, resigned "because of differences with Thompson's wife, Jeri Kehn, a Naperville native."

While some reports have noted Thompson's success, according to Mark Murray, "Sources close to the presumptive campaign tell NBC News that Fred Thompson's fundraising is down 'markedly.' One claimed it has 'slowed down big-time'."

In the polls, Thompson continues to be a major contender. A July 24th poll by Washington Post-ABC News has: Rudy Giuliani 37%, John McCain 16%, Fred Thompson 15%, and Mitt Romney 8%. While a July 17th poll by FOX News/Opinion Dynamics has: Rudy Giuliani 27%, John McCain 17%, Fred Thompson 17%, and Mitt Romney 10%.
