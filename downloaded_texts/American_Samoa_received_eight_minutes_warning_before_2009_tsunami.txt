People in American Samoa were given only eight minutes warning that a tsunami, which killed 32 people in the unincorporated territory, resulting from the 2009 Samoa earthquake, was approaching. A report published by the United States Congress admits that the warning was issued sixteen minutes after the 8.0 magnitude earthquake struck Samoa. The tsunami killed nearly 200 people in American Samoa, Samoa and Tonga. 

The report, written by the National Research Council, describes the length of time between the earthquake and the initial tsunami warning being issued as "relatively long", and states that the standard time for such a warning to be issued to be around two minutes. The study also revealed that one third of tsunami sensors are not working at any given time.

John Orcutt, a seismologist and head of the committee that wrote the report, described the delay as a "major concern", but he also said that "a large number of people" in American Samoa "didn't understand and there were lives that were lost because people simply didn't take the action to get away from the shore when they felt this huge earthquake. People have to understand the signs of a tsunami and head to higher ground." 

The Federal Emergency Management Agency, whose purpose is to coordinate the response to a disaster that has occurred in the United States and that overwhelms the resources of local and state authorities, and the Government of American Samoa did not respond to e-mails regarding the news.
