California Republican congressman George Radanovich announced Tuesday that he is leaving office in 2010 to spend time with his wife, who is battling ovarian cancer. He has asked that state senator Jeff Denham replace his seat in the state's 19th congressional district, although former congressman Richard Pombo is also considering the position. Radanovich has held the post since 1994 and is a member of the Committee on Energy and Commerce.



Radanovich released a statement: "My family needs me, and I intend to be by their side to win this battle. It is for this reason that I have decided to not seek reelection to Congress in 2010." He said that even when he is out of office he will continue "to fight to unite our valley in helping us get the water we need to save our state's No. 1 industry — agriculture."

Although Radanovich said that he would like Denham to succeed him, Richard Pombo and others are vying for the seat in Congress. "I haven’t made my mind up on it at all, but it is something that I am considering.” Pombo said Tuesday.
