Maffra defeated Leongatha by six goals to take the outright top spot on the Gippsland Football League ladder, ahead of their round eight top of the table Gippsland Football League clash against Traralgon. Traralgon had a bye in round seven.

Goals to Kal Killoran, who's back from interleague, David Adams, Heyden Burgiel, Nicholas Horsford, Samual Bullen, Sam Bedggood, Joshua Stubbe, Daniel Stubbe (2) and Gary Jones (4) sealed the win for Maffra.

Hayden Browne, Clinton Johnston, Matthew Willcocks (2), Tom Marriott (2), Sam Sperling (2) and Dwayne Holt (2) were the goal kickers for Leongatha.
