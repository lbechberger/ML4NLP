A wax model of British singer Amy Winehouse was unveiled on Wednesday at Madame Tussauds in London. The model, nearly six feet tall and clad in a yellow dress with a microphone in hand, is said to bear a strong likeness to the singer. Her tattoos have even been reproduced to the last detail, including one of a lightning bolt.

While her parents attended the event, Winehouse herself was too busy working to attend. Her father Mitch remarked that "This is the reward for her musical achievements and her talent".

The troubled singer, 24, is well known for her drug use, and last month was thought to have been suffering from the early stages of emphysema.
