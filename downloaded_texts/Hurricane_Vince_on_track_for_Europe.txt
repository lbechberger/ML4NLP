This unusual hurricane season, one of the most active in history, has produced another strange storm. Category 1 Hurricane Vince, which was formed from a non-tropical low today, is forecast to head east towards Portugal, rather than west as is usual. Vince caught forecasters by surprise, since the waters in the area are around 25ÂºC. Few expected Vince to even form in the cool waters, much less to become a hurricane.

Forecasters at the National Hurricane Center do not expect Vince to be a hurricane for long. It is forecast to weaken as it moves towards Portugal, and to finally become extratropical. In about 48 hours, they believe Vince will be absorbed by a front in Portugal or Spain.
