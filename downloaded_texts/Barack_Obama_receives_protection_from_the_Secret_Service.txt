Today marked a landmark first for the United States Secret Service. Coming nine months before the first Presidential ballots are cast and eighteen months before the actual election, the Secret Service announced that it would place Democratic Senator of Illinois Barack Obama under protection.

The Washington Post and The New York Times have both reported that although the freshman senator was the one who asked for protection, there was no immediate threat or danger presented that was the cause.

The only other potential presidential candidate currently protected by Secret Service is Senator Hillary Clinton of New York. Senator Clinton is protected because she is a former first lady and wife of former President Bill Clinton.

The Washington Post reports that Michael Chertoff, Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, authorized Obama's Secret Service protection after consultations with the bipartisan congressional advisory committee. Secret Service spokesman Eric Zahren did not provide any extra details concerning the matter, saying, "I'm not aware it was based on any threat."
