The Detroit Red Wings hockey club announced Friday that they had signed a multi-year contract with centre Pavel Datsyuk. The seven year deal is worth US$46.9 million, averaging out to $6.7 million per season.

The 28-year-old Datsyuk is the leading scorer for the Red Wings this season. In 2006-2007, he has accrued 27 goals and 60 assists for 87 points. "Pavel is one of the world's most skilled players and has developed into a bona fide superstar over the past two seasons," Red Wings general manager Ken Holland said in the press release.

Datsyuk, who has been with the Red Wings his entire NHL career, is considered by the Red Wings to be a valuable part of the team's future. "We think securing Pavel, who is moving into the prime of his career, is key to ensuring the long-term success of this franchise," said Holland.

"I am very pleased to announce that I am continuing my hockey career with the Detroit Red Wings by signing a seven-year contract," Datsyuk said. "This contract was extremely important to me. Especially since I have been a Red Wing since 2001." Datsyuk is earning US3.9 million this season in his current contract.

Datsyuk won the Stanley Cup with the Red Wings in his first year with the franchise. In the 2005-2006 season, Datsyuk was awarded the Lady Byng Memorial Trophy, for best sportsmanship and gentlemanly conduct combined with performance in play.
