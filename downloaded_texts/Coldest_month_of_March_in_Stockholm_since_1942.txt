With cold westerly winds from the North Atlantic expected this weekend (March 18-19), Stockholm is likely to record its coldest month of March since 1942, with an average temperature of -6,4°C, and the snowiest March since 1970.

Temperatures are expected to stay over 0°C this week, but past weeks have been very cold, making this month the coldest in many years.

Up to now, snow has covered Stockholm for 78 days in a row, limiting heat absorption from the sun by reflecting sun rays away.

Very low temperatures have been recorded in several areas around the capital, but the average for this winter is far above the winter average of -9,6°C recorded back in 1942.

If any records are to be set for this winter, it’s likely to be the lack of deviations from the long-term winter average. It’s likely to be the most nearly average winter since 1907, thus making it very unusual indeed.

This year will also be the snowiest since the winter of 1969-1970, when snow coverage in Stockholm lasted from November 23 to April 20.

The national meteorological institute SMHI expects the daily average temperature to rise above zero at the end of the month.
