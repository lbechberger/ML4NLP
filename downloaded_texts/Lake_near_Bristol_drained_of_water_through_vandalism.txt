All water has drained out of Marine Lake in Weston-Super-Mare, near Bristol, United Kingdom due to a recent attack by vandals. 


Vandals forced open a sluice gate, and this resulted in all water being drained from the lake. The gate was originally placed there as part of a Â£29m project carried out by North Somerset Council, which says that the project aims to "improve flood defences and regenerate Weston-super-Mare's seafront."

"This is due to a bit of mindless vandalism by people trying to force open one of the sluice gates," said a council spokesperson. "Presumably it was the same yobs who thought it would be fun to splatter mud over the nearby wall."

The council has said it is expected the water level will start to restore at the next high tide and is viewing CCTV footage to locate those responsible.
