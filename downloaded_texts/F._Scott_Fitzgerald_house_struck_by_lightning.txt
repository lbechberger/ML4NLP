During a thunderstorm tonight, lightning set fire to a former home of F. Scott Fitzgerald in St. Paul, Minnesota. Amidst reports about flash flood warnings and floating cars, KSTP TV said that lightning had set the steeple of the F. Scott Fitzgerald house on fire. Fire fighters were working to extinguish the smoky fire, which seemed to be limited to the steeple. Video images suggest the building is the 599 Summit Avenue residence where Fitzgerald wrote This Side of Paradise.
