The arrangements for the funeral of American actress Farrah Fawcett were announced today, after she died last Thursday after a battle with cancer.

The funeral is to be a private one, open only by invitation, held at the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels in Los Angeles at 23:00 UTC (16:00 PDT) on June 30, 2009.

Fawcett's son, Redmond O'Neal, who is currently in jail on a narcotics charge, has been permitted to attend the funeral under a compassionate licence granted by commissioner Jane Godfrey. He will not be wearing his jail uniform, but will be required to be in handcuffs.

Fawcett played Jill Munroe in the 1970s television series Charlie's Angels, which made her internationally famous. During her career, she was nominated for several Golden Globes and Emmys.
