Monday marked St. Patrick's Day, a national holiday in Ireland and a cause for celebration in many other nations.

Australia's Irish pubs were expected to do booming business, while Sydney hosted one of the world's many St. Patrick's Day parades on Sunday.

In the United States, Chicago's main river was coloured green on Saturday.

A memorial to the Flight of the Earls was dedicated at Andermatt, Switzerland to mark the day. Early in the 17th Century, the last of the Gaelic Earls fled Ireland for Spain, travelling through Andermatt during their journey.

St. Patrick's Day parades are conducted in many regions of Japan. The Tokyo parade began in 1992, with this year's edition held on Sunday in the city's OmotesandÅ� neighbourhood. Elsewhere in Asia, Singapore also held a St. Patrick's Day parade, this year connected with the 140th anniverary of the introduction of Guinness beer to that nation.

Finally from Ireland itself, nearly all of that nation's cabinet ministers will be in various nations for promotional visits. Prime Minister Bertie Ahern was in Washington to present a bowl of shamrocks to United States President George W. Bush, among other activities.
