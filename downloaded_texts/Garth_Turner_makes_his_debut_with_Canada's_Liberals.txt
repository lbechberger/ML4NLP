Garth Turner made his question period debut Wednesday in the Canadian House of Commons as a Liberal.


Turner, again, asked the prime minister to put byelections in David Emerson's riding of Vancouver Kingsway and Wajid Khan's Mississaugaâ€”Streetsville. Emerson accepted an offer to join the Conservative Party of Canada after he was elected as a Liberal last January. Khan in January, who was a special advisor to prime minister Stephen Harper for the Middle East and South Asia, also crossed the floor to the Conservatives.

Turner also said he would run again in his riding of Halton if Harper were to call a byelection. He added that he wants an immediate byelection if that were to happen.

"I will assure the member for Halton if he wishes to see a byelection in Halton, it's fully within his control. He can resign today, I'm sure we would comply," said House leader Peter Van Loan.

Turner promised yesterday at the weekly Liberal caucus meeting that he will not reveal secrets nor criticize his new Party.
