Irish news correspondent Rory Carroll was free Thursday night from his Baghdad captors after 36 hours of being held hostage. Carroll was released to Ahmad Chalabi, the deputy prime minister of Iraq, and was put under the protection of the Iraqi government.

"I was treated reasonably well," Carroll said of his captors. He thought that his abduction was done by criminals who were being opportunistic. Their identity is unclear.

The 33-year-old Carroll was on assignment from The Guardian when he was taken from outside a house in the predominantly Shiite area of Sadr City Wednesday.
