The father of British Prime Minister David Cameron died in France today. 77 year-old Ian Cameron suffered a stroke while on holiday. David Cameron travelled to France this morning after hearing the news that his father was ill.

A Downing Street spokesman said that Ian died shortly after the Prime Minister arrived at the hospital. It has been reported that the Prime Minister will stay in France overnight.

Ian Cameron was born with both legs deformed, and during his life he underwent numerous operations. Speaking of his father in March, Cameron told ITV reporter Sir Trevor McDonald "My father is a huge hero figure for me, because he's an amazingly brave man.... To have a disability in the 1930s and 1940s, a different age, was really tough, but he never let it affect him in any way." 

David Cameron missed today's session of Prime Minister's Questions and cancelled his political engagements to travel to France.
