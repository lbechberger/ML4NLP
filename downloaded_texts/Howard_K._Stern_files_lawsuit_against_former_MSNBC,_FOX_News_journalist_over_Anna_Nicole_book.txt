According to court papers, the attorney and partner of now deceased Anna Nicole Smith, Howard K. Stern has filed a lawsuit against a former FOX News Channel and MSNBC news anchor Rita Cosby for "assault, libel and slander." Cosby's publisher Grand Central Publishing, also known as Hachette Book Group USA is also named in the suit.

The papers say that Stern accuses Cosby of publishing "false and defamatory" accusations and information against him in Cosby's new book Blonde Ambition: The Untold Story Behind Anna Nicole Smith's Death.

"The book is an attempt to capitalize financially on the life and tragic death of Anna Nicole Smith. The defendants have exploited Smith's life and death by publishing false and defamatory factual accusations against Stern," said the papers filed in United States District court for the southern district of New York State.

Papers go on to say that Cosby also falsely accused Stern of "lewd criminal acts, homosexual acts, possessing and using cocaine, conspiring to commit murder, pimping and prostitution." There are 14 other additional charges listed in the suit including one that Cosby claimed Stern was having a homosexual love affair with Larry Birkhead, the father of Smith's youngest child.

Stern is seeking at least US$60 million in damages and the suit states that a jury is requested if the case goes to trial.

Cosby's publishing company refuses to comment to the press on the suit.
