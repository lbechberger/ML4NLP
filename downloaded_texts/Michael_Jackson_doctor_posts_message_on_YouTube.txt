Michael Jackson's doctor Conrad Murray has posted a one minute video on entertainment site TMZ — and now YouTube — so that he can reach out to his loved ones because he can't contact them by phone or by e-mail. In the video he has said: "I have told the truth and I have faith that the truth will prevail.

"I want to thank all of my patients and friends who have sent me such kind e-mails, letters and messages to let me know of your support and prayers for me and my family. I haven't been able to thank you personally, which you know is not normal for me. Your messages give me strength and courage and keep me going. They mean the world to me. Please don't worry. As long as I keep God in my heart and you in my life I will be fine."

Law enforcement sources investigating the death of Jackson have claimed that Conrad was to be arrested and charged with manslaughter within the next week. Another source has told Fox News that the former dermatologist of the star is also to face criminal charges. Fox News have also said that investigators had hoped to charge Murray with a more serious crime than manslaughter - second-degree murder.
