A gunman has been killed and a police officer hospitalised following a stand-off in West Yorkshire, England which concluded this morning. The gunman, who, according to police, "continually" fired at officers, sustained serious injuries after police returned fire; he died in hospital.



Police attended a property in Kirkheaton, Huddersfield yesterday, to arrest a man for allegedly threatening a person at a nearby property. Upon their arrival, the man inside fired with a handgun from his doorstep at police, injuring one officer. Armed police then surrounded the building.

Reports suggest the gunman fired on police throughout the stand-off, which involved negotiators. Around 0530 GMT armed police returned fire, seriously injuring the gunman. He was transported to hospital where he later died. "There were three loud bangs—possibly gunfire," a news cameraman said. "Then the police started shouting and I heard them smashing glass as they went into the house. They were shouting at the gunman to show them his hands."



A spokesperson for West Yorkshire Police confirmed the stand-off had come to an end. "The man produced a gun and fired at the officers. A male officer in his 20s was hit and attended hospital for minor injuries," he said. "We regret that the incident at the house did not conclude peacefully as we had hoped and can confirm that the man taken to hospital from the address has now died."

The road remains closed as the investigation continues. Neighbours said they were shocked; one said about eight or nine shots were fired throughout the night. "The police then just told us to stay inside but I could see what was going on opposite," he said. "Loads of police turned up—some carrying machine guns. They lit the house up like a Christmas tree and the armed police were behind hedges." The Independent Police Complaints Commission is to investigate.
