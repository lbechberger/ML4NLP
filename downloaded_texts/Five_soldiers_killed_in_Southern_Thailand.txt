Five soldiers in the southern Thailand province of Narathiwat were killed and another two injured in a drive-by attack by suspected Islamic militants.

The attack occurred whilst the soldiers were eating their evening meal. A representative of the Thai army said that the attackers fired assault rifles at the group before fleeing the scene in a pick-up truck. Metal spikes were strewn on the road to foil pursuit. In addition to the deaths, a number of firearms were stolen prior to the insurgents making their escape.

This was the second incident involving suspected Islamic militants on the day prior to Ramadan. Earlier in the day the decapitated body of a middle-aged man was found at a roadside in Yala Province.

Over one thousand people have been killed in insurgency-related incidents in the predominantly Muslim south of Thailand since 2004.
