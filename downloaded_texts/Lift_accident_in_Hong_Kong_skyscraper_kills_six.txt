Six construction workers at Hong Kong's International Commerce Centre (ICC) were killed on Sunday when they fell seventeen stories down a lift shaft.

The workers were standing on a platform on the 27th floor of the building when it collapsed.

The ICC's building developers from Sun Hung Kail Properties, Ltd., said they would pay the families of the victims at least HK$1 million (US$129,000) apiece and pay for funeral costs. Donald Tsang, the city's CEO, said a full investigation into the incident would be launched.

The International Commerce Centre, when completed, is to be the fourth tallest building in the world, with 118 stories. It is scheduled to open in 2010.
