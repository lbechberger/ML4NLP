North and South Korea today agreed to continue the quest for a peaceful resolution to the ongoing nuclear crisis in North Korea but did not agree on a date for continued talks, delegates from North and South Korea announced.

Issuing a joint statement, South Korean Unification Minister Chung Dong-young said in part, "The South and the North have agreed to take real measures for peaceful resolution of the nuclear issue through dialogue as the atmosphere is created with the ultimate goal of denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula." 

North Korean leader Kim Jong Il said last week that he would consider rejoining negotiations if the United States would give North Korea the respect it deserved as a nation.
