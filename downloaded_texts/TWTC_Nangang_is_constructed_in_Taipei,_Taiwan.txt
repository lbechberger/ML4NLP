Larger and bigger than the Taipei World Trade Center (TWTC), the Taipei World Trade Center Nangang Exhibition Hall (TWTC Nangang) was finally completed on December 24.

According to the hall owner, Taiwan External Trade Development Council (TAITRA), TWTC Nangang owned 2650 booths twice larger than current TWTC (1300 booths), several companies from different industries wanted to exhibit in TWTC Nangang by participating in some international shows, but the competition was apparently intensive because of limitations on booths and scales.

Recently in a press conference, Minister of Economic Affairs of the Republic of China Steve Ruey-long Chen said to media: "After the TWTC Nangang was finished its construction, it will bring on opportunities for companies from different industries including exhibition industry."

TAITRA also announced that some international shows will be moved to Nangang including the Taipei Cycle, Taipei PLAS, TAITRONICS and Food Taipei. COMPUTEX Taipei will exhibit in not only TWTC Nangang but also TWTC Hall 1 &amp; 3, Taipei Show (formerly known as TWTC Hall 2), and the Taipei International Convention Center to challenge the largest scale in June, 2008.

Companies wanted to exhibit in the TWTC Nangang, but due to the construction of Neihu Line of Taipei Metro, it is still in process, and shows with similar industries will be exhibited in the same schedule respectively at TWTC Hall and TWTC Nangang, the traffic will increase on those two exhibition centers after TWTC Nangang will be launched on March, 2008. TAITRA currently considered moving important trade shows to Nangang rather than domestic market shows.
