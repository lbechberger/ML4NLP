The Director-General of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed ElBaradei, has issued a new report titled "Implementation of the NPT Safeguards Agreement in the Islamic Republic of Iran" and distributed it to members of the United Nations Security Council and the Agency's member states, but notes that the report is to remain secret, stating that "unless the IAEA Board of Governors and Security Council decide otherwise, the Agency cannot authorise its release to the public."

Iran is presently neither a member of the UN Security Council nor of the IAEA Board of Governors. 

As of 20:52, 29 April 2006 (UTC) or earlier, the report was made available on the Internet on the website payvand.com, dated April 28, 2006. It is unknown whether or not the release was authorised by the United Nations Security Council or the IAEA.

The report's concluding paragraphs summarise the IAEA's findings: "33. All the nuclear material declared by Iran to the Agency is accounted for. Apart from the small quantities previously reported to the Board, the Agency has found no other undeclared nuclear material in Iran. However, gaps remain in the Agency's knowledge with respect to the scope and content of Iran's centrifuge programme. Because of this, and other gaps in the Agency's knowledge, including the role of the military in Iran's nuclear programme, the Agency is unable to make progress in its efforts to provide assurance about the absence of undeclared nuclear material and activities in Iran. ... 37. The Agency will pursue its investigation of all remaining outstanding issues relevant to Iran's nuclear activities, and the Director General will continue to report as appropriate."
