Britney Spears will not appear on the legendary American children's program Sesame Street.

When contacted today, Sesame Workshop press representative Ray Hammerman replied that the rumours were, "not true, there are no plans to have her on as a guest."

Sesame Workshop Vice President of Corporate Communications Ellen Lewis backed up this statement, adding that the show is "not in production until Feb. 2008".

Published reports in British tabloid newspaper The Daily Star suggested Spears was to improve her image by appearing on the show. She was to perform a "dumbed-down" version of her hit single "Toxic", with Oscar the Grouch, a character that lives in a trash can. "Toxic" was released in 2003.

Spears faces losing complete custody of sons two-year-old Sean Preston and one-year-old Jayden James.

The Daily Star did not respond to Wikinews about their reasoning for the story.

Sesame Street has featured well over 300 celebrity guest stars in its 38 seasons.

The most recent season saw guests Alec Baldwin, Tyra Banks, James Blunt, Miri Ben-Ari, Richard Belzer, Chris Brown, Anderson Cooper, Ann Curry, Ellen DeGeneres, Tina Fey, Charles Gibson, Cuba Gooding, Jr., Mariska Hargitay, Ice T, Matt Lauer, Fred Newman, players of The New York Jets, Howie Mandel, Christopher Meloni, Conan O'Brien, Sarah Jessica Parker, Ahmad RashÄ�d, Rachael Ray, Al Roker, Diane Sawyer, Jon Stewart, Sugarland, Meredith Vieira, and Brian Williams.
