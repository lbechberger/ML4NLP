Gary Neville is likely to face an inquiry from the Football Association as complaints filter in from Liverpool Supporters present at the game. Neville, who had ran the entire length of the pitch celebrating, was alleged to remark inappropriate comments at the fans, after they had taunted him the entire game.

The true nature of these comments, however, is yet to transpire, but due to police intervention, it may be thought they were anfield related, although such claims are unfounded. Despite the fact Neville has not been formally charged, the attacks have, at least prompted police to request the referee's report so they are able to fully start correspondence with the FA.
