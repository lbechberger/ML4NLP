A small plane crash landed in heavy fog on the southeastern part of Nantucket Island near Low Beach Road in Massachusetts between 8:30 p..m. and 8:45 p.m. EDT (UTC-4).

FAA spokesperson Holly Baker said that the pilot who was flying with his wife made a hard landing at Siasconset.

Police cordoned off the area and about a dozen emergency vehicles responded to the incident. Numerous residents reported a loud noise which they mistakenly believed to be an explosion.

The plane involved in the crash had been fitted with a parachute, which is designed to reduce the speed of an emergency landing and limit crash damage. The plane's parachute had been deployed before the crash, according to Lieutenant Jerry Adams of the Nantucket police department.

Both the pilot and his wife were taken to the hospital for observation. Serious injuries were not reported.
