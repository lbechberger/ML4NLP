The controversial blog Liverpool Evil Cabal which had made serious allegations concerning Liverpool City Council and other organisations, is reportedly offline as off August 13th 2006

This blog is temporarily unavailable but the fight goes on.
 

According to BBC News, Merseyside police have apparently been called in and are working with the Crown Prosecution Service. As yet there has been no confirmation that the blog was acting in or had intended to act in a criminal manner.

Liverpool City Council, has so far declined to comment on the sites disappearance, although the site had been previously blocked from the council's IT systems.
