Australian Prime Minister John Howard will face the Cole inquiry into Iraqi kickbacks by wheat exporter AWB on Thursday.

Mr Howard said in a statement that he has been asked to appear at the inquiry. "The Cole Commission of Inquiry has requested that I appear at its hearings" he said.

Mr Howard expects that he will give evidence around 10 a.m. "The Inquiry has indicated that it would suit its convenience for me to do that at 10 a.m. tomorrow" said Mr Howard.

It will be the first time an Australian Prime Minister has appeared before an inquiry since Bob Hawke faced the Hope Inquiry into Australia's intelligence services in 1983.
