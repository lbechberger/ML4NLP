Russian opposition movement "Smena" has published a clandestine video of what it claims is falsification during the Russian elections. The video allegedly shows the election zone no. 730 in Moscow. "Smena" claims a woman is illegally voting on behalf of soldiers as she feeds their voting bulletins into the electronic voting machine, while a man watches. "Smena" presumes both are members of the local electoral commission.

Other allegations include a disproportionate share of absentee ballots used in polling places, voting numerous times by visiting different polling stations, ballot stuffing and machinations involving electronic ballot counting machines, campaigning at polling centers, voter bribery, and ballots in the ballot box before voting began.
