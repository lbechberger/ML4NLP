The 2014 Winter Paralympics officially opened last night in Sochi, Russia. The ceremony was attended by Russian Federation leader Vladmir Putin. 45 nations are competing, including Argentina, Kazakhstan, the United States, Mexico, Armenia, Brazil, Ukraine, and Russia. During the speech about values to be upheld during the Games, sexual orientation was mentioned. There were no direct mentions of the situation in the Crimea region of Ukraine, whose 31-athlete-strong delegation participated in the parade of nations with only their flag bearer. During a press conference earlier yesterday, the Ukrainian Paralympic Committee President said the team had two or three options they were considering for the Opening Ceremony.
