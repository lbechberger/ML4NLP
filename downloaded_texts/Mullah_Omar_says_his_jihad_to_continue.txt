The head of the Taliban, Mullah Omar, has declared that "his same type of jihad" will not cease. Furthermore, the demise of Mullah Dadullah "won't create problems for the Taliban's jihad."

The statement was read to the Associated Press by Yousuf Ahmadi, who claims to speak for the Taliban.

Mullah Omar took on the title Commander of the Faithful in 1996 and was the head of state of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan from 1996 to 2001.

The leadership council of the Taliban has appointed Mullah Bakht Mohammad to replace Mullah Dadullah. Mullah Bakht Mohammad is the younger brother of the deceased Mullah Dadullah.

Yousuf Ahmadi, a spokesman for the Taliban, stated that the Taliban offered condolences to Mullah Dadullah's family and "his mujahedin (holy warriors), the Muslims of Afghanistan and the Muslims of the world." Dadullah has been hailed as a martyr by the Taliban and their followers.
