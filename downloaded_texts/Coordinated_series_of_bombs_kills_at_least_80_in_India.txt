According to police sources, a series of seven coordinated bombs detonated in Jaipur, the capital of the state Rajasthan, in India on Tuesday, May 13. At least eighty people were killed and over two hundred injured in the attacks.

The bombs went off over a period of twenty minutes and tore through the city's crowded bazaars, beginning at 7:20 p.m. IST (UTC+5:30). An eighth bomb, which did not go off, was recovered. Ten of the dead were children.

In the wake of the bombing, a daytime curfew has been in place. "The curfew is a precaution to ensure peace," said Vasundhara Raje, the Chief Minister of Rajasthan.

On Wednesday, two arrests were announced. "We have arrested two people and have detained several more for questioning," said Vasundhara Raje. "This seems to have been done by some international group," she added, in a comment that was intrepreted by The Daily Telegraph to suggest Pakistan-based Islamic militants. 

The President of Pakistan Pervez Musharraf and Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gillani both condemned the Jaipur bombings.
