The man that took a woman and her newborn baby hostage has been arrested by the police. He made no demands, neither has it been confirmed whether he had a gun. Nobody suffered any injuries in the incident. The 32-year-old man was the woman's ex-boyfriend.

He entered the room in the hospital in Eschweiler, Germany, where a woman and her new born child lay. He took them both hostage, no contact was achieved, and his eventual demands are not known. The smell of fuel was reported from the hospital, and part of the hospital was evacuated as police and fire department entered the building.
