Italian Giancarlo Fisichella has won the Australian Formula 1 Grand Prix in Melbourne, the opening Grand Prix of the 2005 season.

Fisichella, driving a Renault, started from pole position leading for the majority of the 57 lap event.

Fellow Renault driver Fernando Alonso finished third, with Ferrari's Rubens Barrichello separating the pair.

It was an unhappy weekend for defending world champion Michael Schumacher, who began from the rear of the field after his qualifying hopes were severely dented by Melbourne's changeable weather. Schumacher made steady progress through the field during the race but retired on lap 43 after a collision with fellow German Nick Heidfeld.

The next grand prix is scheduled for March 13 in Malaysia.
