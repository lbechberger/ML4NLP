Chinese officials have confirmed that a man admitted to a hospital on November 27, died on Sunday from the H5N1 Avian Flu virus.

The man, only being identified as 24-year-old Lu, is from the Jiangsu Province of eastern China and was admitted to the hospital after having severe flu-like symptoms. Lu was originally diagnosed with pneumonia. Tests done on blood samples from Lu confirmed the presence of H5N1.

Officials say that Mr. Lu was never in close contact with dead poultry and there are no reports of any birds being infected in the area and no other reports of human infection.

At least 69 other individuals are being kept at hospitals for observation, after having come in close contact with Mr. Lu, but officials say that none of those individuals are showing any signs of infection.

Lu's death brings the total number of those infected in China by the H5N1 virus to 26, with 17 dying from the virus in China since 2003. This is the first human infection since June of 2007.
