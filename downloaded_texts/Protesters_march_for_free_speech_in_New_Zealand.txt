Yesterday, about 200 Christchurch, New Zealand residents of all ages formed together and marched against a current government bill going through Parliament, the Electoral Finance Bill. The opponents of this Bill share the same common ground that they consider the bill to be severely restrictive of free speech.

"At a time when political parties are free to spend millions and millions of dollars promoting their own views - both from their own money, and taxpayer's money.
