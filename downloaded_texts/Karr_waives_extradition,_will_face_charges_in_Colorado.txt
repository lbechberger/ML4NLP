John Mark Karr, the man who last week admitted to killing six year-old JonBenét Ramsey on Boxing Day 1996, has been told by a judge that he will be sent to Colorado to face charges.

On Monday, the forty-one year-old American teacher was extradited from Bangkok in Thailand to California. From there he will fly to Colorado within the next few days, and it is expected that he will be formally charged with murder, sexual assault and kidnapping.

JonBenét, a beauty queen, was found beaten and strangled to death in her Colorado home on the day after Christmas in 1996.

In a press conference last Wednesday, Karr confessed to being with JonBenét when she died, adding that her death was an accident. "I was with JonBenét when she died. I loved JonBenét. She died accidentally. I am so very sorry for what happened to JonBenét. It's very important for me that everyone knows that I love her very much, that her death was unintentional, that it was an accident."

Despite his confession, Karr's then ex-wife said that he was in Alabama with her when the murder occurred.
