FC Internazionale Milano must wait for the Serie A Scudetto after a 1â€“3 home defeat against AS Roma in the Italian Serie A. The loss is the first Inter have suffered this season, and it came at a very unfortunate time. With a win, Inter could have sealed the league title for themselves, breaking the record for clinched title with most games remaining. The loss, however, means that Inter will attempt to tie the record of five games remaining next Sunday against Siena. 

Roma started well and took the lead after 44 minutes through Simone Perrotta. Inter equalized in the 52th minute when Adriano earned a soft penalty, and Marco Materazzi scored from the spot. In the 88th minute, Roma captain Francesco Totti scored a freekick goal after a deflection off Luis Figo in the wall. Roma sealed the win only a minute later through Marco Cassetti.

Though mathematically Roma could still win the league, the reality of the situation is that Inter will seal the league title easily within the five remaining games. The win does help Roma secure their spot for next seasons Champion's League, however, where they will be hoping to put in a better showing than they did this past season. 

Roma's next match is also on Sunday, as they take on tenth place Atalanta.
