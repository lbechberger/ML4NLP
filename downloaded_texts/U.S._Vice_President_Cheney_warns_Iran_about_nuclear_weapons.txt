Speaking on the aircraft carrier USS John C. Stennis, U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney sent a strong warning to the Iranian leadership. He said that the U.S. would not permit Iran to obtain nuclear weapons. The USS John C. Stennis is currently in Abu Dhabi. The comments are considered more poignant because Iranian leader Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is set to visit Abu Dhabi in the next few days.
