With a Queensland state election coming up in Australia, many minor parties will be looking to hold balance of power and making the major parties listen to what they have to say. Daylight Saving for South East Queensland (DS4SEQ) is one of these parties.

DS4SEQ is a single issue party which, as its name suggests, advocates the implementation of daylight saving in South East Queensland. Currently Queensland runs on Australian Eastern Standard Time (UTC+10).

Queensland's unicameral parliament is due for election in September, but may be held earlier. The election, like all Australian elections, must be held on a Saturday. The election campaign will run for a minimum of twenty six (26) days and a maximum of fifty six following the issue of the writs.

Wikinews held an exclusive interview with the DS4SEQ. Answering on behalf of the party was leader Jason Furze.
