Parts of Scotland, including, Aberdeenshire, Arbroath, Tayside, and Grampian have experienced severe flooding following heavy rains.


Abroath is being described as virtually cut off, with major routes including the main railway
line to Aberdeen disrupted.

A spokesperson for Aberdeenshire council was quoted as saying that "our crews have been working throughout the night providing support to the emergency services, keeping roads clear as best they can and helping with the evacuation of residents.

"The torrential rainfall across a large part of Aberdeenshire has meant that our crews have been stretched very thinly but they have been committed to helping wherever possible.

"Our resources were stretched to the limit. We'd already given out most of our sandbags. Anyone experiencing flood-related difficulties can phone 01224 665400 and we will offer advice, support and assistance." 

Superintendent Innes Walker of Grampian Police said that "people should not take journeys unless absolutely necessary and they should listen to the radio for updates on road conditions.

"The advice we are getting from the Met Office is that conditions improved overnight but clearly there will be a knock on effect for commuters.

"Grampian Police are working with the local authority, Scottish Ambulance Service, Grampian Fire and Rescue and the Coastguard to alleviate the problems and minimise the effects of this flooding on affected people."
