Three Romanian journalists were abducted in Baghdad, Iraq shortly after Romanian President Traian Băsescu visited the country to meet with the Romanian troops deployed there. The journalists went missing Monday, and have been identified as reporter Marie Jeanne Ion, cameraman Sorin Dumitru Miscoci and reporter Ovidiu Ohanesian. Miscoci and Ion were both from the television station Prima TV, which had been in Baghdad for five days to conduct interviews with Prime Minister Iyad Allawi and interim President Ghazi al-Yawer. Ohanesian was an investigative reporter from the Bucharest-based 'România liberă' newspaper, and was scheduled to return to Romania this weekend.

The three journalists were abducted from a street next to the Flowerland Hotel, in the upscale Jadriya neighborhood, where they were staying. A hotel employee stated that the abduction occurred at approximately 20:30 on Monday. Prima TV also confirmed that it lost contact with the crew at 19:45 on Monday, and that Ion and Miscoci were probably kidnapped by a rebel group from Baghdad's al-Mansur district.
