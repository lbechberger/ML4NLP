Pakistani military agreed to help in the rescue mission of Slovenian alpinist TomaÅ¾ Humar. 

Humar was on his paramount course mission on the 4700 meter high south rock wall of the 8125 meter high Nanga Parbat mountain (the utmost west of the mountain chain) in the Himalaya mountains, being trapped in the ice-hole at an approximate height of 5900 meters for five days. The rescue mission with the military helicopter is planned for Monday morning local time, August 8, 2005.

The rescue team managed to locate Humar on face on Sunday, but said they need a better helicopter for the actual rescue mission. Swiss Air Zermatt rescue pilots offered their help in the effort.
