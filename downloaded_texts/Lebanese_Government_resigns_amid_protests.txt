The Lebanese Government has resigned amid a protest by 10,000 people in Martyrs Square. The Syrian-backed government lead by Prime Minister Omar Karami was under pressure in recent weeks, particularly after former Prime Minister Rafik al-Hariri was killed earlier this month.

The protests were demonstrating over Syria's large military presence in Lebanon. Syria has over 14,000 troops in Lebanon.

Announcing his resignation, Karami said, "Out of concern that the government does not become an obstacle to the good of the country, I announce the resignation of the government I had the honour to lead." In response to the governments decision to resign, opposition leader Walid Jumblat said, "The people have won."

The Syrian Government, which backed the government of Mr Karami said that the matter was "an internal affair" for Lebanon.
