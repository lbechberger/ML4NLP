TV star Fern Britton is in talks with producers about appearing on BBC One show Strictly Come Dancing. She was best known for being co-presenter on ITV1's This Morning — and is set to make her TV comeback on the hit show. She has been offered Brendan Cole as her dance partner.

One TV source has mentioned that there are many incentives for Fern to appear on the dancing show, including losing weight and also being offered a whole host of TV and magazine deals. The Strictly Come Dancing production team are keen to attract more viewers on this year's series — especially as the programme will be going head-to-head with the new series of ITV1 hit singing show The X Factor, which appeals specifically to the 16–30 year old viewing market.

The BBC has yet to confirm or deny any contestants on Strictly Come Dancing.
