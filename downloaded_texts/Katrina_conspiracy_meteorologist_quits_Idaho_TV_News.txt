Scott Stevens, the Idaho meteorologist who claimed that a weather manipulating conspiracy (possibly under the control of Japanese Yakuza mafia) caused Hurricane Katrina, has quit his job at KPVI-TV in Pocatello. 

Stevens reportedly quit to pursue his weather conspiracy theories full time. According to KPVI's general manager Bill Fouch, Stevens left his job voluntarily.

Wikinews reported on Stevens' theories on Monday September 19, 2005.
