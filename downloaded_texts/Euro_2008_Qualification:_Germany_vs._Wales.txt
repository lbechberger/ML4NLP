Wales held Germany to a goalless draw in their final match of UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying at the Commerzbank Arena, Frankfurt am Main.

Despite starting strongly, Wales had few chances on goal with Carl Fletcher sending a shot wide of the post. The best opportunities for Germany came when Tim Borowski's attempt hit the post after fourteen minutes and Mario Gomez's header went just wide. However Wales' defence held and the match remained goalless.

The result of this match had no effect on qualification, as the fates of both teams had been sealed beforehand. Germany had already secured qualification from Group D, while Wales could not qualify. Germany finish second in the group, behind the Czech Republic who claimed first place after a 2-0 victory in Cyprus. Wales finished fifth in the group, behind Slovakia and ahead of Cyprus.
