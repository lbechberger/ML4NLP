Portugal's national team defeated the Luxembourgish team by 3-0 yesterday, in Portugal's last game in preparation for the 2006 World Cup. Two goals of Simão and another of Figo resolved the game.

In the first part of the game, Scolari, the head coach of the team, used the same "eleven" players that were used on the Euro 2004. At halftime, Scolari changed Deco, Costinha and Pauleta for Postiga, Petit and Simão.

Simão was important for the win of the Portuguese team. After a few seconds in the game, the Benfica's player scored the first goal of the game. At the 74th minute, Simão, taking a penalty kick as the result of a foul committed against Figo, scored the second goal.

The team’s captain, Figo, scored the last goal in the 84th minute.

The next game of the Portuguese national team will be on June 11 against Angola, already at the 2006 World Cup. In Group D, Portugal and Angola will also face the national teams of Mexico and Iran.
