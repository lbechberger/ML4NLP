Sicilian Mafia boss Salvatore Lo Piccolo, considered to be one of the successors of the former "boss of bosses" Bernardo Provenzano (arrested in April 2006), was arrested at 9:30 a.m. CET (UTC+1) in a villa in Giardinello, between Cinisi and Terrasini on Sicily. He had been on the run since 1983. His son Sandro Lo Piccolo and two other top mafiosi, Gaspare Pulizzi and Andrea Adamo, were arrested as well. All four men were among Italy's top 30 most wanted Mafia suspects, according to police officials.

Police fired several warning shots in the air as they moved in against the mafiosi, who were all armed but apparently did not put a fight. Sandro Lo Piccolo, in tears, shouted "I love you dad!" several times as he was being handcuffed. The four were put into a police helicopter and flown towards Palermo's main police station. At the police station there were scenes of jubilant disorder. As the convoy of police vehicles hurtled towards the entrance, officers wearing face masks gave "V for victory" signs to applause from a crowd outside.

The arrests came on the day that Palermo held a day of memory for all victims of the Mafia. Outside the Palermo police-station a crowd of dozens of curious onlookers began to gather as well as anti-Mafia activists.
