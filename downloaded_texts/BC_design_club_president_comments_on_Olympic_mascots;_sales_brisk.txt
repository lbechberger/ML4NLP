Wikinews recently spoke with Mark Busse, president of the BC Chapter of the Society of Graphic Designers of Canada, to find out what his organization's views are of the 2010 Winter Olympic and Paralympic mascots, Miga, Quatchi, and Sumi.



While the products at HBC stores of the mascots have been flying off the shelves, many have bashed the designs for having "too much" of a Japanese influence. As of 2001, 1.5% of Vancouverites were Japanese heritage, and 29.9% were of Chinese descent. Vancouver's Chinatown is one of the largest historic Chinatowns in North America, and Japan has had diplomatic relations with the city since 1930.

This is the first time the Olympic and Paralympic mascots have been unveiled at the same time.

Busse is also a partner and the design director at Industrial Brand Creative, a design firm in the province. He is co-chair of Graphex '08, a design exhibition at the Emily Carr Institute, which "showcases the best cultural, social and business communications in Canada."
