After a period of weakening on Sunday, Tropical Storm Carlos, formerly a hurricane, has re-strengthened today over the open waters of the Pacific. 

Carlos formed on July 10, and intensified to attain hurricane status on July 11. However, the storm's structure became disorganized over the next day, leading the National Hurricane Center (NHC) to downgrade Carlos to a tropical storm. 

As of 2100 UTC on Monday, the storm had maximum sustained winds of 65 miles per hour with gusts to around 75 mph. Minimum atmospheric pressure associated with the storm was near 994 millibars. The system was centered approximately 1420 miles to the southwest of Baja California.

Carlos is moving to the west-southwest at about 12 mph as it tracks farther out to sea. NHC forecasters currently expect the cyclone to remain at roughly the same intensity for the next few days before beginning to deteriorate.
