Changing conditions have brought moderate east winds to the Houston/Galveston area, raising tide levels across western shores of Galveston Bay. Wind-inflated tides combined with regular high tides are resulting in maximum waters as much as four and a half feet above normal levels. Erosion due to Hurricane Rita has lowered some areas, especially sand dunes, giving an appearance of even higher tides.

The cold front expected to pass the area on Thursday will bring an end to the east winds and tide levels should return to normal.
