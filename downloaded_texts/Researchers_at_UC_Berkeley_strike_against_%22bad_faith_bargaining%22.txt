At University of California, Berkeley on Thursday, researchers and technical workers formed a strike against what they call "bad faith bargaining" within the UC system. The Coalition of University Employees (CUE) labor union estimates that around 10,000 university workers are on strike. Other strikes related to this are occurring at UCSF Medical Center, UC Santa Cruz, and four other UC campuses around the state.

The Coalition of University Employees accuses top UC officials of ignoring the union's requests regarding the high turnover rate of researchers. CUE organizers say the university is misleading the union about the quantity of money readily available for employee salary increases.

The UC officials deny accusations that they have bargained in bad faith, saying they have offered a contract to the researchers that's similar to an approved deal.
