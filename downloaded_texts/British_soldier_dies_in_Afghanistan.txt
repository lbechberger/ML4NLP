The Ministry of Defence has confirmed tonight that a British soldier has been killed in Afghanistan. Twenty-five year-old Private Leigh Reeves, from the Royal Logistic Corps in Kabul, died in a traffic accident in Camp Souter.

His commanding officer praised Private Reeves, saying he was a "high calibre soldier" and "one of those larger than life characters" that every unit needed. 

He is the fifth UK soldier to die this month in Afghanistan, and in total, eighteen British troops have died there since operations began. 

Last Sunday, Private Andrew Barrie Cutts, from the Royal Logistics Corps, was killed by insurgents in the northern area of Helmand Province.
