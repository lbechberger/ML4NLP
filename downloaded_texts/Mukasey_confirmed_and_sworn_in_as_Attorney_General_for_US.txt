On Friday, Michael Mukasey was confirmed by the United States Senate as the next Attorney General, succeeding Alberto Gonzales. Mukasey took the oath of office with his family attending in a private ceremony that was administered by Assistant Attorney General Lee Lofthus.

The nomination of Mukasey, by President George W. Bush, hit a rough spot over the issue of interrogations, in particular about waterboarding. "This man has been a judge for 18 years,â€� said Senator Dianne Feinstein, who along with Senator Chuck Schumer provided the essential votes to pass Mukasey through the Senate Judiciary Committee. "Maybe he likes to consider the facts before he makes a decision."

"I am not going to aid and abet the confirmation contortions of this administration," said Senator Patrick Leahy, who voted against Mukasey, in both the Committee and the Senate votes.

In a statement released by the White House, President Bush said: "I thank the Senate for its bipartisan vote confirming Judge Michael Mukasey as the Nation's 81st Attorney General. Judge Mukasey is a man of strong character and integrity, with exceptional legal judgment."
