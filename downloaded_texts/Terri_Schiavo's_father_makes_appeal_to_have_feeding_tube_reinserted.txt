Terri Schiavo's father made a last-minute appeal to have his daughter's feeding tube reinserted Friday.

"Terri is weakening. She's down to her last hours," said Bob Schindler, Schiavo's father. "Something has to be done and done quick."

Bob Schindler and his wife Mary filed an emergency appeal Friday to have a feeding tube reinserted in their 41-year-old daughter. Earlier Friday, U.S. District Judge James Whittemore rejected the family's previous appeal. On Wednesday, he rejected a similar request.

The new appeal will be filed in the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta, although that court has twice before rejected the family's appeal.

The tube was removed on Friday, March 18, 2005.
