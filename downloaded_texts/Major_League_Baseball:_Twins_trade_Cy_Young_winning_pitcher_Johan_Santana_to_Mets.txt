In a deal announced Tuesday, the Minnesota Twins have traded pitcher Johan Santana to the New York Mets. The trade is yet to be finalized, pending a physical examination and agreement on a contract extension, but an agreement is expected to be made before 5:00 EST Friday.

In exchange for the three-time all-star and two-time Cy Young award winner, the Twins would receive outfielder Carlos GÃ³mez, and three right-handed pitchers, Philip Humber, Deolis Guerra, and Kevin Mulvey.

Santana is reportedly looking for a 6 to 7 year deal worth around US$150 million, and has been on the trading block for some months now. This trade comes just days after the Twins signed multi-year contracts to two of their other stars, Michael Cuddyer and Justin Morneau. Cuddyer signed a three-year, $24 million deal, and Morneau was given $80 million over six years.

Santana has a 93-44 in his 6 season career with the Twins, recording over 235 strikeouts per season the past 3 seasons. He is one of 14 players to have won the Cy Young more than once, in 2004 and 2006, and he was a MLB All-Star in 2005, 2006, and 2007.
