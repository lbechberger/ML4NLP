Reporters Without Borders held a demonstration today at the Grand Mosque in Paris in support of Jill Carroll calling for her release. Present were Mosque rector Dalil Boubakeur with five French ex-hostages: Florence Aubenas, Roger Auque, Jean-Jacques Le Garrec, Roland Madura and Ivan Cerieix. 

Carroll was kidnapped in January when insurgents ambushed her car and killed her translator. She is 28 years old. The abductors gave a 72 hour dead line; that is due to expire this evening, and are expected to kill her if their demands are not met.
