Former Vice President of the United States, Dick Cheney, said that "I think 2010 will be a phenomenal year for the conservative cause and I think Barack Obama is a one-term president," at the 2010 Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC). Other speakers at the conference included the newly elected Senator Scott Brown, the former Attorney General John Ashcroft, and former presidential candidate Mitt Romney.

Cheney's daughter Liz introduced her father to the gathering. Then the crowd began cheering 'Run, Cheney, Run' and when someone in the crowd said 'Cheney 2012' he replied 'knock it off' jokingly. "A welcome like that is almost enough to make me want to run for office again," he said, "But I'm not a-gonna do it."

Cheney has consistently denied that he will seek the presidency in 2012, although there has been a large movement within the Tea Party to write in his name on the Republican Primary.

He concluded his speech with "There comes a time when those of us in our generation need to move on, I want to encourage that younger generation...it's a remarkable time to be an American, a remarkable time to be a conservative."
