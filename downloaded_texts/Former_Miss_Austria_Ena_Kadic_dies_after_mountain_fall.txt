Ena Kadić, an Austrian woman who won the 2013 Miss Austria crown, died early this week in hospital. She was 26 and fell whilst jogging in the Austrian Alps on Friday.

Kadić fell roughly 30m down the Bergisel mountain in Tyrol, near Innsbruck where she worked. She was taken to Innsbruck University Hospital with injuries to her head, pelvis, and lung. Remaining conscious after the fall, she had alerted her family via telephone who in turn contacted emergency services.

She was found near the Drachenfelsen platform, which overlooks the River Sill. Police said she knew the area and enjoyed running; a profile on the Miss Austria website said she was into sports and nature.

The brown-haired, green-eyed beauty's looks took her to compete in Bali, Indonesia in 2013. Thereafter she shunned publicity and worked in a fashion store. "The media, the events, the parties — that life made me so unhappy," she said this year in a Seitenblicke interview.
