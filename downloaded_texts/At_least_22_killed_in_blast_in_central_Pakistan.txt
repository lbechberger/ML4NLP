"There are many people trapped in the rubble after the powerful blast demolished some 10 shops [â€¦] The rescue work is under way and we fear the toll may go up," he said, blaming the attacks on terrorists. "It was a terrorist activity, similar to those being carried out in other parts of the country." he added.
