A Florida homeowner Ronald Langley, currently faces surgery in an effort to save his eye after being shot in the face by masked assailants.

Around 9 p.m on Halloween night the Jacksonville resident answered a knock on his door carrying with him (as is traditional) a bowl of candy. Instead of finding trick-or-treaters, the 67-year-old found three camouflage-wearing masked men, one of the three shot him in the face, hitting the homeowner above the eye. Langley was transported to Shands-Jacksonville Medical Center in Jacksonville, Florida.

"This is a very nice neighborhood the neighbors are very close," said Pat Weyer, a neighbor. "It's just a very strange happening." "He had surgery last night and they may do more," Weyer said. "He definitely will lose the sight in his eye, but they are trying to save the eye itself."

"Outside of Halloween night, that would have aroused suspicion. But they blended very well in the crowd of people," said the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office spokesman Ken Jefferson. "A person should not have to open his door and get shot when you've got legitimate reasons to open your door at night."

Police are asking anyone with information about the shooting to call Crimestoppers at 866-845-TIPS.
