United States Senator Ted Kennedy, a Democrat from Massachusetts, was rushed to Cape Cod Hospital from the Kennedy Compound, after reportedly suffering stroke-like symptoms. After two hours in the emergency room, he was flown to Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts. 


Doctors later concluded he had suffered two seizures, one at his home in Hyannis Port, and another en route to Massachusetts General Hospital from Cape Cod Hospital. It was reported that Kennedy was conscious and with family as doctors worked to determine the cause of the seizures.
