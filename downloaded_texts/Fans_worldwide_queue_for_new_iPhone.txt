Fans throughout the world have been queuing up outside stores for the release of Apple's new iPhone, titled the iPhone 3GS. The phone went on sale on Friday morning around the world. According to CNN, around 300 people were queuing outside Apple's New York store while employees were briefed inside.

Lines however, were not as long as was anticipated, with surplus metal barriers outside stores. An Apple employee was quoted as saying that the lines were shorter than this time last year.

The new iPhone contains a faster processor, a digital compass and a video camera. Ever since the launch of the original iPhone two years ago, it has been praised for "making smartphones cool", with over 17 million handsets being sold.

However, critics have said that the new update deals are too costly. The telecommunications company O2 has made owners of Apple's current iPhone products buy out their contracts should they wish to purchase the new phone.
