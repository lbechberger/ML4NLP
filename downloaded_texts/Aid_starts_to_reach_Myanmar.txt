Aid has started to reach Myanmar after a recent cyclone in the region killed thousands. This is despite complaints that the government of the country is not allowing aid agencies full access.

Large companies, including Google, have tried to encourage people to donate to aid agencies. On its website, Google wrote, "join the recovery efforts mobilizing around the world to assist cyclone victims in Myanmar. Your donation to either of these organizations will help survivors of the cyclone and other natural disasters rebuild their communities, and their lives."

Government officials in Myanmar have said that 22,464 people have been confirmed dead from Cyclone Nargis.

Only once the rescue workers reached the most hard hit areas of the storm did they begin to realize the damage that had taken place. At least 10,000 people died in one town alone, Bogalay in the Pyapon District of Myanmar.

Hundreds of thousands are homeless and another three thousand have been injured by the storm. Drinking water is contaminated and food is becoming scarce as the United Nations (U.N.) and other organizations try to get supplies to the region.
