Chelsea Clinton, the daughter of Bill Clinton, U.S. President from 1993 to 2001, has announced that she is engaged to her long-term boyfriend. The 29-year-old announced her engagement to Marc Mezvinsky to friends via e-mail. Mezvinsky is the son of Ed and Marjorie Mezvinsky who both served in the United States Congress. 

Last summer false rumours circulated that the couple had already secretly married. Ms. Clinton's mother, Hillary Clinton, was forced to deny those rumors. Ms. Clinton is currently attending Columbia Universityâ€™s Mailman School of Public Health.
