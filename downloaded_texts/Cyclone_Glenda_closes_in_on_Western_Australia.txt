The Australian Bureau of Meteorology has reported the occurrence of 100 Kilometres per hour (62 miles per hour) winds along the Pilbara Coast as Tropical Cyclone Glenda closes in.

At 8 p.m. WST Wednesday (1200 UTC), the Bureau of Meteorology reported that Glenda had weakened and reclassified it as a category 4 storm. The Bureau of Meteorology expects Glenda will cross the coast between Exmouth and Karratha tonight.

The Bureau of Meteorology predicts gale force winds gusting up to 130 kilometres per hour (80 miles per hour) to develop in the affected region during the day. They predict that later, as the cyclone nears the coast that winds up to 250 kilometres an hour (155 miles per hour) will occur near the cyclone centre.

The bureau also warns of the possibility of a dangerous storm surge between Karatha and Onslow as the cyclone crosses the coast.They warn that tides are likely to rise above the normal high tide make causing flooding and damaging waves.
