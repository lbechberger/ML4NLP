Central Michigan University senior quarterback Dan LeFevour has become the all-time leader in passing yardage in Mid-American Conference history. 

LeFevour broke the MAC career record by reaching a total of 12,000 yards as his team won a 35â€“3 victory over Ball State University Wednesday night. He surpassed the record of Byron Leftwich, who had achieved a total of 11,993 passing yards during his career at Marshall University from 1999 to 2002. LeFevour has also achieved MAC career records for passing yards, total offense (14,861 yards), completions (1,083), and attempts (1,628), and ranks third in touchdown passes (96).

LeFevour has also been named a finalist for the Johnny Unitas Golden Arm Award, which is awarded to the top quarterback in college football. Thaddeus Lewis from Duke University, Colt McCoy from University of Texas, Zac Robinson from Oklahoma State University, and Tim Tebow from University of Florida were also selected to be finalists from a previous list of ten candidates. The award will be given on December 11 at the Tremont Grand Meeting &amp; Banquet Facility in Baltimore.
