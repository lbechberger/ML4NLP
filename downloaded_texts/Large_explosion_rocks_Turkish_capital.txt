A large explosion, now confirmed to have been a bomb, shook Ankara, Turkey, killing at least 6 people and injuring at least 80. The explosion happened in the middle of a shopping district in the Turkish capital during the rush hour, while many people were out shopping.

At first, the explosion was believed to be an accident, but officials later explained that it may have been caused by a bomb, either triggered by a remote-controlled device or a suicide bomber. There was widespread damage to the area; several buildings had their windows blown out.

"This is the most horrific scene I have ever seen. It gives me great grief," Mayor Melih Gokcek said.

"We have seen a vicious, ruthless terror attack at Ankara's busiest time," Prime Minister Recep Tayyip ErdoÄŸan told reporters. "Is it a suicide bomber or a parcel bomb? Technical teams are working on this."
