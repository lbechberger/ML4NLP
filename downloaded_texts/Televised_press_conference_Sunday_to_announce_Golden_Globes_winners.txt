This weekend's 65th Golden Globe Awards ceremonies in Los Angeles are the latest victim of the ongoing labour strike by American entertainment writers. On Sunday, the awards will be presented during a news conference at the Hilton hotel in Beverly Hills, California instead of the traditional annual televised event. The broadcast will include interview clips of the celebrities.

The Golden Globe Awards are conducted by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association (HFPA) and honour television and motion picture achievements. They are a prelude to next month's Academy Awards whose ceremony and telecast are also in jeopardy if the strike continues. HFPA President Jorge Camara expressed disappointment that a full Golden Globe awards presentation would not proceed this year.

Members of the Writers Guild of America walked off the job in November. The HFPA unsuccessfully attempted to negotiate a deal with the union to allow writers to work on the Golden Globe event.
