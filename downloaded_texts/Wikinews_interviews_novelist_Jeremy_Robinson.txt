Wikinews held an exclusive interview with Jeremy Robinson, the bestselling American author from Massachusetts who wrote the thrillers The Didymus Contingency, Raising the Past and Antarktos Rising.

Before deciding to take up the writing of fiction, Robinson was an artist and moviemaker. He says of his years before getting published, "I lived well under the poverty line.....so I could write."

Although his first book, The Didymus Contingency, was self-published, the following two were released through a small press. Recently, he signed a three book deal with St. Martin's Press, a major publisher. He said that he was "pretty excited" about this.

Robinson is currently at work on two other novels.
