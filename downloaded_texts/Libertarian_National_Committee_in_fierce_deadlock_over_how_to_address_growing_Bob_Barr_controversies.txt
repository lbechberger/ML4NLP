The Libertarian National Committee (LNC) was reported to be in a deadlock Sunday night over how to address the growing controversies surrounding their party's U.S. presidential nominee, former congressman Bob Barr.

Many libertarians have spoken out against Barr since his last minute refusal to attend former Republican presidential hopeful Congressman Ron Paul's third party unity conference at the National Press Club in Washington, DC on Wednesday.

The effort to replace Barr as the nominee has been rejected. Not a single person on the 17-member LNC was willing to make the motion.

However, at-large representative Dr. Mary Ruwart — who lost the Libertarian Party's presidential nomination to Barr at the National Convention in May by only a few votes — is supporting a resolution to apologize to Paul. 

This is being countered by Treasurer Aaron Starr, who favors a resolution to chastise Paul for not endorsing Bob Barr and “splitting the Freedom Movement.”

Currently, neither resolution has enough votes to pass.
