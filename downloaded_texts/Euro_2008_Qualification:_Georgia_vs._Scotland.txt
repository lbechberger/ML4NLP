Scotland were defeated 2-0 by Georgia in Group B of UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying.

Seventeen-year-old Levan Mchedlidze, in his second match for Georgia, gave the home side the lead after 16 minutes with a header. Scotland could not convert any of their opportunities, and Georgia sealed the victory in the 64th minute with a goal from David Siradze. 

Georgia are already eliminated from qualification and lie sixth in Group B. Scotland are second in the group, behind France and one point ahead of world champions Italy. However Italy have a game in hand over Scotland, who may need to beat Italy in their final match to qualify.
