Sophie Lavers, a 24-year-old woman from Canberra, has been crowned Miss World Australia in Sydney. She defeated nineteen other finalists to take the prize and will represent Australia at the Miss World event in South Africa.

The entrants were judged based on several categories including best talent, healthy body image, sports and fitness and beauty with a purpose. An aspiring actress, she is completing an acting course and hopes to build a career in film and television. She is also a qualified fitness instructor and has worked as a Kings Cross waitress.

She has been described in the media as having an "amazing figure" and it has been rumoured that she has used this for modelling work. However, Lavers has said that her body has only been modelled for a good cause: "Some do think that, but I have only ever modelled for charity."

She also doubts much will change for her, at least in the near future. "I'll still get up and probably have peanut butter on toast for breakfast but after that I'm not sure what's happening. I guess I won't be going to work tomorrow."

She explained that all the girls who entered were dedicated to making a difference. "I just think it's like having little angels out there through the country helping in all different areas whether it's with children, or blind people, or the homeless." Lavers also complained that non-stop smiling for the event has left here mouth sore. "I'm not used to smiling for hours on end."

Lavers is now set to head to Johannesburg for the December 12 global competition. "I've got to get a month of outfits ready and get a talent and another speech and everything. Oh goodness."
