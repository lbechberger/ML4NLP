Two Taiwanese political parties of the independence-leaning "pan-green alliance" unveiled new bills today in response to the new "anti-secession" law passed earlier this week by the People's Republic of China.

The Democratic Progressive Party is expected to introduce a bill giving the President of the Republic of China the power to take "non-peaceful" action, or other actions, to "safeguard Taiwan's sovereignty and territory". The draft version of the law mandates that the Taiwanese President must report to the legislature on any such actions within thirty days.

DPP caucus whip Peter Lin said that although the signatures of only thirty lawmakers are required to make the law valid, over fifty have already been gathered.

The seven-article draft law states that the Taiwan issue is not a part of China's internal affairs, but rather that it is an international matter between nations. It goes on to state that it is necessary and urgent to quickly enact counter-legislation to deter Mainland China's annexation efforts. It further calls for increased trust and understanding between the two sides, including greater trade, sporting, and cultural links.

The Taiwanese Solidarity Union also proposed a new "anti-annexation" law. The eleven article draft states that "Taiwan is already an independent sovereign state and it is not an issue for Taiwan to declare independence or seek separation from China". It goes on to state that the government should call a referendum to amend the Taiwanese constitution to safeguard Taiwanese sovereignty. The draft law would also give the Taiwanese President authorisation to resort to "non-peaceful means" to resist Chinese aggression.

Taiwanese independence has been a thorny issue in recent years, as some Taiwanese politicians insist that the democratic island is a sovereign nation, and Chinese authorities insist that it is a part of the PRC.
