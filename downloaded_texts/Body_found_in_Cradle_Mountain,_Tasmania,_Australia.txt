A body found in the Cradle Mountain national park on the 2nd of August has yet to be recovered because of rough weather in the winter months. A recovery begun on Thursday the 2 August was discontinued because of unfavourable weather conditions. 

It is assumed that the body is that of Kasper Sorensen, who went missing on the 5th of July while trying to hike up to the summit. The body was found in an area already searched by rescuers for the tourist, but the area was previously covered in thick snow with heavy storms.
Mr Sorensen was a Danish tourist backpacking around Australia as part of a half year round the world holiday.

Inspector Brian Edmonds from the Tasmanian Police said to ABC Radio, that when retrieved the body will have to be formally identified by the coroner, but the method of identification will depend on the coroner's decision.
