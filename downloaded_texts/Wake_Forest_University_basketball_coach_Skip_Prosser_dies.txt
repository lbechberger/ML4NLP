Wake Forest University men's basketball coach Skip Prosser died Thursday morning, after collapsing while jogging on campus in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, in the United States. 

Prosser was taken to Wake Forest University Baptist Medical Center, where he later died. The collapse was reported to be a result of a heart attack. He was 56 years old.

Prosser started coaching at Wake Forest in 2001. During his first four seasons, he led the Demon Deacons to the National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament; however, his team missed out during the past two seasons.

Before coming to Wake Forest, Prosser coached at Xavier for seven years. He had a 126-68 record at Wake Forest and an overall record of 291-146.

He is survived by his wife Nancy, and his two sons.
