The communist FARC guerrilla named Omaira Rojas, or Nayibe Rojas Cabrera, or Nayibe Rojas Valderrama, or Sonia was extradited to the United States. The Colombian President Alvaro Uribe Velez authorized the extradition requested by a tribunal court in Washington.

The guerrilla was given to DEA officers Wednesday, March 9, at 3:25 p.m. in the airport of Barranquilla, Colombia.

Colombian and American authorities say that Sonia directly negotiates the delivery of narcotics to drug dealers from Peru and Brazil.

Sonia's lawyers said she could not be extradited to the United States since her real name was not determinated. They demanded a revision to the process. The government of Colombia didn't accept the arguments and Uribe signed the authorization for the extradition.
