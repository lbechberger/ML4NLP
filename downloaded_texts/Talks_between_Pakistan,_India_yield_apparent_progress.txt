Diplomats from Pakistan and India met today in Islamabad to discuss their continuing peace efforts. Plans were made for Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf and Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to meet in New York on September 14. 

The president and prime minister are expected to attend the United Nations General Assembly during their meetup in New York. Discussion on other items on the New York agenda occurred today and will continue tomorrow in a second day of talks.

Recent talks have also been met with the announcement that an agreement between the two countries regarding missile tests would be signed in October. Although Pakistan and India have informally agreed to inform each other about their missile testing activities, they now seek a formal agreement.

The Asian countries began seeking peace in 2003 after fighting two wars over control of Kashmir.

When Musharraf and Singh met last in April, they called their peace process "irreversible." However, this statement is challenged by continued terrorist activity in Kashmir.
