Ferrari driver Kimi Räikkönen won the FIA Formula One 2009 ING Belgian Grand Prix at the Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps, Spa, Belgium.

Kimi qualified 6th, but jumped to second after a multiple crash in the first corner involving Jenson Button (Brawn) and Lewis Hamilton (McLaren) collided with the rookies Romain Grosjean and Jaime Alguersuari and all four drivers were out of the race. When the pace car turned off the lights and the race restarted Kimi overtook the pole-sitter Giancarlo Fisichella in Eau Rouge, who drove his Force India to the second place.

Sebastian Vettel finished third for Red Bull, while his teammate Mark Webber was ninth after a drive-through penalty for unsafe release from pit-stop. BMW Sauber Robert Kubica and Nick Heidfeld placed 4th and 5th respectively.

Rubens Barrichello finished after Hamilton's teammate Heikki Kovalainen. Nico Rosberg closed the top eight for Williams.

Jenson Button did not score any points but still leads the championships with 72. Rubens Barrichello earned 2 points and is within 16 of Button. Sebastian Vettel is now only 3 points behind Barrichello and Mark Webber still has 51.5 points. Brawn GP tops Constructors' standings with 128 points. Red Bull Racing is 23.5 points behind with other far behind.
