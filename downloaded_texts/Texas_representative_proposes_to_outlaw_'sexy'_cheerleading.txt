Houston, Texas representative Al Edwards proposed a bill last week to ban "sexually suggestive" cheerleading in Texas high schools, middle schools, and elementary schools.

The movements typical to cheerleading are sexual, said Edwards, and send out the wrong message, especially as youth should be encouraged to be more reserved where sex is concerned. The penalty for schools that continue to allow the activity would be a cut in state funding.

Edwards filed the bill after witnessing several performances in his district.

Several others agree with Edwardsâ€™ proposal.

"Anything that promotes family-oriented behaviour is a good thing," said Rhonda Roberts, a director for the United Spirit Association.

"I don't think this law would really shake the industry at all. In fact, it would give parents a better feeling, mostly dads and boyfriends, too," said J.M. Farias, who owns Austin Cheer Factory. He pointed out that cheering competitions frown on the movements in question.

Cheerleading is a recreational activity and sometimes competitive sport involving organised routines including elements of dance and gymnastics, to encourage crowds to cheer on sports teams. It is a popular activity practised by millions of American students. In Texas, there are competitions that start at the age of four.
