South Korean scientists have confirmed that they have completed the first ever commercial cloning of a dog to take place.

Bernann McKinney, who ordered the cloning for US$50,000, has said that she is pleased with the result of the cloning. "They are perfectly the same as their daddy. I am in heaven here. I am a happy person," she said in a press conference delivered earlier today. The regular charge will be up to US$150,000, but was discounted for the first customer.

McKinney continued the press conference by saying that "Booger [the dog] had a kindness in his heart and I believe that kindness is something that can be, I don't want to use the word reproduced, but the best way Dr Lee explained it is we can give him his body, you are going to give him the love and environment to recreate the original Booger's personality."

McKinney ordered five copies of her dog Booger, which she describes as her 'partner' and 'friend'.

RNL Bio, which performed the cloning said that "we commemorate the world's first commercial cloning of a pet dog, Booger," on their website. They also stated that anyone interested in getting their pet cloned should contact them.
