Iran has warned Israel that an invasion of its country will be met with strong defense. The response follows a report by the The London Times that the Israeli military was prepared to strike Iranian nuclear facilities and the order to strike could come within days.

"Iran's military mechanism is comprised of both defensive and deterrent plans. The truth is that Iranian armed forces are perfectly capable to trounce invaders in the event of an onslaught against the country," said Ahmad Reza Pourdastan, the commander of Iran's ground force to Hamshahri, an Iranian newspaper.

On April 18, The Times quoted unnamed Israeli defense officials as saying "if its forces were given the green light they could strike at Iran in a matter of days, even hours." The Times goes on to quote the official as saying that Israeli forces are "making preparations on every level for this eventuality." Israeli forces are awaiting for the final go ahead order from the newly formed government.

The Times states that Israel will launch an air assault, initially bombing over a dozen targets which would include all known Iranian nuclear facilities such as Natanz, Iran's largest nuclear facility.

The talk of possible war between the two nations came just before Iran's scheduled military parade on Saturday. The parade was to show the public the latest military equipment for its naval, ground and air forces.
