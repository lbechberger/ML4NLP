At the recently held 22nd ICANN International Conference in Mar del Plata, Argentina, the ICANN (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers), officially designated three new top level domain names: .jobs and .travel and .eu.

Tralliance will operate the new .travel domain and Employ Media will operate the .jobs. domain. Registration will start in a couple of months. Prices have yet to been determined.

.jobs was created for the use of personnel businesses, .travel for the travel industry, and .eu will be used by organizations based in the European Union.

ICANN has also entered into negotiations with registries for .cat, .post and .mobi domains.

The ICANN, established by the U.S. Department of Commerce in 1998, is a non-profit corporation responsible for the technical coordination of the Internet through the assignment of domain names and IP addresses.
