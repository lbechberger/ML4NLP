According to the United States Geological Survey, an earthquake of magnitude 4.7 struck at 07:18:11 UTC (08:18:11 local time) in Kent located in the United Kingdom. However, the British Geological Survey reports the quake at a magnitude of 4.3, and Sky News reports that the quake had a magnitude of 5.0.

The epicenter was located 25 km [15 miles] south of Canterbury and was at a depth of 10 km [6.2 miles].

The earthquake occurred close to the entrance of the Channel Tunnel at Folkestone, although there are no reports of damage to the tunnel. A spokesman for Eurostar, the high-speed train service running through the undersea tunnel, said the quake has had no effect on their services. 

Kent Fire and Rescue Service claimed to have received calls from residents who say electricity and telephones are out of service. Some residents report cracks in homes and collapsed chimneys. Residents have been evacuated from their homes and businesses, and officials have shut off some natural gas and electric supplies as a precaution.

"We have had calls from people saying their chimneys have fallen down, large cracks in people's houses," said a spokesman for the Kent Fire and Rescue Services, but The Daily Star reports that the quake caused "widespread damage" to homes and businesses.

It has been reported that at least one person has required hospital treatment.
