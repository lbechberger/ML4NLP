Two elderly women whose CCTV pictures were shown in newspapers across the UK on Thursday after they were caught on camera stealing a bag at a railway station in Sunderland have turned themselves in.

The police has announced that women admitted the offence and have received an official caution in a case variously dubbed the "Grey Train Robbery" and "Gran Larceny."

The women contacted police services after the case received major newspaper and media coverage under headlines such as "Nans on the Run" and "Artful Codgers."

A security camera image released by police showed two grey-haired women, in their 60s or 70s, wearing knee-length skirts, white blouses and overcoats at Sunderland station.

Police had appealed for help in finding the women after a student's bag was stolen from a station platform.

"They handed themselves in," police announced in a statement. "They subsequently were interviewed and admitted the offence. Both received police cautions."
