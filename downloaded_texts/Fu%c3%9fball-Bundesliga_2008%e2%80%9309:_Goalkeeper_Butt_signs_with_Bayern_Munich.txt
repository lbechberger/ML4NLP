Bayern Munich have signed former Germany International Goalkeeper Hans-Jörg Butt to a 2 year contract. Butt played in Portugal last season for Benfica. The deal means Bayern Munich have successfully completed their search for a new back-up goalkeeper for new Number One Goalkeeper Michael Rensing.

Bayern chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge said, "We’re very pleased with this transfer, as Hans-Jörg Butt’s international experience fits our requirements exactly." Rummenigge went on to further say, "We want Hans-Jörg Butt to support the development of our young goalkeeper Michael Rensing, and he’s looking forward to this task at Bayern Munich."

Hans-Jörg Butt contested the 2001-02 Champions League final with Bayer Leverkusen where they fell 2-1 to Real Madrid.
