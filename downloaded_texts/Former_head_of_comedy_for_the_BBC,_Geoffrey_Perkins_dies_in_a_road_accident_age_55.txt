He later left BBC radio to work as a director for Hat Trick Productions, an independent television and radio production company. He left in 1995 to become the head of comedy for the BBC. He left the BBC after 6 years in 2001 to join another independent production company, Tiger Aspect.

Jana Bennett, the director of vision for the BBC said that she was "shocked and deeply saddened" by the news. She also said that "Geoffrey Perkins was an outstanding creator of countless comedy hits on the BBC and elsewhere, and a very distinguished former BBC head of comedy. He embraced comedy talent to create unique programmes which will be enjoyed for a very long time to come. All of our thoughts are with Geoffrey's family at this very sad time."
