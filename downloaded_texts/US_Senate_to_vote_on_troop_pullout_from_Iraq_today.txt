United States Senate Democratic Majority Leader from Nevada Harry Reid has asked that the senate vote on the Levin/Reed Amendment at 11:00 a.m. (eastern time), which would begin a pullout of some U.S. troops from Iraq in 120 days, if the amendment is passed.

Currently, the U.S. senate is pulling an all-night debate on the Iraq war to decide whether troops should be pulled out of the country.

Despite the all-night session, some senators say that the debate is nothing more than a publicity stunt.

"Our enemies aren't threatened by talk-a-thons, and our troops deserve better than publicity stunts," said Mitch McConnell, a Republican Senator from Kentucky.

"We have no alternative except to keep them in session to explain their obstruction," added Reid.

Democrats are calling for a "simple majority vote" of at least 51 in order for the amendment to go forward, while Republicans want at least 60 votes.
