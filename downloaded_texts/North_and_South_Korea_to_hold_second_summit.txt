Korean government announced the second summit between the two divided Koreas will be held on Aug. 28. For the summit, Roh, president of South Korea will visit the North Korean capital for three days.

North Korea's state-run Korean Central News Agency also announced at the same time that the two Koreas are to hold a preparing meeting of the summit in the North Korean border city of Kaesong. 

The two countries last held the first summit in June 2000, when Mr. Kim met then South Korean President Kim Dae-Jung in Pyongyang. The two nations remain technically at war because their 1950s conflict ended only in a truce. This summit is expected to make an end of the state of the war.
