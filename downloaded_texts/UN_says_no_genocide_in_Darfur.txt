A report released by the United Nations last week said that there is no genocide in Sudan's western region of Darfur. 

The report also says that the Sudanese government and its Arab militias had committed crimes against humanity by destroying villages and torturing, killing and raping civilians. According to the report, there is credible evidence that local rebel groups, including the Sudanese Liberation Army, are responsible for serious violations of international law which may amount to war crimes.

The government of the United States and aid agencies say genocide is been committed in Sudan.
