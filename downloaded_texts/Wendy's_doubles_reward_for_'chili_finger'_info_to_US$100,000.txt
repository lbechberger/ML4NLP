After a promising lead from Pahrump, Nevada failed to identify the owner of the notorious "chili finger", Wendy's doubled their reward on Friday to US$100,000.

Sandy Allman recently lost a finger in Pahrump, when a leopard bit it off. Allman's finger was last seen at a Las Vegas hospital. Coincidentally, Anna Ayala, the woman who found the 'chili finger', also lives in Las Vegas. However, when Allman's prints were sent to San Jose police, they didn't match.

"There is no connection," Sheriff Tony Demeo told the San Jose Mercury News.
