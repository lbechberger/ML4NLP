A military transport helicopter carrying a crew of four and ten injured earthquake survivors has crashed in China, it was reported by state news agency Xinhua. There are no indications on what casualties if any occurred as a result.

The helicopter was carrying the injured out of Li county, after having brought in disease control experts. The rotorcraft then lost contact with Air Traffic Control. A search and rescue operation has been ordered by President Hu Jintao.

The day before, the death toll from the disaster was confirmed to have reached 68,977 with another 17,974 missing. Engineers are now working to drain a number of lakes formed by the earthquake, amid fears they could flood. The crash was reported to highlight ongoing difficulties responding to the quake.
