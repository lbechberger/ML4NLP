Talks between Iranian, Russian, French, and United States officials are "off to a good start" according to Mohamed ElBaradei, head of the United Nations' nuclear watchdog.

The four countries met at the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) today in Vienna, despite a statement on Iranian television shortly beforehand saying that the government would not deal directly with France, due to it previously failing to provide "nuclear materials".

The countries are working on a deal which would allow Iran to send enriched uranium to France and Russia and converted for use in a medical isotopes research reactor. This is the first time that a deal has been worked on regarding Iran's nuclear programme since the issue was brought up at a meeting in Geneva at the start of this month.

One concern is that Iran has not sent its atomic agency chief, an indication that a resolution of the matter may be be achieved; nevertheless ElBaradei remained positive. "We had this afternoon quite a constructive meeting. We're off to a good start. Most of the technical issues have been discussed," he said following the meeting. The head of the Iranian delegation, Ali Asghar Soltanieh, agreed with with the comments, but declined to comment on Iranian media reports that the government is reluctant to send its nuclear fuel. Talks are due to resume tomorrow morning.
