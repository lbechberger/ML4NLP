In the United States, a stabbing at the Lincoln-Sudbury Regional High School in Sudbury, Massachusetts has left a 15-year old student dead.

The stabbing happened around 7:20 am EST, before classes had started. A fight broke out in a boys' bathroom between the 15-year old victim, James Alenson and 16-year-old suspect John Odgren, the fight spilled out in the hallway, where the stabbing occurred.

The school was sent into a "lockdown" and students were ushered into the gym, cafeteria and various classrooms. Alenson was rushed to Emerson Hospital where he was pronounced dead at 8:15 am EST. Odgren admitted to the stabbing and was in the principal's office saying "I did it, I did it," to police. However, Odgren also reportedly said "Is he OK? I don't want him to die," according to a police report.
All students were released at 10:20 am EST.

Odgren was diagnosed with severe Asperger's syndrome, an autistic spectrum disorder has been on medication for years, was a special education student at the school and had no history of violence according to his lawyer, Jonathan Shapiro. He is being charged with "murder, assault and battery with a dangerous weapon, and carrying a knife onto school property" and was arraigned in Framingham District Court where he pleaded not guilty to the charges.

Shapiro also asked if his client could go to secure facility at Children's Hospital in Boston. Judge Paul Healy denied the request saying he did not have "enough assurance that Children's Hospital would be secure." Instead, he will be held at Middlesex Jail in Cambridge outside of the general population.

According to the school's website, there will be a community meeting tonight in the school's auditorium at 7pm EST.
