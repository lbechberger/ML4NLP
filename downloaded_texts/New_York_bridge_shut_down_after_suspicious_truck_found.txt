New York Police Department spokesperson Paul Browne said that New York City's Triborough Bridge was shut down after a U-Haul truck with Arizona state license plates was found abandoned. 

The truck reportedly smelled of gasoline according to the toll booth operator. Officials reported that the police department's bomb squad investigated the vehicle. There was no report of a bomb, says Reuters.

Police say witnesses reported seeing a man fleeing from the vehicle on Wednesday night.

This comes just days after the bomb scare in Times Square.
