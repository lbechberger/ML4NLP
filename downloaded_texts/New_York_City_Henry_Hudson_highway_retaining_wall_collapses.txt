Part of a stone retaining wall supporting the Henry Hudson Parkway in New York City near 181st Street collapsed Thursday at 20:00 UTC. The parkway was closed in both directions.

The wall supported the outdoor backyard of the Castle Village co-op, and was nearly 100 years old.

According to New York City Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, no-one was injured, and there was no vehicular or pedestrian traffic at the time of the collapse. Several parked cars were buried under rubble and debris, which spilled out across Riverside Drive where it merges with the northbound lanes of the parkway and onto the parkway itself. 

The mayor said that cleanup of the wall will begin next week.
