Former Thai prime minister Yingluck Shinawatra has begun her trial in Bangkok on Tuesday for alleged negligence in a rice subsidy scheme. If convicted she could face up to ten years in jail.

The subsidy scheme was designed to prop up rice prices by spending billions of dollars to acquire the crop at high rates over the market rates.

It has been alleged by her political opponents that this was a way to gain support from poor rice farmers.

"I am confident that I am innocent and I hope the court will give me justice and allow everything to proceed in accordance with the law," Shinawatra told reporters outside the Bangkok courthouse.

12 months ago the former prime minister was removed from office by a military coup after weeks of protests in the Thai capital. The military stating that it had to restore order.

The court has forbidden Shinawatra to leave the country.
