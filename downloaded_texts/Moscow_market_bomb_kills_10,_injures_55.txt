A home-made bomb containing more than 1kg (2.2 US lbs) of TNT exploded at Moscow's Cherkizovsky market. As of August 22, 2006, ten deaths had been confirmed, including that of six Chinese and one Vietnamese. Two children were also among the blast victims. At least fifty-five more were injured in the attack. Yuri Syomin, the head of the City Prosecutor's Office, says that he "does not rule out a terrorist attack on the eastern Moscow market".

Around 10:30 AM, Vietnamese and Chinese traders heard the explosion. The blast is believed to have originated at Atlantida, a Vietnamese cafe in the Novaya Yevrazia district. Three or four Slavic men left a bag in the cafe, then ran through the doors. As security guards went in pursuit of them, the explosive detonated. 

The Russian news agency Itar-Tass reports that three men have been detained in connection with the attacks, while other sources report that only two men have been taken into custody on the charge of murder in the context of racism. Alexei Grigoryev, deputy head of the City Prosecutor's Office, however said, "currently, only witnesses are being brought in for questioning".
