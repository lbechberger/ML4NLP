The UK Audit Commission has delivered a report that questions the reappointment of Mike Storey, the former leader of Liverpool City Council. It also brings into question the conduct of his replacement as leader, Warren Bradley.

This follows a report from KPMG, which the council has refused to release. Earlier in 2006 the council was the subject of a series of reports from alleged council insiders via a blog. These allegations have surfaced again on several other blogs.
