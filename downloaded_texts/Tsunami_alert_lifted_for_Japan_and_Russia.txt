The tsunami alert issued for certain areas of Russia and Japan after an 8.1 magnitude earthquake struck near the north coast of Japan have been lifted. While the tsunami alert has been lifted, Japan's Meteorological Agency's web site is still showing watches in affect for most of the eastern Pacific coast of Hokkaido.

A small 40cm (15.7 inches) wave did wash up in some areas of the eastern coast of Japan, but this was nowhere near the 200cm (6.5 feet) wave that had been feared.
