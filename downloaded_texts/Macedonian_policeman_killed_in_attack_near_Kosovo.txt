A Macedonian police officer was killed and two were wounded in an attack with automatic rifles on their patrol vehicle near the border with Kosovo, the breakaway province of Serbia. The ambush occurred yesterday, not far from the village of TanuÅ¡evci, a scene of bitter ethnic clashes in 2001.

The Kosovo police chief Veton Ellshani said that he cannot confirm that the attackers entered Macedonia from Kosovo.
