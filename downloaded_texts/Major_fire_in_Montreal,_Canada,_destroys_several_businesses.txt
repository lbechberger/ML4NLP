Fire ravaged several businesses in Montreal, Canada on Monday evening, despite the efforts of over 150 firefighters to extinguish the flames. The alert reached the so-called "five-alarm" stage, drawing in many firefighters, and it took over twelve hours to extinguish the fire.

The fire is suspected to have broken out around 7:00 p.m. EDT (UTC-4) at "Fruits &amp; Passion," a personal care and ambiance products shop, on Saint-Denis street south of Rachel street. Later it spread to the Continental bistro and the L'Barouf bar. The Continental's roof has collapsed due to the fire-induced damage.

Ten firefighters suffered minor injuries, including at least four suffering from a heat stroke, whose condition is said to be stable.

Saint-Denis street was closed between Marie-Anne and Duluth streets during the fire itself, and again the next morning for the demolition of 2nd and 3rd stories.
