Three people are dead after five "brothers" attacked employees at the Bible publishing firm Zirve Publishing House in Malatya, Turkey. Two of the victims were Turkish and the other was German.

The employees had their throats slashed and were tied up at the hands and ankles according to police.

Later after the attack, four men were arrested. One was being treated for serious wounds when he attempted to jump out of a window when police went to chase him. All of the alleged killers are between 19 and 20 years old.

According to police, the "five brothers" carried a letter saying "We are going to our deaths."

"[I condemn the attacks] in the strongest terms.[We will] do everything to clear up this crime completely and bring those responsible to justice," said Frank-Walter Steinmeier, the German Foreign Minister.

"This is savagery," said Recep Tayyip ErdoÄŸan, the Turkish Prime Minister.

Protests were taking place at the firm recently after the firm was accused of "proselytizing" a Muslim nation, but it is not known if the murders are related to the protests.

The names of the victims or suspects have not been released.
