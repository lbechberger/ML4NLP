A man was sentenced to three years probation after he and his mother argued about "American Idol," a popular TV show in the U.S.

Cory Favreau hit his mother with a novelty bike chain in May after she expressed praise for last year's runner-up Katherine McPhee. She was treated for a cut on her head and was released, police say.

Favreau, a twenty-five-year-old native of Plattsburgh, New York, pleaded guilty to third-degree assault. He also pleaded guilty to a contempt charge for violating a court order to stay away from his mother.
