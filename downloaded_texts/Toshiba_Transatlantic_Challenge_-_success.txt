British Toshiba Transatlantic Challenge pilot, David Hempleman-Adams, successfully crossed the and in doing so broke 5 world records. His helium gas balloon landed safely in the French countryside on Friday evening.

The explorer is known for the grueling challenges he undertakes. Having created the "Adventurers' Grand Slam" in which he visited both geographical and magnetic poles and climbed the highest peaks in each of the seven continents, this is his latest undertaking.

Monday saw Hempleman-Adams leave Newfoundland in his balloon. The successful crossing netted him the record for distance travelled in that size of balloon, although he battled with sleep deprivation in the latter stages of the journey.
