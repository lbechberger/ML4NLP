ESPN recently named the basketball rivalry between Calvin College and Hope College fourth greatest across all divisions of the NCAA, although fans had a different perspective. Now when the rivalry makes its way to Holland, the teams will have a new facility in which to square off.

Hope College has put the finishing touches on the new 102,000 sq ft Richard and Helen DeVos Fieldhouse, whose foundation contributed the $7.5 million anchor gift. Designed by sports architectural firm Ellerbe Becket, the fieldhouse will hold about 3,400 fans for basketball, volleyball and will also be used as a venue for college and community events.

The state of the art facility will also house Hope’s department of kinesiology which includes athletic training, exercise science and physical education. In addition to the construction of the fieldhouse, Hope added a new science center in 2003 and renovated the Peale Science Center for ’04-05.

Ellerbe Becket has designed nearly 20 arenas for NBA and NHL teams, including the new facility for the Charlotte Bobcats.

Calvin visits Hope Saturday, 14 January 2006, and hosts the Flying Dutchman 8 February 2006.
