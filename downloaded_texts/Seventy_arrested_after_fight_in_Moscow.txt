Around two hundred people got involved in a mass fight in central Moscow yesterday. Fists and baseball bats were used in a quarrel over land property between employees of two firms. At one point, a few concrete blocks and bricks flew.

Russian firm Real-Impex (Реал-Импекс) owns property in Granatny Pereulok (Гранатный Переулок), that was due for some time to be transferred to another firm. However, the deal was broken in yet unknown circumstances. The fight arose as a way to settle scores.

Five people were hospitalized for injuries. ITAR-TASS reports that 68 people were arrested, questioned and allowed to go home.
