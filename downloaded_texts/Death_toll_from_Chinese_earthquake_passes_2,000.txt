The death toll from a 6.9 magnitude earthquake in the Qinghai province in western China has surpassed two thousand.

The official number of dead is now at 2,039, with another 195 missing. 12,135 people were injured by the temblor, over 1,400 of which were said to be in serious condition. The quake's epicentre was in the Yushu county. On Tuesday, rescuers were still searching for survivors buried beneath the rubble of collapsed buildings in and around the town of Jiegu, one of the most badly affected places.

Officials have increased their relief efforts, bringing food, blankets, tents, and other assistance to the area.

Yesterday, an official remembrance day for those killed was held; public entertainment was limited and national Chinese flags flew at half-mast.
