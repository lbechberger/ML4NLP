India defeated Pakistan by five runs in the final of the 2007 ICC World Twenty20 at Wanderers Stadium, Johannesburg, South Africa.

Gautam Gambhir scored 75 runs as India were limited to 157-5 after twenty overs. The other Indian batsmen fell cheaply, with Rohit Sharma the second highest scorer, reaching 30 not out. Yusuf Pathan was the first to fall, dismissed by Mohammad Asif for 15 runs. Robin Uthappa fell for just eight runs while Yuvraj Singh made 14 before being caught and bowled by Umar Gul, who was Pakistan's best performing bowler, taking 3-28. Gul also bowled Mahendra Singh Dhoni, who made six runs.

Pakistan suffered an early blow when Mohammad Hafeez was dismissed in the first over, and Kamran Akmal fell for a duck soon afterwards. Misbah-ul-Haq top scored with 43 runs as Pakistan neared the Indian total, but wickets fell too quickly as R P Singh took 3-26 and Irfan Pathan took 3-16 to set up a tense finish. Pakistan were bowled out in the final over, five runs short of India.
