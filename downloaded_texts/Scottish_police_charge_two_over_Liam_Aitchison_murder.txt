The Northern Constabulary have charged two men, aged 21 and 20, in relation to the murder of Liam Aitchison in Stornoway, located in the Western Isles of Scotland.

The Northern Constabulary stated that a report will be sent to the Procurator Fiscal. The 21-year-old is currently being retained in custody. Speaking of their "heartbreak" at the news of his death, Aitchison's family have asked those with any information relating to this matter to inform the police.

Aitchison was last sighted on Anderson Road in Stornoway at approximately 2100 UTC on November 22. His body was found in an abandoned building in Steinish one week later.

Aitchison's death was the first to prompt a murder inquiry on the island of Lewis for more than forty years. Detective Chief Inspector Kenny Anderson had previously spoken of the "very positive" reaction provided by the residents of Stornoway when Aitchison's family appealed for assistance.
