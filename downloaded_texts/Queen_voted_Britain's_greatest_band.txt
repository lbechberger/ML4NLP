British rock band Queen have been voted Britain's greatest band by BBC Radio 2 listeners.

More than 20,000 people voted for the band, which was one of five finalists selected by listeners over the previous week. DJ Mark Goodier then hosted a three-hour live show on New Year's day to discuss the five contenders.

Votes were cast via email, text and phone, with Queen up against The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, Take That and Oasis. It was then revealed live on air that Queen were the winners, with The Beatles just 400 votes behind.
