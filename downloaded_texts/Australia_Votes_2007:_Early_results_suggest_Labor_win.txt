Early results in the Australian federal election held today show that the opposition Labor Party led by Kevin Rudd looks set to take government. Such a result would end 11 years under the leadership of the Liberal/National coalition led by John Howard.

Early results indicate a 5.25 percent swing to Labor, with 12 percent of the vote counted. If the pattern is continued through the night, Labor could end up with a ten seat majority in the Australian House of Representatives allowing Mr Rudd to form government.

Mr Howard may also face an uphill battle to hold onto his Sydney seat of Bennelong, with Labor recruit Maxine McKew 47.3 percent of the primary vote to Mr Howard's 42.7 percent.
