A new song by the British rock band The Rolling Stones titled "Sweet Neo Con" has been stirring a controversy over its lyrics, which are highly critical of the Bush administration.

"You call yourself a Christian, I call you a hypocrite" is among the verses in "Sweet Neo Con", according to the Magazine Newsweek. Lead singer Mick Jagger commented on the song, saying "It is certainly very critical of certain policies of the administration, but so what! Lots of people are critical." Jagger, however, denies the criticism is directed at Bush.

The song is scheduled for release September 5 on a CD entitled "A Bigger Bang". Jagger told music critic Jude Cole of ExtraTV, "You can't make rock records without a lot of vitality." 

The band is scheduled to start a tour in the United States, starting in Boston, Massachusetts on August 21.
