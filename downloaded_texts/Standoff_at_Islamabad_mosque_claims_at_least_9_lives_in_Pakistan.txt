Nine people, including two police, were killed, and dozens injured, in fighting earlier today outside an Islamabad mosque between armed protesters and security forces.

There is a standoff at Lal Masjid (Red Mosque) in Islamabad, Pakistan. Hard-line clerics have kidnapped alleged prostitutes and police in their efforts to impose a Taliban-style version of Islamic law in the capital.

"We ask them to surrender and lay down their arms. No action will be taken against those who do it, but if anyone displays weapons and comes out (of the mosque) he will be answered with bullets," Interior Minister Zafar Warriach said.
