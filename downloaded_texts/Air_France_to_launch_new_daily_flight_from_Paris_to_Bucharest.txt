Air France has announced that it plans to launch its fifth daily flight on the Paris-Bucharest route on June 6. Air France currently flies from Paris (Charles de Gaulle) to Bucharest (Henri Coandă) and back four times a day, under a codesharing agreement with TAROM, Romania's largest airline. 

The extra flight is to be operated with an Airbus 318 aircraft, which has a capacity of 94 passengers.

Air France will also adjust its Paris-Bucharest timetable so that possibilities for transfer at Paris Charles de Gaulle airport can be maximised. This would enable passengers flying from Bucharest to Paris to connect to destinations such as Singapore, Hong Kong, Tokyo or Buenos Aires with very little waiting time. 

The fifth daily flight is also to be run under a codesharing agreement with TAROM — the two carriers have decided to allow the transfer of tickets between them.
