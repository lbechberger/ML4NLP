Investigators in Ukraine believe that they have found the skull of journalist Georgiy Gongadze who was kidnapped and found decapitated in 2000. Skull fragments were found near Kiev.

The discovery comes after , who was apprehended last week, told officials his involvement with the case was "direct." At the time, Security Service of Ukraine officials said that Pukach offered to show them the location of Gongadze's head.

Prosecutors filed charges against Pukach on Friday. They believe that Gongadze was killed because of his articles, which incriminated then-President Leonid Kuchma in corruption.
