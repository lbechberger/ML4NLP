The main library in Bristol, United Kingdom may be partially reopened on Monday after being closed for over a week due to a fire.

Most of the ground floor of the library will reopen, although the first floor will remain closed. 

Bristol City Council reported last week that it was possible the library would reopen on Tuesday, although after the inspection on that day, it was decided it would remain closed.

The head of Library services at Bristol City Council commented on the fire last week. She said "we [the Library service] apologise to our customers for this inconvenience but it is not possible to open the library as there remains problem's with power to parts of the building and there is a need to give contractors clear access to clean smoke damage in some public areas. We will review the situation again on Monday morning and issue further updates when further information is available."
