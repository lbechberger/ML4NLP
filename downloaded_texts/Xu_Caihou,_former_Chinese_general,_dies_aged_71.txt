Xu Caihou, a former Chinese general who was once the second in command within the People's Liberation Army, died yesterday , according to Chinese state news agency Xinhua. Xu, 71, was due to be prosecuted over bribery charges. The cause of death was announced as bladder cancer. 

In 2012 Xu resigned from the executive committee of the Communist Party. In 2013 he retired from the position of Central Military Commission Vice Chairman. In June last year, despite no charges announced against Xu at the time, his general's rank was revoked.

The government said they started investigating Xu last March over claims of corruption and in October he admitted to accepting "massive" bribes as payment in assisting people to gain promotions. Due to his death the charges against him are to be dropped but anything gained illegally by Xu is to be dealt with under Chinese law.

Military officials have been investigated more regularly in recent years as the Chinese government try to crack down on army corruption.
