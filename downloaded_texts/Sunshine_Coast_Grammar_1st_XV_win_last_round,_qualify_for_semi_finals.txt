Reigning Sunshine Coast Schoolboys Premier 1st XV champions have squeezed past Nambour Christian College seven points to five at the Nambour Rugby Club on Wednesday. They had qualified for the semi finals prior to the round.

The match was moved from the University due to the recent wet weather causing the ground to be water logged.

Grammar scored a converted try half way through the first half. Seven - nil. It remained that way at half time.

Ten minutes in the second, Nambour were able to score out wide but failed to convert. Seven - five. They fought hard in the next ten, but failed to capitalise on opportunities they created and Grammar mistakes. Nambour did not get another such opportunity after that.

Grammar now play minor premiers Mountain Creek State High School in a rematch of their 2007 semi final, while Siena Catholic College will host Matthew Flinders Anglican College in the other semi.
