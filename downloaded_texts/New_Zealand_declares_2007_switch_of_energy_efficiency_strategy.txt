The New Zealand Government's energy efficiency strategy has been considered ineffective and will hence be replaced in 2007. Energy Minister Trevor Mallard and the Government's spokeswoman on energy efficiency Jeanette Fitzsimons announced that the four-year-old National Energy Efficiency and Conservation Strategy would be revamped. Originally, this strategy was meant to achieve a 20 per cent improvement of the energy efficiency rate and increase renewable energy supply by 30 petajoules until 2012.
