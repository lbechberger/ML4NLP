Kurmanbek Bakiev has been sworn in as the president of Kyrgyzstan after winning the elections one month ago with an 89% majority.

Following the exile of the previous president, Askar Akayev, Bakiev was appointed acting president until elections were held.

Mr Bakiev's main competitor in the elections was Felix Kulov. They agreed upon a power-sharing pact, meaning that Mr Kulov would become Prime Minister if Mr Bakiev became president.

Bakiev took his oath of office after a military parade, in front of diginitaries in Bishkek's central square.
