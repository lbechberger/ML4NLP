Marc-Andre Fleury responded to Penguins coach Michel Therrien's criticism Tuesday night by holding the New Jersey Devils to one goal. Unfortunately for Fleury, Martin Brodeur was one goal better. Brodeur was spectacular in net once again, earning his NHL leading 12th shutout of the season. The Devils only goal of the night was scored by Jamie Langenbrunner on the Power Play, 3:00 into the second period, assisted by Scott Gomez and Patrick Elias.
