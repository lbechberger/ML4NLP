Three months after the FBI raided the offices of the Dorean Group in Union City, California, neighboring companies in the same office park have received letters claiming that rent for the office park should now be paid to the Dorean Group. The owner of the office park, Hanover Properties, insists that they have not sold the park and called the Dorean Group's claim fraudulent.

The first letter from the Dorean Group, dated May 2nd, 2005, purported to "inform [the tenants] of the change in ownership of the property [the tenants] now occupy," and asked that "payment of rents be sent" to the principals of the Dorean Group. The letter also included notarized documents authorizing the sale by an alleged agent of the current owner, Hanover Properties, a "Julia Pantibratyuk."

On the subsequent day, Hanover Properties responded in a letter to the other tenants of the park. They noted that they had not sold the office park to the Dorean Group, but that they had evicted the Dorean Group from the premises on April 26. They added that, "We do not know who Julia Pantbratyuk is."

The letters were provided to Wikinews reporter Pingswept by an employee of one of the companies in the office park.
