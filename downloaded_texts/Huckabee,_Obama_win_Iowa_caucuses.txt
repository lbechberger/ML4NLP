Former Governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee, an ordained Southern Baptist minister, won the Iowa Republican caucus, receiving 34% from Republican caucus goers. Huckabee beat out 6 other Republican candidates in the often turbulent campaign. As of 10:10 pm local Central Time the standings were Mike Huckabee (34%), Mitt Romney (25%), Fred Thompson (13%), John McCain (13%), Ron Paul (10%), Rudy Giuliani (4%), and Duncan Hunter (1%).

Meanwhile, Illinois senator Barack Obama won the Iowa Democratic caucus, drawing support from younger voters and getting 38% percent of the vote despite a close race with John Edwards and Hillary Clinton. Women, previously expected to largely back Clinton, split their vote between her and Obama, the latter of whom actually received slightly more support. As of 10 pm local Central Time the standings were Obama (38%), Edwards (30%), Clinton (29%), Bill Richardson (2%), Joe Biden (1%), and Christopher Dodd (0% but one delegate); Dennis Kucinich and Mike Gravel had earned no delegates at that point, and three delegates were uncommitted. Biden and Dodd have now withdrawn from the race due to the outcome of the caucus.
