George W. Bush, the current President of the United States yesterday claimed that the level of violence in Iraq has decreased to the lowest level since Spring 2004. In a speech made yesterday, Bush claimed that "Violence is down to its lowest level since the spring of 2004, and we're now in our third consecutive month with reduced violence levels holding steady." He then said that "a significant reason for this sustained progress is the success of the surge." 

Bush also praised the security forces of Iraq. He cited their "increasing capability" as another reason for the reduction in violence. "We saw the capability of those forces earlier this year, when the Iraqi government launched successful military operations against Shia extremist groups in Basra, Amarah, and the Sadr City area of Baghdad," he said. "Because of these operations, extremists who once terrorized the citizens of these communities have been driven from their strongholds."

The President continued by stating that the Iraqi government has made progress. "Iraqi Council of Representatives has passed several major pieces of legislation this year, and Iraqi leaders are preparing for provincial elections," he said, listing ways in which he believed the Iraqi government have progressed. 

Bush continued by discussing the withdrawal of troops:
