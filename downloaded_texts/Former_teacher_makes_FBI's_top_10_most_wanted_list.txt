Ex-Washington, D.C. third grade teacher Eric Justin Toth, who worked at the National Cathedral's Beauvoir school, was officially added to the top of the FBI's Ten Most Wanted Fugitive List yesterday, replacing Osama bin Laden, who was killed by US Navy Seals last May. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) began investigating Toth in 2008 when a school camera allegedly used by Toth contained child pornography.

The FBI also believes Toth was responsible for installing a camera in the student's bathroom near Toth's classroom.

When Toth became aware of the investigation he became a fugitive. Toth, who also goes by the name David Bussone, has warrants for his arrest in Maryland and the District of Columbia.

The FBI is currently offering a reward for up to $100,000 leading to Toth's arrest.

Toth is the 495th person to be placed on the Ten Most Wanted List.
