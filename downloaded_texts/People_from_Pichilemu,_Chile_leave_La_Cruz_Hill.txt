La Cruz Hill, Pichilemu, Chile — After last Thursday's 6.9 earthquake with epicentre in the coastal town of Pichilemu, Chile, people went to La Cruz Hill, the safest place in the town, with an elevation of almost 100 meters (328 ft). The tsunami warning was extended until 17:00 hrs. local time (20:00 UTC) that day. After it passed, many people came back to their homes, but some decided to stay at La Cruz Hill. "We are here because we fear of our safety. We don't want it [a possible tsunami] to catch us. We have to settle down here and to accommodate", said Edith Larraín to Wikinews. The Mayor of Pichilemu, Roberto Córdova, estimated that at least 2,000 people were staying at La Cruz Hill.

Last night the police, army, the province governor, and militaries went to the hill to inform the people that they had to leave the hill because of hygiene. They also claimed that ONEMI reported that the Nazca and South American plates were already accommodated, so there is no risk to another earthquake anymore. People didn't think it twice and they left the hill. Soon after, a 6.7 aftershock hit offshore Bío Bío. People came back in some minutes.

"We will not come back to the town, and you will not push us to do it", said Larraín, one of the people that was talking to the militaries. The dispute ended in a fight between a woman and a military. TV channels like Canal 13, went to report the dispute. "They will not move us from here", said Elena, mostly known as Fonola.

As reported by Tele13, the Mayor of Pichilemu, Roberto Córdova, said that "he can't fight against the fear of the people that was on the hill, but that he's doing the best he can."
