Four Pakistani police officers have been shot dead by suspected militants, according to police. The attackers allegedly shot into a police car before setting it on fire.

Two officers were also injured in the shooting, which was the region's second such attack in less than a month.

The local police chief commented on the incident. "An unknown number of gunmen used automatic rifles and rocket-propelled grenades to target the police party," he said.

An adviser to the Pakistani Prime Minister said that the peace deal signed with militants last month may be discontinued if incidents like this occur. He said that if there are incidents like this, there is "no point" in the government attempting to follow the agreement.
