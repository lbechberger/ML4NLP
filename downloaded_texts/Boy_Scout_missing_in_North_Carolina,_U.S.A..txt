Michael Auberry, a Troop 230 Boy Scout of Greensboro, North Carolina, has been reported missing from Stone Mountain State Park, in western North Carolina. Search crew are still trying to locate the missing 12-year-old boy in the nearly 13,750 acre park. Volunteer firefighters, National Park Service staff, and rescue squads are all searching at this moment.

He began missing at 12:30 p.m. and 1 p.m EST on Saturday. The scouts went on a hike while Auberry stayed back at the camp site with an adult. After, they had lunch with him and, later, Auberry was noted to be missing.

"We are not really sure why or what happened," said Saundra Lewis of the Wilkes County Rescue Squad. "He was seen at the campsite and then a few minutes later he was missing."

Auberry was last seen wearing blue jeans, a dark hat, and a red coat with reflective striping. His backpack was found at the campsite, and his mess kit was also located approximately a half-mile from the campsite.
