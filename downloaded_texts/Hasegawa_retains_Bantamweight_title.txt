Hozumi Hasegawa (長谷川穂積), record 18 Wins - 2 Losses, fought Gerardo Martinez, 27 Wins - 5 Losses - 2 Draws, for the WBC Bantamweight Title Sunday night in Yokohama, Japan. Hasegawa won by TKO in the 7th round, retaining his title.

Hasegawa, 26, from Kobe, was defending the title he gained against Thai fighter Veeraphol Sahaprom at the Nippon Budokan in April of this year. Originally he was scheduled to fight Diego Morales, who dropped out due to injury and was replaced by Martinez, 30, from Mexico City. 

Hasegawa appeared to control the fight from early on, fighting at a measured pace and landing several punches in the early rounds. Martinez visually tired by the fifth round, though he came back with some strength in the sixth. Early in the seventh round, however, Martinez suffered a knockdown, followed by a stunning left, after which he struggled to gain control. After fierce close-quarters fighting, he staggered backwards and fell, hand to his left temple. The official called the match at 2:18. 

Today was Hasegawa's third wedding anniversary.
