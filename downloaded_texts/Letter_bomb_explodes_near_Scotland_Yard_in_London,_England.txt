At least one woman was injured after a letter bomb exploded inside the Capita Group Plc building on Victoria Street, near Scotland Yard which is located in the central part of London, England. The woman was holding the bomb when it exploded and suffered injuries to her stomach and hands.

"We were called at around 9.40 this morning to reports of a suspect package at a business address in Victoria Street," said a spokesperson for Scotland Yard.

Victoria Street has been shutdown from Westminster Abbey to Scotland Yard while rescuers and police investigate the incident.

"Officers are attending the scene to establish the circumstances. As a precaution, a cordon has been put in place around the scene," said another police spokesperson.

The bomb was inside a "jiffy bag" which held the letter which was contained inside a padded envelope. The explosion occurred inside the office's mailroom.

The woman who was injured was not believed to be the target. Police will not say to whom the letter was addressed.

There are no reports of other injuries or deaths so far.

"We are not in a position to discuss who may or may not be responsible at this stage," said police.
