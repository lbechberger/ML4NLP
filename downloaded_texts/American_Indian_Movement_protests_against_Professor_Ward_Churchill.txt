The American Indian Movement protested against the controversial professor Ward Churchill, chairman of the Department of Ethnic Studies at the University of Colorado, who in a paper written after the September 11, 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center in New York, compared the victims of the attack to "little Eichmanns".

The American Indian Movement says Churchill’s statements comparing victims to Nazi war criminal Adolf Eichmann who implemented Adolf Hitler’s plan to exterminate European Jews and others should be condemned by all. Also, they say Churchill fraudulently represents himself as an Indian and a member of the American Indian Movement.

Additionally, Ward Churchill has perpetrated art fraud and plagerism. He was banned from selling his artwork in 1990.
