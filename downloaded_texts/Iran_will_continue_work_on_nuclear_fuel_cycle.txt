Outgoing Iranian president Mohammad Khatami said that the proposed nuclear fuel work would not include producing enriched uranium, but stressed that Iran would ultimately resume its uranium enrichment programme.


Khatami told reporters "Whether Europeans mention our right to resume activities at the uranium conversion facility at Isfahan or not, we will definitely resume them regardless."

Iran has consistently maintained that it has a right to develop its own nuclear fuel cycle from its indigenous uranium resources to produce power. Though Iran has large oil stocks, environmental concerns and the Kyoto Protocol may preclude their continued development.
