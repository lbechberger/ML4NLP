The National Hurricane Center Tropical Prediction Center has upgraded Tropical Depression 15-E to Tropical Storm status. The storm, now officially Tropical Storm Norman, is the 15th named storm of the 2006 Pacific hurricane season. The storm currently has maximum sustained winds of 45 miles per hour. Norman is located well to the southwest of Baja California, and is currently tracking north at 7 miles per hour.

The storm is expected to slowly curve to the northeast as it slowly strengthening, then slowly weaken when it moves over colder waters. There is a chance that it could bring winds and rain to Baja California before it dissipates.

All individuals who may be impacted by this storm are urged to track its progress as it develops over the next few days.
