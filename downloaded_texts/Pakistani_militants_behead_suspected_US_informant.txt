Pro-Taliban militants in Pakistan's troubled Waziristan province decapitated a cab driver on suspicions that he was an American informant. This is the fourth such killing in the region this month. 

The deceased was found on Tuesday in a town 25 kilometres south of Wana in an area where US forces are hunting Al-Qaeda militants. Two weeks ago, another decapitated body was found with a note saying the victim was an American spy and that other US sympathizers could expect to meet the same fate. Waziristan, like Baluchistan, is engaged in a small-scale civil conflict with the Pakistani military.
