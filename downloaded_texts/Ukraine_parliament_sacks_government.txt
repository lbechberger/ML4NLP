The Ukrainian parliament passed a vote of no-confidence in the government of Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych bolstering the efforts of opposition leader Viktor Yushchenko. In addition, the parliament also voted to establish an interim government during the continuing election crisis.

The vote came just before international mediators were to commence efforts to resolve the controversial election.
