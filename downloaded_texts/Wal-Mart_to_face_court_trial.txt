A federal court has upheld a ruling given in 2004 granting class action status for a suit against the American retail giant Wal-Mart. As many as 1.6 million or more women employees might file civil suits alleging Wal-Mart discriminated against their sex.


Six women in 2001 claimed that the company paid them less than men. 

"It is time for Wal-Mart to face the music," said Brad Seligman, a lawyer representing the female plaintiffs. "Two courts now have ruled that Wal-Mart is going to have to face a jury ... We fully expect Wal-Mart to keep appealing but we're very confident now that two courts have upheld this (class) certification."

"Factual evidence, statistical evidence and anecdotal evidence present significant proof of a corporate policy of discrimination and support plaintiff's contention that female employees nationwide were subjected to a common pattern and practice of discrimination," said Judge Martin Jenkins.

This lawsuit only counts for female workers that have worked for the company since December 26, 1998.
