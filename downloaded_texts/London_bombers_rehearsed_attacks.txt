Police at Scotland Yard have discovered that the suicide bombers who mounted an attack on London on July 7th had rehearsed their plan nine days earlier.

As part of the formal investigation into the attacks, detectives studied thousands of hours of CCTV footage. The images show three of the bombers entering Luton station, before travelling to King's Cross station where they are also pictured.

Police were able to trace their movements after recovering tickets and receipts from houses connected to the bombers which indicated the route of their trip.

Scotland Yard says the practice run shows 'terrorist methodology'. Over 3,000 witness statements have been gathered and 80,000 CCTV tapes analysed, and the investigation is expected to carry on for many months to come.
