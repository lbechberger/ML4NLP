The production companies of the United States television programme The X Factor US have confirmed that Cheryl Cole has been removed from the judging panel for the show.

Fox Broadcasting Company, the show's broadcaster, made the announcement on Monday alongside FremantleMedia North America and Syco TV, the production companies of the programme. Nicole Scherzinger has also been reported to take up the position Cole will vacate. Steve Jones, a former T4 presenter, will now be the solitary presenter of the programme. The three other judges on the panel will consist of Simon Cowell, Paula Abdul and L.A. Reid.

Fox and the production companies have stated: "Nicole Scherzinger will be replacing Cheryl Cole on the judging panel of The X Factor. Nicole will join Simon Cowell, L.A. Reid and Paula Abdul on their search across America to find the next global superstar or group to win the life-changing $5 million dollar recording deal. Nicole has previously joined Simon Cowell as a guest judge on The X Factor for the UK version of the show in 2010. Steve Jones will act as sole host of The X Factor."

Having previously been released from her position, Cole declined the opportunity to reclaim her position on the UK version of the show. On Saturday, the programme makers gave Cole a time period of 24 hours to decide whether or not to be a judge on The X Factor US once again; she subquently rejected the offer.
