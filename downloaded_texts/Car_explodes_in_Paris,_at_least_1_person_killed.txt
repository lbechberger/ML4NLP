A car bomb exploded in a car traveling on the A1 highway north of Paris, France, killing one man. The incident happened in the département of Seine-Saint-Denis, near the Paris suburb of La Courneuve.

A passenger in the car was injured and hospitalized. The passenger, whose life is not in danger, was to be questioned.

A French fire brigade received the call just before 10:00AM GMT to put out a car fire. A criminal act is suspected — terrorism has been discounted, although murder by planting a bomb in a victim's car is said to be unusual in France. Checks were to be done for a possible criminal background of the dead man.
