One month ago, the French soccer team took its revenge over Italy (World cup title holders) but the gap to stay number one remains slim.

Most of this margin is only due to the victory over Brazil in Mondial quarter finals but any further loss (not expected against FaroÃ« Islands next Wednesday) is enough not to stay in the leading chair.

Both teams are likely to be hoping for a draw as the worst result, which would leave the situation as:

* Scotland top of the round-robin group;
* France World #1.
