Bruce Hyman, the UK barrister who pleaded guilty to perverting the course of justice in August was sentenced to one year in prison at Bristol Crown Court yesterday. He is reported to be the only barrister ever to have been sentenced for such an offence. After having pleaded in mitigation to be suffering from agitated depression and presenting a character reference from Sir Mark Potter, Head of the Family Division of the High Court, Hyman will now serve about six months with remission.

Hyman's crime, as reported last month, was calculated to send an innocent father to prison by providing him with a faked Court of Appeal judgment.
