Bayer Leverkusen has appointed SpVgg Greuther Fürth Head Coach Bruno Labbadia as the club's new Head Coach. Michael Skibbe was fired last week after failing to qualify for a European competition. Labbadia signed a 2-year contract.

Bruno Labbadia scored 103 goals in 328 Bundesliga games while playing as a forward for Bayern München, Werder Bremen and Hamburger SV.

Labbadia led Greuther Fürth to 6th place in the 2nd division in the 2007/08 season.
