Wednesday evening, Nicolas Sarkozy (UMP) and Ségolène Royal (Socialist Party) debated live on national TV in France. About 20 million viewers, about half the number of registered voters watched. This was the only head-to-head debate between the two remaining presidential candidates, and only the fifth such debate in the history of the French Fifth Republic.





The second round of popular voting will be held this Sunday, May 6, 2007. In the first round, Sarkozy got 31.18% of the vote, while Royal received 25.87%. This time they will be the only two candidates.
