Gidget, the chihuahua featured in the Taco Bell adverts in the United States has died from a stroke. The dog died at the age of 15 on Tuesday night. Sue Chipperton, the owner and trainer of Gidget commented saying, "She made so many people happy." She passed at Chipperton's home in Santa Clarita, California. 

The dog was featured in the 1990s adverts that ran from 1997 to 2000. Gidget was portrayed as a male dog and is remembered for the dubbed saying "Yo quiero Taco Bell" which is Spanish for "I want Taco Bell." The advert was meant to be shown only once but was turned into a campaign. 

Gidget was also featured in Legally Blonde 2 and adverts for the board game Trivial Pursuit.
