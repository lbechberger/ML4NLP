A bright object was seen falling over the night sky across the Pacific Northwest, at about 7:45 p.m. Pacific time March 12. Eyewitnesses from as far south as Northern California and as far north as Vancouver, British Columbia reported seeing the object falling in the western sky.

“The object began as a small white dot roughly the brightness of a planet, and quickly became a brilliant blue-green color with a long spark-like tail of yellow specks. From my vantage in Southeast Portland, Oregon it moved roughly from south to north and at a 45-degree angle downwards through the sky. I also saw two flashes of white light as the object disappeared behind the hills on the west bank of the Willamette River,” reported Wikinews contributor Buckwad.

It is not known if the object impacted, but it was witnessed to fall over the Pacific Ocean.

The last reported meteor impact in the Oregon area happened in May 1981.
