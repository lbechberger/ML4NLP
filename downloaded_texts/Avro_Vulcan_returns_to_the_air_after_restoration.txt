For the first time in 14 years, an Avro Vulcan heavy bomber has taken to the skies over England. The newly-restored aircraft took off from Bruntingthorpe Aerodrome, Leicestershire. 

The craft flew for about 25 minutes in the first of three planned test flights from Bruntingthorpe Aerodrome, meant to prove that the craft is officially "airworthy", the only Vulcan to hold such a distinction. It has taken Â£6 million to return the aircraft to service.

The aircraft, XH558, bombed the Argentinian-held Port Stanley in the Falkand Islands during the 1982 conflict.
