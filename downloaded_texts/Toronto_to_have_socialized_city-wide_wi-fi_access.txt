Toronto's public utility, Toronto Hydro Telecom, will make Canada's largest city into a huge wireless hotspot.

"This is both an exciting and very important initiative for the city of Toronto", said Toronto's mayor, David Miller. "It puts us on the leading edge of the telecommunications industry nationwide and globally."

Toronto Hydro Telecom will offer customers free access for the first six months. After that, it will begin to charge for services.

"Wi-Fi technology is the new benchmark for urban living", stated Toronto Hydro president David Dobbin. "It's standard equipment in many electronic devices, from laptops to portable entertainment units."

Private telephone companies are questioning why a public utility needs to compete with the private sector.

Mike Lee of Rogers Communications Inc. questioned why the city of Toronto wanted to enter the internet access business.

"It will not be an easy business", Lee told the National Post. "In this day and age, the focus should be on core operations more than anything. I was surprised to see they are looking to get into this business."

Brian Sharwood, a telecom analyst in Toronto, said the municipality will likely install the wireless transmitters and receivers on its lamp posts as a way to blanket the city, a process known as "wireless mesh networking".
