Yesterday, Milan Lučić's family returned home and found their home ransacked by burglars. It was discovered that the young NHL star's prized Memorial Cup ring and several valuable tournament watches were stolen from their home in Vancouver, Canada .

Lučić's mother, Snežana, has said that the thieves gained entrance to the family's home by smashing in the back door.

Lučić, 20, who lives with his parents, Dobrivoje and Snežana, is a player for the Boston Bruins and flew to Boston on Wednesday to help out at a rookies camp.

"We don't know if it was random," she said. "They went into his room upstairs and took his Memorial Cup ring and three of his Esquire watches."

Other rooms in the home were ransacked and alcohol was stolen.

"He was very disappointed," said Snežana, referring to Lučić's reaction when she called her son in Boston shortly after the robbery.

Before Lučić flew to Boston. he told Snežana before flying to Boston he was thinking about his memorabilia and recalled how, last summer, former goalie for the Edmonton Oilers, Bill Ranford, was robbed of memorabilia from his New Westminster home.

"So in a way he wasn't surprised," Snežana said.

Lučić was raised in East Vancouver. He carried the Vancouver Giants to a Memorial Cup victory in 2007. He was awarded as the Most Valuable Player and led the Giants in scoring for the 2006-07 season.

Lučić accumulated 27 points and 89 penalty minutes in his play for with the Boston Bruins last season.

According to Snežana the NHL has been advised of the burglary and intends to monitor websites like Craigslist and eBay to see if someone attempts to sell the distinctive ring.

The Vancouver Police Department's investigation is ongoing.
