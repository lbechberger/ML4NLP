A 6.5 magnitude earthquake occurred in Acre, a Brazilian state, at 16:18:29 UTC (11:18 local time), United States Geological Survey (USGS) reported. It had a depth of 565.3 kilometers.

The epicenter was located 125 kilometers east-southeast of Cruzeiro do Sul, Brazil, 330 kilometers east of Pucallpa, Peru, 460 kilometers south-southwest of Tabatinga, Brazil, and 2700 kilometers west-northwest of Brasilia, Brazil.

A civil defence service spokesman in Cruziero do Sul reported to Times Live that the quake was unnoticed. "This zone suffers a lot of earthquakes, but the last one we really felt was 20 days ago. We didn't register any disorder or damage on the surface," he said.

"Generally speaking, quakes more than 500 kilometres deep don't leave signals in the surface, they are only detected by instruments," said an official of Brazil's Seismological Observatory to AFP.
