At 10.45 local time, Crown Princess Mette-Marit of Norway gave birth to a boy at Norway's national hospital, the Rikshospitalet University Hospital in Oslo. The new prince is third in line to the throne. "All is well with mother and son," Crown Prince Haakon confirmed at a press conference later that day. Due to strict official protocol the name will not be made public until Monday, when King Harald will gather the "State Council", or the cabinet, and inform the government. Usually the Prime Minister will announce the name in front of the Royal Palace.
