Honduran President Manuel Zelaya was expelled by the country's army on Sunday. Zelaya declares the action a coup d'Ã©tat. 

"Today's events originate from a court order by a competent judge. The armed forces, in charge of supporting the constitution, acted to defend the state of law and have been forced to apply legal dispositions against those who have expressed themselves publicly and acted against the dispositions of the basic law," said the supreme court in Honduras.

Zelaya was attempting to change the constitution via a constitutional referendum to allow himself to be re-elected following the 2009 Honduran political crisis.

Speaking from Costa Rica, Zelaya said, "Tomorrow, I will attend in the Summit of Central American presidents in Managua." 

Leaders from around the world have reacted to the ouster, saying it is against the Inter-American Democratic Charter and the Vienna Convention.

"I call on all political and social actors in Honduras to respect democratic norms, the rule of law and the tenets of the Inter-American Democratic Charter," President of the United States Barack Obama said, "Any existing tensions and disputes must be resolved peacefully through dialogue free from any outside interference."
