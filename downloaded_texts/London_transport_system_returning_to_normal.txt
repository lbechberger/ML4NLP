Twenty-four hours after a series of bomb blasts rocked London, the city's transport system is returning to normal, although a series of security alerts have caused some disruption.

All the major train stations are now open, with the only service alteration being at King's Cross, where GNER is operating a revised service. Suburban services in and out of King's Cross are normal.

On the London Underground, services are running on most lines with only some delays. Four lines are still seriously affected though:

*Piccadilly line: No service from Hyde Park Corner to Arnos Grove. Buses are running from Arnos Grove to Finchley Central to connect with Northern line services.

*Circle and Hammersmith &amp; City lines: closed

*Metropolitan line: no trains running between Baker Street and Aldgate

*District line: no service from High Street Kensington to Edgware Road

The King's Cross St Pancras station is also closed.

On the roads, the London Congestion Charge has been suspended, although Transport for London is advising against driving in central London today.

Several roads remain closed as of 9.20am BST - the A11 (Aldgate Highstreet) and the A1211 at the A10 in Bishop's Gate are both shut to traffic. 

The A4200 (Eversholt Street) is closed between the junctions with the A501 (Euston Road) and the A40 (Vernon Place).

The A3212 (Millbank) is closed between the A3203 (Westminster) and the A202 (Vauxhall Bridge Road).

Finally, the B452 (Argyle Road / Drayton Green Road) is closed between Sutherland Road and Manor Road.

Outside of London, the motorway network is running well.

One Wikinews reporter in Central London noted how many more cyclists there were, especially in Hyde Park.
