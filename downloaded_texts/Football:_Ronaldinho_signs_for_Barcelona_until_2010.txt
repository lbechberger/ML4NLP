A Brazilian international footballer, Ronaldo de Assis Moreira, also known as Little Ronaldo (Ronaldinho), signed a contract with FC Barcelona until 2010, today, prolonging it for two years. 

It is fairly certain that he will stay in the club for the length of the contract. "Now I'll just carry on doing the same as I have been doing until now, only that now I have a longer term contract, I'll be even more motivated," an official Barcelona website quoted Ronaldinho. According to a new clause in his contract, any club who wants to buy him will have to part with 85 million pounds. One of the most interested teams was Chelsea FC, who were looking to fill their striker position. 

Ronaldinho is happy to stay in Barcelona: "You cannot put a price on the happiness and joy I am feeling right now." He transferred from Paris Saint-Germain in 2003 for 17 million pounds becoming one of the biggest football starts in Spain. FIFA awarded him the prestigous title of "best football player in the world" in 2005.
