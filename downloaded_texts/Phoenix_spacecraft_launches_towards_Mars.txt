NASA's Phoenix spacecraft has launched from the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, atop a Delta II 7925 rocket, on the first leg of its mission to land on Mars. Lift-off occurred from LC-17A, at 5:26:34 a.m. EDT (UTC-4). The spacecraft separated from its carrier rocket about 85 minutes after launch.

The mission is the first in NASA's Mars Scout program. It was originally scheduled to launch on August 3, but was delayed 24 hours due to a weather concern preventing second stage fueling on August 1.
