Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak has announced that he will not seek re-election in September 2011, after an uprising against him across the country. Mubarak stated on state television, "I will say with all honesty and without looking at this particular situation that I was not intent on standing for the next elections, because I have spent enough time in serving Egypt." Mubarak added, "I am now careful to conclude my work for Egypt by presenting Egypt to the next government in a constitutional way which will protect Egypt."

Soon after his announcement, protesters filled the street, demanding that he resign immediately. United States president Barack Obama spoke with Mubarak after the announcement to discuss the situation in Egypt. Obama said at the White House, "[Mubarak] recognizes that the status quo is not sustainable and that change must take place. [...] My belief that an orderly transition must be meaningful, it must be peaceful, and it must begin now."

The country has released statements since Sunday calling for a "orderly transition", with interim leadership to prepare for the September election. United States Senator John F. Kerry called upon Hosni to work to create "an interim, caretaker government as soon as possible to oversee an orderly transition in the coming months." In Egypt, the address sparked rioting after, as citizens were angered that the president refused to resign at once. The popular uprising in Egypt began on January 25, 2011, in the wake of the Tunisian uprising weeks before.
