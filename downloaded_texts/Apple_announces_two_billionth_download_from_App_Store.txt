On Monday, computer company Apple announced that they had had two billion downloads from the iTunes App Store. The 1 billionth application, or app, was downloaded in April 2009 and the 1.5 billionth app was downloaded in July. This announcement means that in the space of just five months, the number of apps downloaded from the App Store has doubled.

There are currently over 85,000 apps available on the App Store. In comparison to this number, rival platform Google Android has roughly 10,000 apps, whereas Palm Pre has less.

There are about 50 million iPhone and iPod Touch users worldwide. There are over 125,000 developers in the iPhone Developer Program. Steve Jobs, Chief Executive of Apple, said: "The rate of App Store downloads continues to accelerate with users downloading a staggering 2 billion apps in just over a year, including more than half a billion apps this quarter alone. The App Store has reinvented what you can do with a mobile handheld device, and our users are clearly loving it."

On Monday, the iPhone was also voted the number 1 "coolest brand of 2009" in a CoolBrands survey, causing former leader of three years Aston Martin to lose the number 1 position. The iPhone also beat the iPod, Nintendo, YouTube, Google, PlayStation, Xbox amongst other popular brands. In a statement released CoolBrands chairman Stephen Cheliotis said: "The iPhone is something everyone's been talking about. There has been such a buzz around it - and people that haven't got one, want one."
