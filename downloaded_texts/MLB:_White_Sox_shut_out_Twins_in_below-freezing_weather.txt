In a chilly Saturday afternoon game at U.S. Cellular Field in Chicago, the air temperature hovering around freezing the entire game, the Minnesota bats were ice cold. White Sox pitching staff held the Minnesota Twins to only three hits. White Sox starter Javier Vázquez pitched more than six innings and gave up only a single hit in the second. Twins starter Carlos Silva gave up what would end up being the winning run in the first.

Paul Konerko picked up an RBI in the first inning on a single to the outfield that scored Darin Erstad, putting Chicago ahead by one. Juan Uribe would extend the lead with a solo home run in the eighth before an attempted pickoff throw failed and the ball trickled to the outfield, allowing Scott Podsednik to score from second base.

Friday evening's series opener between the AL-Central Division rivals was postponed due to the inclement cold weather, and has not yet been rescheduled. The White Sox, now 2-2, and Twins, now 3-1, will finish their series with an Easter Sunday matinée game. Highs tomorrow in Chicago are forecasted to be slightly warmer in the upper-30s.
