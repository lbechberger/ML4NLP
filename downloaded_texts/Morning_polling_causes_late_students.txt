Polling places opened at 13:00 UTC (8:00 AM EST) this morning in Palm Beach County, Florida for the United States midterm elections. Early voters wreaked havoc on the city streets, causing backups near polling locations and interrupting traffic flows to area elementary and senior high schools.

Due to the increase in traffic, some area school administrations asked teachers to accept late students without reprimand.

Florida will elect a Federal senator, all of its House membership, a Governor, various other officers and vote on various questions.
