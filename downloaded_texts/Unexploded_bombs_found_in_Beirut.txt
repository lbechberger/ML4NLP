In Beirut, the capital of Lebanon, the Internal Security Forces (ISF) found bomb-making equipment in three separate caches on Thursday, two days after a bomb was discovered in Beirut. This had stroke fears among many Lebanese who were still dramatized by recent bus bombings and street clashes. A wooden box, armed with nineteen TNT sticks, was found in Beirut's Christian neighborhood, Achrafieh, by a scrap collector. The box was found in a dumpster on Hikmeh Avenue leading to Corniche al-Nahr, facing the Murr Television Station and the Mont Liban Radio building.

The box of TNT sticks was found approximately at 8:30 a.m. The police immediately rushed to the scene and cut off the city from the public to disarm the bomb.

Half an hour later, employees of Lebanon's privatized waste management company, Sukleen, found an aluminum box packed with thirteen detonators. The box was found about 200 meters away from the wooden one.

By the end of the day, bombs were found on the road leading to the Kesrouan village of Ghbaleh, the National News Agency (NNA) reported. However, NNA stated that the bombs were not meant to explode. ISF's investigation was immediately conducted.
