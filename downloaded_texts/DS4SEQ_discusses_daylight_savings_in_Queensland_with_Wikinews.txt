Wikinews recently held an interview with the Daylight Saving for South East Queensland (DS4SEQ) political party about the upcoming Queensland state election.

DS4SEQ is a single issue party which, as its name suggests, advocates the implementation of daylight saving in South East Queensland. Currently Queensland runs on Australian Eastern Standard Time (UTC+10).
