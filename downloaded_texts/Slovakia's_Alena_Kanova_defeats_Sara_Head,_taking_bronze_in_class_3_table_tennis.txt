London, England— Slovakian fans were out in force at London's ExCeL earlier today, watching the 23-minute table tennis match between Great Britain's Sara Head and their country's Alena Kanova. The battle for bronze in the women's single class 3 match ended with Kanova winning by 3 sets to 1 to take the medal.

Head took an early lead, winning the first set 11–2 before going down to Kanova in the second set by 5–11. Head kept the scoring closer in the third set at 4–7 at one point, before losing 5–11. The British fans dominated Slovakia in terms of volume, chanting "G-B! G-B!" in support of their player, with the occasional shout of "Go Sara!". The Slovaks ruled the stands in terms of waving large flags. A loud chant from Great Britain's fans stopped abruptly after Kanova scored. Head could not come back in the fourth set, losing 3–11 and seeing Kanova take the bronze.
