In a convoy ambush Monday in southeastern Afghanistan, 8 Taliban rebels were killed and 16 captured after a fire fight that ended after Afghan coalition forces called in U.S. air power for support. There were no reported coalition casualties.

The convoy was travelling in the Zabul's Dai Chopan district when the ambush occurred. Afghan Defence Ministry spokesman General Muhammad said, "After the ambush, fierce fighting broke out and we called in coalition air support," according to Reuters.

U.S. ground forces were also involved in the fighting where several weapons and two satellite phones were seized from the rebels. Zabul province lies along the rugged Afghan-Pakistani border where pockets of Osama bin Laden's Al-Qaeda terror network are thought to be holding out.
