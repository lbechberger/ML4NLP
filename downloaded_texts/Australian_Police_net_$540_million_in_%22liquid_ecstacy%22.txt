Police in Sydney have seized 1,900 litres of 3,4-methylenedioxyphenyl-2-propanone, a chemical known as "liquid ecstacy" during a raid in the North-Western Sydney suburb of Castle Hill. Authorities estimate the chemical could be used to make up to two tonnes of ecstacy with an estimated street value of AU$540 million (over $400 million).

Police claim the bust is one of the largest in Australia's history.

The operation was carried out by New South Wales, Victorian and Australian Federal Police.

Police are yet to make an arrest and are continuing their investigations.
