After substantial gains yesterday, U.S. stocks rallied again this afternoon. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at 11,543.32, up 45.23 from yesterday and reached a four month high.

This despite the fact that crude oil showed a slight rebound today of 21 cents, closing at $63.97 a barrel after seven days of losses. The increase came after the U.S. Department of Energy reported that crude oil inventories fell more than expected last week.
