A sticker for the Pensacola, Florida folk-punk band This Bike Is A Pipe Bomb was found on a bike near the Ohio University's Oasis restaurant by a university police officer.

The university police, who were unaware of the band's existence, summoned the Columbus police bomb squad, who destroyed the bike to ensure that there was no bomb inside. The university later discovered their error.

The bike's owner, a graduate student, has been charged with "inducing panic," a misdemeanor. He has been released and is due to appear in court March 13 on the charge.

The band's label, Plan-It-X Records, has not yet commented on the incident. The font and style of the sticker are common among such humorous stickers.
