Defending Wimbledon Ladies Singles champion Maria Sharapova has been beaten by Venus Williams in the 2005 semi-final by two sets to love. In the final game, Williams came to match point twice, just as rain began to fall. Both that and the preceding game were hard fought, with a succession of deuces.

The other semi-final, between Amelie Mauresmo and Lindsey Davenport, will resume tomorrow after rain forced an early end to play today. The match will resume with Davenport a break up in the final set. The previous sets both went to tie-breaks after both players exchanged breaks of serve.

Both matches were played at the same time - Williams and Sharapova on Centre Court, with Davenport and Mauresmo on No.1 - after early rain meant players could not get onto the courts until late afternoon.
