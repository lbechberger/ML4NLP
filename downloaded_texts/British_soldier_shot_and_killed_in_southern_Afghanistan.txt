A British soldier has been killed in southern Afghanistan, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) says.

A spokeswoman from the MoD said: "It is with deep regret that the MoD can confirm the death of a British soldier during a contact with enemy insurgents in northern Helmand, Afghanistan, at approximately 0500 local time. The soldier was shot and killed during an attack in northern Helmand. Next of kin are being informed and no further details will be released until that process is completed."

Eight British soldiers have died in Afghanistan this month. In total, twenty-one have died since military operations started in November 2001.
