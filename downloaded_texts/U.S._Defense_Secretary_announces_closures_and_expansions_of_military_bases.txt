United States Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld announced the closure of 33 major military facilities in 22 states around the U.S. When word of the plans to shuffle facilities was released, closing some and expanding others, many community leaders shuddered.

Cities like San Antonio, Texas, a town built on the back of military establishments, fear the possible economic effects. If the city's bases were closed, the city and local businesses could be crippled. The current announcement, however, benefits the city of San Antonio with the expansion of Ft. Sam Houston, despite the closure of two air bases.

Groton, Connecticut, on the other hand faces the closure of a submarine base. Senator Joseph Lieberman (D-Conn) claimed the closure was "cruel and unusual punishment." His state would lose 7,133 military jobs as well as 1,041 civilian jobs. Many communities around the nation stand to lose, while others could end up winners, as a result of the announced re-shuffle.
