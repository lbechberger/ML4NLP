The alleged Russian spy who called himself Paul William Hampel was deported out of Canada on Tuesday. It is believed by CSIS, the Canadian intelligence agency, that Hampel was part of Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service.

Justice Pierre Blais, who took his case, ordered the alleged Russian spy's deportation on December 4th. Customs Canada sent the man to the airport at 11:00 p.m. on Christmas Day. The man arrived in the Russian capital at 7:35 the next day.

Public Safety Minister Stockwell Day said that Russia provided papers to allow the man to return to his home country. 

"He was closely monitored the whole time," Day told the Canadian Press on Tuesday. "We didn't think he was a risk to flee but the usual procedures were in place." 

"As this case demonstrates, individuals who do not respect our laws and threaten the safety of our communities are not welcome in Canada."

Day also said the incident would not ruin Canada's relations with Russia. 

"We understand that these things go on in the world, the Russians understand that also."

The man, when he was in Montreal's federal court, said that he is a Russian citizen that is in Canada illegally. The judge, who took his case, allowed Hampel's true identity to remain secret. When Hampel was arrested he was carrying more than $7,800 in many currencies and three mobile phones.

Hampel stayed in Canada for about 10 years.
