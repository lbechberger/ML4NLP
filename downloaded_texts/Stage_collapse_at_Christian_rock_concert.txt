Over 40 people were injured, three of them seriously, after the auditorium floor collapsed at a church in Abbotsford, BC, Canada.

Around 9:20 pm PDT Friday night an approximated 900 square foot section of the stage and floor collapsed at a Starfield concert attended by as many as 1200 people at Central Heights Church. Reports from the concert goers indicate that sound and lighting scaffolds collapsed onto the front section of the stage and mosh pit, though it is not yet clear whether this was the cause of or the result of the floor collapsing into the basement 15 feet below.

Abbotsford Police Constable Casey Vinet stated that all available city police, fire and ambulance units responded to the scene, along with units from neighboring jurisdictions.
