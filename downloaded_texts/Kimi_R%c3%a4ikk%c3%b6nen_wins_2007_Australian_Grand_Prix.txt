Ferrari driver Kimi Räikkönen won the FIA Formula-1 2007 ING Australian Grand Prix on the Albert Park Circuit in Melbourne. More precisely he made a hat-trick of wins dating back to 2005.

Both McLaren-Mercedes drivers appear to be his major rivals for the new season as Fernando Alonso and Lewis Hamilton made a double finishing 2nd and 3rd consequently, with Hamilton on his debut race.

Nick Heidfeld, driving for BMW Sauber, had a promising start and stayed with Kimi for the first part of the race, but his early first pit-stop pushed him back to the 4th place, while his Polish teammate Robert Kubica retired due to technical problems towards the end of the race.

Felipe Massa was penalized for the engine change after his previous engine failed during qualification, but showed a good pace and for the dying laps of the race pushed hard on Renault driver Giancarlo Fisicella. The few overtaking attempts were not successful enough and so Filipe saw the checkered flag behind Giancarlo on the six place.

7th, 8th and 9th places fell to Nico Rosberg driving for Williams with Toyota engines and both 
Toyota drivers, Ralf Schumacher and Jarno Trulli.

The top 10 was closed by Renault rookie Heikki Kovalainen who made numerous driving errors in the closing stages of the race.

The 2007 Formula-1 season from now appears to be a highly competitive season after Michael Schumacher retired from the sport at the end of the 2006 season.
