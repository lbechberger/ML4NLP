The United States Navy has been ordered to the Somalian coastline in an attempt to stop members of the Union of Islamic Courts from escaping the country.

Naval forces have been boarding ships searching for fighters who might be hiding on them to escape Somalia. 

"We...are going to be working closely with states in the region to ensure that these individuals aren't able to transit those borders and exit Somalia," said a spokesman for the U.S. State Department, Sean McCormack.

Uganda is also expected to help with the fleeing militants by providing peacekeepers for Somalia, but Uganda's parliament must first approve the request.

"The troops are ready but I have to consult the speaker of parliament. As soon as parliament approves, they will be sent to Somalia," said Ugandan President, Yoweri Museveni. If Uganda's Parliament approves, between 1,200 and 2,000 peacekeepers will be deployed inside Somalia. The force, with approval, could be ready in at least a month.

Currently, no U.S. troops are engaged in fighting inside Somalia.
