A man living in Gambia, who has allegedly escaped from prison in the United States, is now facing 21 charges in his home country. He pleaded 'not guilty' to all the charges. The charges range from money laundering to forgery, impersonation and unlawful possession of a Gambian passport.

The defendant uses a variety of different names including Christopher Badjie, Christopher Bah, Sulayman Badjie, Joseph Moneke, Bantou Coli and Gerard Charles Hendrik Van Derwatt. The Point, a Gambain newspaper, claims that his real name is Christopher Badgie.

One of the charges against the defendant is relating to the alleged defrauding of a woman in Windsor, United Kingdom. It has been claimed that she was tricked into paying GBP650,000 with the belief that she would receive diamonds in return.

Another charge against the defendant says that he was unlawfully possessing a Gambian passport and identity card.

The defendant has been granted bail for the court case, which continued yesterday.
