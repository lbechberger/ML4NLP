Assistant Commissioner Giossi Labi, acting divisional police commander for the Mamose region of Papua New Guinea, as well as his son Elias and two other relatives were attacked by a group armed with guns and bush-knives (machetes) who demanded money in the early morning of January 13, at Voco Point beach, Lae.

Mr. Labi told The National on January 14:

Elias and the other two men were stabbed in the back while lying on the ground.

Police arrested ten suspects, four of which were released after questioning.

22 houses in Keks settlement, of which the attackers are alleged to be residents, were burnt to the ground in response to the attack, destroying the property of 36 people. Lae police commander Superintendent Simon Kauba denied any police involvement, saying that the houses were destroyed by people from nearby areas frustrated with persistent crime.
