Ferrari driver Felipe Massa won yesterday's FIA Formula One (F1) 2008 Grande Prêmio Santander Brazilian Grand Prix at Autódromo José Carlos Pace, São Paulo, Brazil.

Lewis Hamilton, who drives for McLaren, was able to hold on to take the F1 Driver's Championship. He had a seven point lead in the season standings entering the Brazilian Grand Prix.

Fernando Alonso came second while his Renault team mate Nelson Piquet Jr. slipped in the Senna's S-curve and broke his car's rear due to the wet track.

Massa's teammate Kimi Räikkönen came third.

On the final lap, Sebastian Vettel passed Lewis Hamilton, with help from the lapped Kubica, seemingly taking the championship chance from the McLaren driver.

However, in the short straight before the final corner "Juncao",Timo Glock lost traction due to being on dry weather tyres in the wet conditions and lost his position to Vettel. Hamilton also passed him to win the Drivers' championship of the 2008 Formula One season.

Massa missed out on the season title by just one point. Ferrari maintained the lead over McLaren to win the F1 Constructors' Championship.
