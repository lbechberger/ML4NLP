More than five years after the 11 September 2001 attacks, human remains from the World Trade Center's fallen towers have been uncovered at the cross of 29th Street and 11th Avenue in New York City.

Works from Manhattan's Consolidation Edison found the remains and took them to a natural gas vehicle refueling station, where they called medical examiners to the scene. It is unclear when the remains were found or what condition they are in.

An estimated 2,749 people died as a consequence of the September 11 attacks, and family members of about 1,150 victims still do not know whether the remains of victims have been, or ever will be, found.
