The New York radio station HOT 97 has apologized after one of its DJs played a song making light of the recent tsunami catastrophe in Asia.

The 'Tsunami Song' was played by 'Miss Jones' on the hip hop and R&B station's Morning show earlier this month. Miss Jones and station management later apologised on-air.

Miss Jones and the Morning team have now been suspended indefinitely.
