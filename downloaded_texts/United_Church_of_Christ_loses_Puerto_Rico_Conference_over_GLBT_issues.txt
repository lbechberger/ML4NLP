On June 10, 2006, the Iglesia Evangelica Unida de Puerto Rico, also known as the "Puerto Rico Conference " a conference of the UCC, voted by a 3-1 margin to withdraw its affiliation with the UCC as a body, over discomfort about the UCCâ€™s stance on lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender issues. . Formed in 1931, this conference affiliated with the UCC following the denominations founding in 1957. 

This vote to disaffiliate means most of the 68 previously affiliated congregations will become independent, although denominational officials expressed hope that several might continue affiliation, through other conferences or special arrangements.

In a speech, John Thomas, President of the UCC, called the vote to disaffiliate 'deeply painful.'

There are 68 congregations and 6000 members of the Iglesia Evangelica Unida de Puerto Rico. 

38 conferences remain in the United Church of Christ.
