The 2005 Melbourne Cup has been won by Makybe Diva. Second was On A Jeune and third placegetter was Xcellent.

The Melbourne Cup is the richest horse race in Australia, with prize money in 2005 of A$5,000,000, and is one of the richest horse races in the world. It is run annually on the first Tuesday of November at Flemington Racecourse in Melbourne, over a distance of 3,200 meters (which is slightly under 2 miles). An estimated crowd of 140,000 flocked to the Flemington Racecourse to watch the race.

This is the first time in the history of the race, first held in 1861, that the same horse has won the race three times. With this being the third consecutive year that Makybe Diva has won the Melbourne Cup, comparisons are now being made to legendary Australian horse Phar Lap. Four other horses have won the race twice, of which three won it in consecutive years.

Makybe Diva was ridden by Glen Boss, and was trained by Lee Freedman. Freedman said on the morning of the race that a win would be a "Herculean task" to achieve. 

The owners of Makybe Diva received A$3,000,000 in prize money, as well as trophies valued at A$100,000. A$750,000 was awarded to the second placegetter, and A$375,000 to third place, with the remaining prize money distributed amongst the fourth through the tenth placegetters.
