Barcelona defeated Arsenal to win the UEFA Champions League for the first time since 1992. They had to come from a goal down to triumph against ten-man Arsenal. Jens Lehmann became the first player to be sent off in a final through bringing down Samuel Eto'o. Sol Campbell headed Arsenal into the lead from a Thierry Henry freekick, Samuel Eto'o equalized and later Juliano Belletti scored the decisive winner for Barcelona.
