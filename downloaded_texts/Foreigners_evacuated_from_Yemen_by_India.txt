India's Ministry of External affairs yesterday announced the end of an evacuation effort which has rescued about 5,600 people from more than 40 countries from the conflict in Yemen.

To avoid a no-fly zone over parts of Yemen, India transported people via the African state of Djibouti. This was achieved using ships of the Indian Navy as transport from Aden across the Bab-el-Mandeb strait to Djibouti, and Air India planes flying from Sanaa to Djibouti, and from there onward to India.

4,600 of those evacuated in this way were Indian, with citizens of Western countries rescued, including Britain, France, and the United States among others. Three Pakistanis were also amongst those rescued by the Indian effort. The Pakistani navy rescued eleven Indians, for which Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi gave a vote of thanks.

Along with ending the evacuation, India also announced the closing of its embassy in Sanaa. Saudi Arabia has begun air strikes in the area against the Houthi rebels who have taken control of the city, in apparent support of previous President Ali Abdullah Saleh.
