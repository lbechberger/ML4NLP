Prime Minister of India Dr. Manmohan Singh and President Pervez Musharraf, who are currently attending the Non-Aligned Movement summit in Havana issued a joint statement confirming that the peace process between India and Pakistan was back on track. The two leaders spoke for over an hour in private to sort out their issues and work out a plan to recommence peace-talks, which were stalled for some time in the aftermath of the 11/7 bombings in Mumbai.

"These talks are happening in the aftermath of the Mumbai blasts. The two countries have decided to condemn terrorism in all its forms," Indian Prime Minister Singh said, while the President hailed his country's relations with India saying Mohabbat Zindabad (long live goodwill). The Foreign Secretaries of the two nations will now meet to discuss such issues as the demilitarisation of the Siachen glacier and Sir Creek and also the status of confidence building measures such as the Lahore-Amritsar bus service and the Thar Express.

The two countries have decided to form an Indian-Pakistani institution to fight and identify terrorism. The possibility of the intelligence agencies from both countries sharing information with each other is also being explored.

President Musharraf stated that "all outstanding issues including the key Kashmir factor" needed to be resolved. He also invited Dr. Singh to visit Islamabad.
