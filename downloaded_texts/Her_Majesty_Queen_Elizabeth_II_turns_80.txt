Today marks the 80th birthday of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, whose reign has lasted over 54 years.

Her Majesty became the first female to become the sovereign since Queen Victoria, who died in 1901 after a 64-year reign.

She was crowned on June 2, 1953, in Westminster Abbey. It was the first coronation that was televised live. She is Queen of sixteen independent nations known as the Commonwealth Realms, which includes the United Kingdom.

One of the most peculiar incidents of her reign was when Michael Fagan broke into Buckingham Palace and entered the Queen's bedchamber in the early hours of July 9, 1982.

The Monarchist League of New Zealand, said in a press release: “there is scarcely a single public figure who can compare with The Queen. She is universally admired and respected for her professionalism, dignity and example.”

Despite her age, royal watchers say Her Majesty will never abdicate. If Her Majesty is reigning on September 9, 2015, she will become the longest reigning monarch in British history.

Cries of “God save the Queen!” have been said across the Commonwealth today.
