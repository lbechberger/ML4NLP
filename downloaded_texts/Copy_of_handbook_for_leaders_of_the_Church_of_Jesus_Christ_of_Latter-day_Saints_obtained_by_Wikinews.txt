Wikinews has obtained a copy of volume one of the Church Handbook of Instructions of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The document, which was obtained via Wikileaks, was previously only made available to leaders of the church.


It provides information on a variety of different issues. One of these is receiving organ donations. “The decision to receive a donated organ should be made after receiving competent medical
counsel and confirmation through prayer,” says the handbook.

The handbook also explicitly bans assisted suicide. It claims that “a person who participates in euthanasia, including so-called assisted suicide, violates the commandments of God.”

The guide also mentions cremation. The guide says that “cremation is not encouraged,” although it is permitted.

The finances of the church are also discussed in the handbook. It says that "when tithes and other offerings are given to the Church, they belong to the Lord, to whom they are consecrated. These offerings include all contributions to the ward and general missionary funds." It then says that it is " therefore improper to refund missionary or other contributions to contributors." As with all other charities, the process of not returning donations complies with tax and legal requirements.
