Animal rights activists have demanded that the largest coffee chain in the United Kingdom pull a new advertising campaign because they fear that it will encourage viewers to buy monkeys as pets. The demands are likely to irritate Costa Coffee, who are determined to turn over a larger profit that their arch-rival, Starbucks. Five animal welfare groups have demanded that the advert, which features a futuristic room full of monkeys attempting to use coffee machines, be withdrawn. 

In a letter to the Rainforest Alliance, the charities say that "the use of wild animals in this way is contrary to your stance on conservation and, in particular, on rainforest species". They urged the Alliance to revoke their endorsement of Costa products unless the adverts were withdrawn. The groups also wrote to the coffee chain, saying that they hoped that Costa — which has over 1,000 outlets in the UK — would "think it appropriate to cease using primates in future productions, and make the decision to withdraw the current advert".

The pressure on the coffee giant has led to fears that the company's relationship with the Rainforest Alliance—which "works to conserve biodiversity and ensure sustainable livelihoods by transforming land-use practices, business practices and consumer behavior"—may be under threat, since animal welfare groups have complained the new advert is in breach of the Alliance's code of conduct. The television advertisement depicts a number of monkeys being unable to use coffee machines, before a Costa barista hand-makes a cup of coffee. The advert, which features a voiceover by actor Bill Nighy, aired for the first time on Friday. Within hours, animal rights campaigners had demanded it be withdrawn. Manufacturers of products endorsed by the Rainforest Alliance must prove they "are demonstrating [their demand for] goods grown and harvested with respect for people, wildlife and the environment".
