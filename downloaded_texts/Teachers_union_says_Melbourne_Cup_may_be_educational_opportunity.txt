A leading Queensland union says that the Melbourne Cup due to be run tomorrow at 3:00pm Australian Eastern Daylight Saving Time could be used as a valuable educational tool in the classroom.

The Queensland Teachers Union president Steve Ryan said that he supported staff making their own decisions on whether to watch the race but statistics principles could be taught in conjunction with showing the race.

Mr Ryan said that incorporating the Cup into the curriculum would make statistics 'real' to work with, rather than using textbook material. "It's about making subjects real and certainly that's a good example of how you can use a particular situation."

Many religious schools in Brisbane have chosen not to show the race due to gambling concerns.
