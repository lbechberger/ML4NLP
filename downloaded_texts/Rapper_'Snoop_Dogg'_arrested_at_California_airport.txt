Rap artist Snoop Dogg was arrested for possession of an illegal drug and possession of a firearm, according to police on Thursday.

The rapper's real name is Calvin Broadus. He was arrested at 3:45 p.m. on Thursday at Bob Hope Airport located in Burbank, California. Broadus paid the $35,000 bail and is expected back in Los Angeles County Superior Court on December 12, 2006.

Airport police officers stopped the artist for parking in the airport passenger loading and unloading zone. Upon conducting a search of the vehicle, the police found a gun and a quantity of marijuana inside.

Broadus' attorney, Donald Etra, stated "There was no basis for this arrest. We believe that once this is cleared up, all charges will be dismissed". Authorities in California have not yet pressed charges.

In September, Broadus attempted to carry a folding police baton onto an aircraft and was arrested at John Wayne Airport located in Orange County, California. Earlier this year, he was also cautioned for fighting in Heathrow Airport in London, England.
