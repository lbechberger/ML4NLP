The man charged with stabbing three participants at Jerusalem’s June 30 gay pride parade faces attempted murder charges.

Yishai Shlisel, an orthodox Jew, said his deep religious conviction led to his actions. "I came to murder on behalf of God. We can’t have such abomination in the country," Shlisel said during a police interrogation, according to authorities. 

The combination of police eye-witnesses, video evidence and his confession led to Shlisel being charged with three counts of attempted murder Tuesday in a Jerusalem district court. Prosecutors allege Shlisel purchased an 18-centimeter (seven inches) knife in preparation of going to the parade with the intent to kill homosexuals.

Medical authorities say the victims, two aged 18 and one aged 50, suffered light to moderate stab wounds.

Even before this knife attack, the 2005 Jerusalem gay pride parade already had an extensive legal record. Jerusalem Mayor Uri Lupolianski's previous decision to cancel the parade as inappropriate for his city was overturned in court. About 5,000 gay pride marchers and 1,000 protestors turned up for the Thursday night event.

Police temporarily halted the parade after a group of 100 orthodox Jews attempted to force their way through police barricades chanting "Gay is shame!" One man, allegedly Shlisel, did break through and stabbed three marchers. Other religious protestors against the march, including Jews, Christians and Muslims, were peaceful according to authorities.
