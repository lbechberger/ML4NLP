The Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi, at an inauguration of a hydroelectric project on Tuesday during his second visit to the Himalayan Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir, accused the neighboring nation Pakistan of waging a against India.

Prime Minister Modi was addressing Indian army and air force personnel where he said Pakistan not longer possessed the strength for a conventional war, and relied on proxy war. He also expressed his government's commitment towards the development of Ladakh region. Neither the foreign ministry nor the military of Pakistan reacted at the time to the comment on proxy war. Modi said his government means to achieve Indian defense manufacturing self-reliance.

After his election victory in May, Modi invited Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to his swearing-in ceremony, surprising various international observers and commentators. However, since this meet between the two heads of the state more than 20 ceasefire violations have occurred across the borders; India and Pakistan reached an agreement in 2003 on ceasefire at the line of control between Pakistan-controlled and India-controlled Jammu and Kashmir. Pakistan blames Indian troops for committing human rights abuses against followers of Islam in Jammu and Kashmir, whom it claims to support only politically. India rejects the accusation, and calls for Pakistan to prosecute militants based there for the 2008 Mumbai attacks, which killed over 150 people.
