On Monday, Texas police identified Rodris Webster, 25, as a person-of-interest in the recent disappearance of a 19 year-old woman. The woman, Alicia Benefield, of DeBerry, Texas, was reported missing on Friday.


Webster is described as Benefield's boyfriend. He was arrested in January and charged with aggravated assault with a deadly weapon. Benefield was the complainant in that charge according to media reports. Webster remained jailed until Benefield dropped the charge on March 5.

Police investigators inspected a trash dumpster located in the nearby town of Waskom on Sunday morning. In it they reportedly found Webster's wet, muddy with Benefield's keys in the pocket. Police interviewed Webster for 5 hours on Sunday, but released him around 6pm. The woman, still missing on Tuesday morning, is described as petite size, about 110 pounds, with a nose piercing and a tattoo on one arm saying "Wanda Ree". She was last seen wearing a white sweater and brown tights. 

A police official told reporters Webster had not confessed to any criminal activity: "The story is out there that he has confessed and we do not have a confession". Benefield's mother told reporters she expects her daughter to call her. "She is going to call. I'm going to be the first one she calls, matter of fact. I don't care how mad she think[s] I am. She's going to call me."
