The British soldier who was killed in southern Afghanistan yesterday has today been named by the Ministry of Defence. 

Cpl Bryan Budd, of the 3rd Battalion of the Parachute Regiment, was killed in Helmand province at about noon local time during a gun battle with Taliban forces in the volatile area. 

"Cpl Budd died as a result of injuries sustained during the contact. Three other British soldiers received minor injuries," said an MoD spokesman. 

So far, twenty British armed forces personnel have died in Afghanistan since 2001.

Yesterday, Defence Secretary Des Browne said: "I was deeply saddened to be informed of the death today of a British soldier and the injuries of three others as they supported the NATO mission in Afghanistan. I wish to express my sincere condolences to their families and friends. My thoughts are with them at this difficult time."
