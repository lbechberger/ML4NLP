At least eight people have died when a bus fell off a cliff in southern Albania. 

The bus crashed 300-feet off of the cliff during a rain storm during a journey from Tirana, Albania to Athens, Greece. Albanian Health Minister Petrit Vasili told media that 41 people are reported to have been injured, five of them seriously.

Shkelqim Pashaj, a spokesman for the fire brigade, said that survivors have stated that the Greek-born driver had been talking on his mobile phone for the majority of the journey. Other survivors spoke to local journalists and asserted that he had been "driving erratically". An Albanian police statement has stated that the bus crashed over the cliff after the driver lost control.

Both the Albanian and Greek police are involved in the situation. Around 100 emergency service officials were assisting in recovering victims from the crash site. The Greek police have released a statement saying that the bus belongs to a Greek long distance bus company. The crash is due to be investigated.
