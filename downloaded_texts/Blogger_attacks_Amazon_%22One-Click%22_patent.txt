A lone blogger has recently mailed a request for re-examination of the Amazon "One-Click" shopping patent to the US Patent Office. As prior art, he is using an early e-commerce patent and some information about DigiCash from sources such as the Wayback machine, which ironically uses data from Alexa (wholly owned by Amazon).

He is asking others to submit additional prior art and points out that there may be other prior art that can be found. He is also looking for donations to cover some of his costs such as the USD $2,520 reexamination fee.
