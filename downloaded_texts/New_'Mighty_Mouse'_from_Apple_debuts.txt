Apple Computer Inc. today revealed a new product named Mighty Mouse. The mouse has four buttons and a small 360 degree scroll trackball. This product will not only be compatible with the Macintosh but also with Microsoft Windows operating systems.

Many of the products Apple has produced over recent years have been compatible with Microsoft Windows operating systems, the most notable being the iPod. The company recently announced that they will start using Intel microprocessors in their computers, and that those computers will be capable of running Microsoft Windows operating systems.

Visually, this new mouse will be very similar to the ones that have been shipping with Macintosh computers for some time. It is white and has a rounded feel to it. The only difference is the trackball used for scrolling through documents and web pages.

This is the first mouse product made by Apple that has a multi-button function. There are 'squeeze' buttons on the sides and a button under the micro-trackball, but there are no actual left/right buttons - it uses non-mechanical sensors to detect which finger is pressing when a regular click is made.

Its US price is $49, UK price is Â£35.
