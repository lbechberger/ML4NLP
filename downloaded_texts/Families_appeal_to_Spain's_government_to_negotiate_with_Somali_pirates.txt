"What does this mean? It means we must remain calm. Kidnappings are complicated situations, with highs and lows, they are very difficult and stressful. But we must remain confident and calm," he said during a news conference. "If we remain calm and confident I am certain that what all Spaniards what, what the families want, what the government wants—that the hostages can return to their homes safe and sound and this kidnapping ends satisfactorily."

Families say the captured crew have "little drinking water or food,". They called for Spanish authorities to "act immediately" and "do everything possible to bring home the 36 fishermen." in a joint statement. "We demand that all the parties work in the same direction" and requested that the Spanish government chooses "negotiation" as opposed to risking the life of the crew in danger by forceful means.

The pirates captured the boat on October 2, and are demanding million in ransom in addition to the release of the two captured Somalis. The crew comprises sixteen Spaniards, the crew includes eight Indonesians and members from Ghana, the Ivory Coast, Madagascar, Senegal and the Seychelles.

Spanish military captured the two suspected pirates when they left the trawler via a small boat. On Friday, Spain's secretary of state for defence, Constantino Mendez, insisted that their release "is not negotiable." He announced on Spanish National Radio that the hostages are "in good health" and that the kidnappers are "dramatising" the situation as a "negotiating tactic."

Two Spanish frigates are observing the situation off the Somali coast.
