Mullah Dadullah, also known as Mullah Dadullah Akhund, a Taliban leader, radical Islamic cleric and military commander, has been killed in southern Afghanistan after an encounter with Afghan and Allied forces, according to the Afghan government.

Saeed Ansari, an Afghan intelligence spokesman said, "Mullah Dadullah has been killed and his body is in Kandahar."

The governor of Kandahar, Asadullah Khalid told Reuters: "Yes, he was killed last night and right now I have his body before me." He added that Dadullah was killed in Helmand Province.

NATO spokesperson Major John Thomas confirmed that Dadullah has been killed. "We fully expect Mullah Dadullah will be replaced in time, but for now the insurgency has received a serious blow," Thomas said.

Mullah Dadullah was frequently seen in videos with a machine gun and artillery in his clerical clothing along with his turban. However, it is known that he attended madrassas before joining the fight against the Soviet forces.

Last month, Mullah Dadullah gave an interview in which he said that Osama bin Laden was alive and was coordinating the activities of the Taliban. In 2005, Mullah Dadullah vowed, "The mujahideen will not lay down their arms unless the Americans leave and an Islamic state is established."
