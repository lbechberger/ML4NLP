Members of Indian Parliament have attacked cricket coach Greg Chappell over his comments about the criticism levelled against him by certain politicians.

Chappell fuelled the controversy by making controversial statements and said that he was not surprised by the sharp criticism from the MPs over the team's poor performance in one-day international matches. He added that they were doing the "job they were paid for".

Seven Members of Parliament attacked him for his controversial statements. One of them even threatened a privilege motion against the coach.

Minister for Women and Child Development Renuka Choudhary said, "If Members of Parliament are willing, a privilege motion can be moved against Chappell,".

On Sunday, after 106-run defeat in Capetown, Chappell said that the key players are not playing well enough and that many players are out of form.
