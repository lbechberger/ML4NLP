U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice Source: Wikicommons has expressed her anger after a meeting with Sudanese President Omar Hassan al-Bashir, during which her aides and staff were mistreated by Sudanese security agents. She demanded an official apology, which was given by the foreign minister by phone an hour after the official meeting.

James Wilkinson, Ms. Rice's communications director, was shoved against a wall by guards as he tried to enter the meeting. The meeting began with 10 minutes of silence due to the security disallowing the American translator entry. Later, Andrea Mitchell of NBC News interrupted the meeting to shout a question to al-Bashir, "Why should Americans believe your promises" in regards to Darfur, when "your government is still supporting the militias?" She was then dragged forcibly from the room by two Sudanese security members; al-Bashir did not acknowledge the question.
