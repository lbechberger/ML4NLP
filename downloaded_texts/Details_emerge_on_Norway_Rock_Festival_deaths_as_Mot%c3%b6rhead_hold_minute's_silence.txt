Further details have emerged on the deaths of two people at the annual Norway Rock Festival in Kvinesdal. Eight other people were rescued unconscious from a bus at the site. Meanwhile, it has been reported that British heavy metal band Motörhead opened their performance at the festival with a minute's silence for the deceased.

The names of those killed have now been released. They are Terje Brueland, 32, and Anita Wathne, 31. As reported earlier, they were an unmarried couple and left behind three children. It is believed that the accident occurred due to carbon monoxide poisoning.

The police investigation has uncovered that the double-decker bus had been converted into a motorhome. Electricity was supplied by way of a generator, which was placed inside a locked compartment on the vehicle. Police believe that fumes from the generator leaked inside without anyone noticing, as carbon monoxide is odourless and colourless.

The problem was discovered at 2 p.m. Saturday by friends who had gone to the bus to check up on those inside. Five of the eight survivors were taken to hospital in Stavanger and two to Oslo's Ullevål University Hospital. Three remain in serious but stable condition, while two have been released.

The two killed in the bus came from Oltedal in Rogaland County, where they are reported to have a large family who are looking after their children along with friends.

The festival lasted three days and drew crowds of 5-6,000 people.
