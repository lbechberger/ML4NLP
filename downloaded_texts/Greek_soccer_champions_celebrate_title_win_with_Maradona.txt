A spectacular fiesta took place in Karaiskaki Stadium in Piraeus, Greece, when 30,000 supporters of Olympiacos F.C., along with players and team administration, celebrated their 34th Alpha Ethniki title. Guest of honour was the retired Argentinian superstar Diego Armando Maradona, who personally delivered the Cup of the Champion to the players of Olympiacos and went on stage, in the centre of the stadium, and shouted "Viva Grecia, viva Olympiacos!". 

Diego Maradona had also the opportunity to deliver a short skills demonstration with Olympiacos' Brazilian superstar, Rivaldo, on the Karaiskaki pitch - something which caused delirium within the fans' ranks. Olympiacos' season ended with a 0-0 draw against Ionikos, but this result was irrelevant, as the club was already secure, at the top of the Greek Championship table. This season, Olympiacos have accomplished the double in Greek football, winning both the Championship and the Cup competition.

As a result of its league position, Olympiakos will play in the Champions League next season, entering at the group stage.
