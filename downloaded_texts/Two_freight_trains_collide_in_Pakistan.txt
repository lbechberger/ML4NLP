At least two people were wounded after two freight trains collided with each other near Kotri in southern Pakistan today.
 
A freight train was on the track near the Kotri railway station when a Hyderabad-bound freight train coming from Karachi, loaded with oil drums, hit it and a fire broke out. Twenty eight goods wagons of the freight train carrying 1,372,000 litres of oil were derailed, and oil was spilled.

Rail traffic in both directions has been suspended on the track following this incident. Firebrigade and ambulance immediately reached the spot while Pakistan Railway's emergency relief train has left Karachi towards the spot.
