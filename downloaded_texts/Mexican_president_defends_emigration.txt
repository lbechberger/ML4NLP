President of Mexico Vicente Fox spoke out on Friday in defense of Mexican workers headed North. Fox claimed that United States actions to halt illegal immigration are a step back from bilateral relations. Fox also said that the anti-immigration movement building in America is not "the road we should be building between friends and partners." 

In the past year, U.S. Senators John McCain and Edward Kennedy have proposed a bill that would allow illegal immigrants to obtain legal jobs and provide the option of becoming U.S. citizens. Others are proposing bills that would step up funding for border security and require U.S. government-issued I.D. cards.
