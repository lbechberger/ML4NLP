A woman from Limerick, in the Republic of Ireland
, has won a record European lottery win on the EuroMillions cross-European lottery draw. Delores McNamara won â‚¬115.6 million, tax-free in the game, after the jackpot had rolled over un-won for 9 weeks.

The Garryowen woman will have to wait until at least Tuesday, August 2nd, to claim her winnings, as the Irish National Lottery offices are closed for the August Bank Holiday.
