NATO has said that Afghan and international forces have killed more than 130 insurgents, including eight Taliban leaders, in an offensive in northern Kunduz province recently.

In a statement on Monday, NATO said that international forces carried out the operation in Chahar Dara district last week "to stop insurgent activity and weapons trafficking."

The alliance says more than 750 Afghan and NATO forces took part in the mission, and that it disrupted a shadow government set up by insurgents in the province. NATO says no civilians or military personnel were killed during the nearly week long offensive.

A spokesman for the Taliban, however, called the death toll "propaganda", and asserted that only five Taliban members were killed.
