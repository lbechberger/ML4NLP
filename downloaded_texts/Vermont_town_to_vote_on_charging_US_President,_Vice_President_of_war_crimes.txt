The town of Brattleboro known for its controversial effort in 2007 to impeach President Bush, has once again gained national attention. A petition was signed by 5% of voters from the town, or 436 signatures to charge the President and Vice President of the United States with war crimes.

Residents of the town will vote on town meeting day to decide whether to pursue charges of war crimes against both President George W. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney.

The petition read as follows:

"Shall the Selectboard instruct the Town Attorney to draft indictments against President Bush and Vice President Cheney for crimes against our Constitution, and publish said indictments for consideration by other authorities and shall it be the law of the Town of Brattleboro that the Brattleboro Police, pursuant to the above-mentioned indictments, arrest and detain George Bush and Richard Cheney in Brattleboro if they are not duly impeached, and prosecute or extradite them to other authorities that may reasonably contend to prosecute them?"
 
Officials in Brattelboro have stated that this is merely a symbolic vote, as the town and its law enforcement officers lack the power to arrest the President.
