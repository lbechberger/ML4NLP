The Irish golfer Padraig Harrington has won his first PGA Tour event, the Honda Classic at Palm Beach, Florida.

At age 33, the Irishman defeated the world's second-ranked Vijay Singh in a playoff on Sunday to claim his first win on the PGA Tour. Harrington had 11 birdies in the final round alone, putting him 9 under par, enough to secure the playoff against the Fijian.

In addition to winning the $990,000 top prize, Harrington became the first Irishman ever to win a PGA Tour event.
