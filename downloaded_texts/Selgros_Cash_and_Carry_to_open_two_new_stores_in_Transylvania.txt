German supermarket chain Selgros Cash and Carry has announed that it intends to open two new stores in Transylvania, Romania's western region this year. The two new stores will be in the cities of Cluj-Napoca and Arad, both major Transylvanian centres. The cost of building each store will come to an average of around 15 million euro, with the Cluj-Napoca store scheduled to open first.

This week, Selgros opened its eighth cash-and-carry store in Romania, in the western Transylvanian city of Oradea. The chain already operates stores three stores in Bucharest, as well as one store each in Braşov, Târgu Mureş, Constanţa and Timişoara.

After Bucharest, Transylvania is Romania's most prosperous region and has therefore been the focus of foreign investment as well as a centre for the operations of foreign companies.
