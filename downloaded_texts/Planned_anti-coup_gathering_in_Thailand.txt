There will be an anti-coup gathering at 6 p.m., Bangkok time (GMT+7), (11:00 GMT) at the Siam Paragon shopping mall in downtown Bangkok. Due to the military's ban on protests and gatherings of more than 5 people, violence is expected to erupt.

Please note that the website www.19sep.org, the homepage of the group organizing the gathering, has already been shut down by the junta.
