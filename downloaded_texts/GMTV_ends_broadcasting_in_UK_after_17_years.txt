GMTV, a breakfast television programme broadcast on ITV in the United Kingdom, finished broadcasting on Friday after broadcasting on the TV station since 1993. Andrew Castle and Emma Crosby were the hosts of the final programme, with Richard Arnold — a television critic — and weather presenter Clare Nasir also present. British music group McFly featured as guests.

At the end of the last episode, Andrew Castle commented about GMTV that "like all families there have been squabbles along the way but there has been no shortage of love, effort and perseverance, and we just want to say to the viewers who have been with us loyally for a long time, thank you so much."

A new programme, entitled Daybreak, will replace GMTV; it is expected to be broadcasting from Monday at 0600 BST (0700 UTC). The hosts will be Adrian Chiles and Christine Bleakley, both of which are former presenters of BBC One's The One Show. From 0830 BST (0930 UTC) on the same day Lorraine Kelly will become the host of her own programme.

"Daybreak plays a key part in ITV’s ongoing transformation and reflects the fact that creative renewal lies at the heart of our schedule, which is being modernised and improved under Peter Fincham," stated Alison Sharman in relation to the proposed modifications. "We want to ensure that the core audience of housewives with children keep watching but are also determined to attract new viewers to our revitalised breakfast show. As we approach the next stage of this transformational journey our newly confirmed anchors — Christine and Adrian — will be the lynchpins of Daybreak with their unique and brilliant partnership."
