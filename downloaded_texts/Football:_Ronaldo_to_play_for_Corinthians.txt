Three-time soccer world player of the year Ronaldo has agreed to return home to Brazil and join Corinthians in São Paulo.

Ronaldo (born Ronaldo Luis Nazário de Lima), 32, is coming back from a major knee injury after rupturing a tendon in his left knee nine months ago - the third such injury in his career. In June, Italian powerhouse A.C. Milan let Ronaldo go instead of resigning him as he had reached the end of his contract. Many people thought this injury could be the end of Ronaldo's career - including Ronaldo himself.

"I don't know if I will continue to play or if I will retire," Ronaldo told Gazzetta dello Sport in November. "I have not taken a decision yet. I am in no hurry to make a decision. I want to complete my recovery."

Apparently, that decision has been made. Ronaldo's agent, Fabiano Farah stated today, "We've reached a verbal agreement for Ronaldo to play there [São Paulo])."

It is unofficially believed that Ronaldo will receive a one year contract, and the Corinthians posted a statement to their website, writing: "In the next few hours, the two sides should provide the final formalities to close the deal and set a date for the presentation of the athlete."

Ronaldo has scored 319 goals in 451 appearances over seventeen seasons with PSV Eindhoven, F.C. Barcelona, Inter Milan, Real Madrid, and AC Milan.
