At least five to ten police officers in Afghanistan have been killed and at least 11 others were wounded after a suicide bombing in the southern part of the country in the town of Spin Boldak at a checkpoint.

Police officers were having lunch inside a room at the checkpoint when the bomber, who was also dressed in a police officer's uniform, walked in and detonated his explosives. At least two rooms were destroyed, according to police.

"We were eating lunch around 1330, when a suicide attacker wearing police uniform entered the post and blew himself up," said Bismillah Khan, commander of the local police in Spin Boldak who could only confirm that "five border police are killed and 11 are injured."

No one has claimed responsibility for the attack.
