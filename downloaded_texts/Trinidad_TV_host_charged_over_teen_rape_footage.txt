Ian Alleyne, host of Trinidad TV show Crime Watch, has been charged with crimes under the Sexual Offences Act after a tape purporting to show a mentally ill teenage girl being raped was allegedly broadcast last year. 

The footage allegedly was on-air thrice last October and triggered multiple complaints to police. Caribbean Communications Network's (CCN's) channel TV6 is jointly charged under the same act as Alleyne, as well as under the Telecommunications Act. Summonses were served at their Port of Spain headquarters. Alleyne was placed in custody in the same city.

Alleyne has been hospitalised following his arrest, owing to chest pains. He is due to go before a magistrate, and cannot receive bail until he does so. He is also charged with obstructing police. Police had visited CCN offices in Port of Spain twice last year seeking the tape.

Alleyne issued a message to The Trinidad Express criticising the decision not to grant him bail until he appears in court. He said it "is really a sad state of affairs on the part of the police. What have I done that they have seen it fit to ensure that I'm only granted bail before a magistrate?"
