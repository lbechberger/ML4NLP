A Blog entitled Liverpool Evil Cabal and supposedly written by insiders of the Liverpool City Council, going by the nom de guerre 'Tony Parrish', is causing a stir in the English city of Liverpool. 

The Blog is apparently blocked by the council to prevent staff from reading it during office hours. The council has also extended the block to its public access terminals in places such as libraries, affecting the Internet access of residents of Liverpool.

Liverpool City Council has often been described as a Bear pit for its volatile nature and has been anxious to throw off the image generated in the early 1980s by Militant Tendency and Derek Hatton.
