Media giant Viacom has delayed the launch of its LGBT-themed LOGO channel by more than four months, according to reports. Originally scheduled to launch Feb. 17, the new channel's debut was delayed until a planned June 30 sign on.

Part of Viacom's MTV Networks, LOGO has secured carriage on Time Warner cable in Manhattan, RCN and Atlantic Broadband. It is in final negotiations with Comcast, the nation's largest cable company, which serves the San Francisco Bay Area.

The channel's management said it will take the extra time to beef up its programming slate and sign on more carriers. LOGO already has secured the rights to such programming as Golden Globe and Emmy-winning Angels in America and films such as Far From Heaven, Philadelphia and The Birdcage. 

Original programming includes plans for a string of reality-based series and documentaries with titles such as The Relationship Show, My Fabulous Gay Wedding, and Cruise, which take place about a gay-themed ocean cruise ship.
