A seventeen-year-old boy, who has been identified as Lewis O'Brien, has been shot dead in Merseyside, England. The boy was found after police officers were called to Hathersage Road in the town of Huyton at roughly 16:00 GMT. The police had received reports of the shooting from people who lived nearby. The incident has caused the police to launch an investigation.

According to reports, O'Brien was taken to a hospital where he was pronounced dead. A Merseyside Police spokeswoman said that "the boy died shortly afterwards." She also stated that further details will not be released until a later date which was not specified.

The scene of where the shooting occurred — at the crossing of Lyme Grove and Hathersage Road — has now been cordoned off with police tape by police officers to allow forensic examinations to take place. Only people who lived very near to the scene of the crime were allowed through the area. An 18-year-old male, believed to be the gunman, was arrested shortly after the incident.
