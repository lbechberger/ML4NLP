Russian President Vladimir Putin said he will accept a nomination for Prime Minister of Russia, as Dmitry Medvedev has suggested he will do, if he wins the presidential election.

Meanwhile, the United Russia ruling party, which is backed by Putin, officially nominated Medvedev for presidency today. The intention was declared on December 10, being the long-awaited answer to the question on "Putin's successor". The next day Medvedev, who is the current deputy prime minister of the Russian government and the chairman in the board of directors of Gazprom gas giant, offered Putin the Prime Minister position in case of winning the election, which is forecasted to happen.

Today, United Russia, which has a majority in the country's lower parliament, has held its VII convention where the nomination and Putin's declared consent took place. 478 voting members backed Medvedev while one opposed. Medvedev is also backed by three other parties â€” A Just Russia, Agrarian Party of Russia and Civilian Power.

Recently there were speculations about Putin's intention to become a head of Russia and Belarus alliance, which were speedily rejected by Putin's representatives.
