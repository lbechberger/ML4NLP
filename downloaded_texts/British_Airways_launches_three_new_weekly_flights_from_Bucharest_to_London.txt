Due to greater consumer demand, British Airways announced yesterday that it would run a further three flights weekly on the route from Bucharest (Henri CoandÄƒ International) to London (Gatwick). The Bucharest-London flights will run on Monday, Thursday and Saturday, while the return flights will run on Wednesday, Friday and Sunday. The extra flights will mean that British Airways will now fly from Bucharest to London, and back, ten times a week.
