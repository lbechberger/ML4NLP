Biarritz defeated Stade Toulousain to win the 2005-06 Top 14 French rugby club championship. Biarritz was able to put the loss of the Heineken Cup final to Munster behind it and run 40 to 13 winners in France's domestic championship, claiming its second title in a row. The final was played at Stade de France in Saint-Denis on Saturday. Biarritz made it to the final by defeating USA Perpignan the previous weekend, as did Toulouse with Stade FranÃ§ais.

Biarritz entered halftime leading Toulouse nine points to six. With the scores close, the game had the potential to go either way in the second half. However, defending champion Biarritz took control. Biarritz wings Jean-Baptiste Gobelet and Sireli Bobo, centre Damien Traille, hooker Benoit August and number eight Imanol Harinordoquy all scored trys for Biarritz in the second half. With Dimitri Yachvili being successful with three conversions, as well as booting another three penalty goals, Biarrirtz stormed to victory. Toulouse was only able to put Gregory Lamboley in for their only second half try, whilst a conversion and penalty goal by Jean-Baptiste Elissalde along with a drop-goal by Frederic Michalak saw the final score at 40 points to 13. Michalak left the field around the 60th minute, which may rule him out of France's tests against the Springboks and Romania later this month.
