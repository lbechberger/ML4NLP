Two people are believed to have been killed when two light aircraft collided in mid-air, near East Midlands Airport in Leicestershire, United Kingdom. One of the aircraft crashed while making an emergency landing at the airport after suffering damage to its landing gear. The second has crashed near Blithfield Reservoir in Staffordshire, approximately 25 miles west of the airport.

An eyewitness at the airport saw a plane crash and roll onto its side while making an emergency landing with two or three wheels missing, but all aboard that plane are believed to have survived without serious injury. The pilot of the plane later reported that he hit something, but didn't know what, and that he saw burning debris below him.

Leicestershire police say that they believe that there are fatalities at the second site. Emergency services say there were two people on board, and that they fear that they will not have survived the accident. Farmer Michael Sargeant, who owns the farm where the second plane crashed said that he saw that the plane was already "almost burned out" when he arrived at the scene.

The airport was closed, with all flights to the airport being diverted to Birmingham, and Manchester. The airport has subsequently re-opened.

The airport have asked passengers with enquiries to contact the airport on 0871 919 9000 (from within the UK) or their tour operator.
