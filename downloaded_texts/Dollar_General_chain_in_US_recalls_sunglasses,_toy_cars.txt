Dollar General is the latest American company to recall unsafe Chinese-made products. All products affected by the recall contain "excessive amounts of lead" in the yellow paint.

The U.S Consumer Product Safety Commission has just recalled "pull and release" toy cars, as well as yellow children's size sunglasses.

Products affected are:
* a four pack of Super Wheels (UPC #400016576344)
* a two pack of Super Racer cars (UPC * 883788965002, 380000)
* "Time to Play Every Day" Fashion Sunglasses (UPC #400007860896, 51,000 units)

The car toys were sold at the chain's stores from April through October; the glasses were sold from March 25 through to October 2007.

Affected products should be taken from children immediately. Dollar General will provide full refunds on return.

The Goodlettsville, Tennessee-based price-point retailer chain had 8205 stores, as of June this year.
