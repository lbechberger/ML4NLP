A cool front is expected to move into Texas Thursday night, bringing an end to the recent record high temperatures. Temperatures are expected to fall to the low 60s across the area, and may reach the lower 50s for inland areas. 

There is some speculation that the low pressure area associated with the front may draw a yet-to-be-formed tropical storm in from the gulf with little to no warning, as happened with Hurricane Alicia in 1983. Experts say there is no specific reason to believe this will happen, but plan to monitor the situation.
