Former Tubes and Grateful Dead keyboardist/vocalist Vince Welnick is dead of a "probable suicide", according to the Sonoma County Sheriff/Coroner.

Welnick was found dead in his home in Forestville, California, on June 2, 2006. His cause of death is not being released at the family's request, says Coroner's Sgt. Will Wallman.

The 55-year-old musician began his professional career in his native Phoenix, Arizona, putting together a garage band called The Beans. The group moved to San Francisco in 1969 and changed its name to The Tubes, eventually releasing eight albums. Welnick was picked in 1990 to succeed the late Brent Mydland as The Grateful Dead keyboardist, and eventually moved on to solo projects. He was later elected to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

Welnick is survived by his wife, Lori.
