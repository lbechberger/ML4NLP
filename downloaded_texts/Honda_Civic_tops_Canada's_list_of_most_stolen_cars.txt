The 1999 and 2000 year model Honda Civic SiR tops the list of Canada's most stolen cars. 

Consumer popularity also assures the cars will be popular with thieves. Its the second year in a row the Honda SiR has topped the list.

Rick Dubin Vice President of Investigations for the Insurance Bureau of Canada said "The Civics are easy targets." 

Dubin said that once stolen, the cars are most often sold to "chop shops" where thieves completely dismantle the vehicles. The automobile's individual parts are worth more than the entire car. 

The sheer numbers of the cars and their lack of theft deterrent systems make them thieves' preferred choices.
