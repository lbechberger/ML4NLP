Finnish theatrical hard rock band Lordi - who are known for their 'monster' personas - have released a music video for the single Bite It Like a Bulldog. The song rose to number one on the Finnish single chart.

The song is the lead single from Deadache, Lordi's new album, which is due for release later this month. The album's musical style is described as similar to the band's previous work in that it is melodic hard rock, but with a 'rougher' quality to it and stronger horror themes. The band's keyboardist previously compared some of the music to that of Rob Zombie.

The band have also introduced new incarnations of their costumes, as they do for the release of each album. According to the group's frontman, part of the aim for the video was to showcase these to the world for the first time. "The modern horror film classics such as The Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake and Hostel were the starting points and the influence for the visual look," he told MTV.

He also explained that the intention was to produce something different with the video. "We wanted to achieve something that breaks the tradition of Lordi videos... The idea was to have a video with a not-so-simple and easily understandable storyline. We wanted the clip to focus on the feeling of the song and the new, more grotesque look of the band." The video was directed by Limppu Lindberg, who has worked on graphic design with Lordi and directed videos for Finnish metal bands such as Children of Bodom and Norther.

The video's United States TV debut will be made tonight at 11pm on MTV2â€™s Headbangers Ball.
