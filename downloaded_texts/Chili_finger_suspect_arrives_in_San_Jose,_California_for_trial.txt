Anna Ayala, the Las Vegas woman who claims she found a finger in a bowl of chili at a local Wendy's outlet, arrived in San Jose, California on Friday. Ayala was booked into the Santa Clara County jail awaiting arraignment next week. She faces multiple charges of attempted grand theft, for the finger incident, and grand theft, for an unrelated case.

San Jose law enforcement officials picked up Ayala from the Clark County Detention Center in Las Vegas at about 6:00 a.m. local time on Friday, and transported her to San Jose, arriving at 1:30 p.m local time.

"Obviously, we can't discuss the logistics as to how she was brought here but she was brought in and booked into the Santa Clara County jail without incident," San Jose Policy Officer Enrique Garcia told Knight Ridder.
