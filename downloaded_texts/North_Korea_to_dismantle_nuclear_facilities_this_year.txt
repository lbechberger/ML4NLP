North Korea has agreed to both identify and dismantle all of their nuclear facilities by the end of this year, said U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Christopher Hill. This is a step that will help normalize relations between the two governments, said Hill.

On February 13, 2007 North Korea agreed with the U.S., China, Russia, South Korea and Japan that they would dismantle their nuclear program in return for aid as well as security and diplomatic guarantees.



Kim Kye-gwan, the head of North Korea's delegation, told reporters that they had very substantive talks and that North Korea will provide a full declaration of all of their nuclear programs and will disable their nuclear programs by the end of this year.
