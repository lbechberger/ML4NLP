 A Buderim Cricket Club XI played a team of local "Politicians and Pals XII" at the Buderim Mountain State School as part of wider Australia Day celebrations. The Politicians won the match after they won the toss and batted. 

The "Politicians and Pals" team had twelve players, rather than the usual eleven, with Buderim's agreement. The club provided two-thirds of the players in the Politicians' team â€“ Queensland State Parliament Member for Buderim Steve Dickson and Sunshine Coast Councillors Ted Hangerford and Chris Thompson were the only politicians in the team.

A four over 'retirement' rule was implemented in this match. This meant that the opening batsman, who had scored 38 to that point, had to allow other team members to bat. This seemingly caused a middle order collapse with five wickets being taken in as many overs. 53 runs were scored in this time. The team managed to stabilise the innings compiling a further 130 to finish with 10 out (of 12 available batsmen) for 220 runs. 

Requiring just over eleven runs an over to win, the Cricket Club XI scored 26 off the first over. After ten overs however they were five out for 107, still needing 114 to win - a run rate of 11.4 and over. The Cricket Club XI did not make the required score of 221. After 20 overs, the were nine out for 211.
