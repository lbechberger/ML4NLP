A man spoke of his embarrassment and shock after he was mistakenly rushed into the BBC News 24 studio and interviewed live on the news channel about the Apple Corps (Beatles) vs. Apple Inc. court case. 


The producer called for the real guest, ICT expert Guy Kewney, but Guy Goma, waiting in a wrong reception area of BBC Television Centre, mistakenly heard and identified himself as Kewney. He was taken into the studio and as the presenter asked the first question, the bemused look on his face was clear to see. However, the reporter charged on anyway, embarrassing Congo-born Goma with a further two questions which he struggled through.
