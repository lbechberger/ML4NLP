According to recent polls, Australian Prime Minister John Howard's popularity has hit an all time low in response to his policies in industrial relations. This has combined with a backlash against Treasurer w:Peter Costello, after he said in an interview on Lateline that religious teachings caused children "only a little harm". This comment followed a media stunt at a major church where Mr. Costello was attempting to capture the "Religious Right" vote.

The Liberal party has hit back by calling the public reaction "Labor propaganda".
