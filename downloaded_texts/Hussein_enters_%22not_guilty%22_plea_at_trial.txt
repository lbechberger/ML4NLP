Saddam Hussein pleaded "not guilty" at the opening of the al-Dujail trial on Wednesday. The court recessed for 6 weeks during which time his defense will be prepared.

During the proceeding, Hussein argued that the judge was not appointed by him, and thus was not legitimate. "I don't acknowledge this court."

The hearing convened 22 months after Hussein's capture. A tribunal of five Iraqi judges headed by Rizgar Mohammed Amin, with the death penalty vested in them, will decide his sentence.
