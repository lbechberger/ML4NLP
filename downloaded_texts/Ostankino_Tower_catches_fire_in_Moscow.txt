Early this morning, Ostankino Tower in Moscow, Russia, caught fire for the second time since August 2000, due to sparks from welding work on a balcony which set fire to insulation. BBC News Online reported that the fire is not currently considered to have been as serious as the fire seven years ago that killed three and left homes without television for many days. Everyone present in the tower at the time was successfully evacuated. The fire was first isolated to a platform on the outside of the tower and later successfully extinguished, with no casualties or disruptions to any television signals around Moscow.
