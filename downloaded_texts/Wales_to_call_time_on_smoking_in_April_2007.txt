The Welsh Assembly Government has announced that smoking will be banned in enclosed public places on April 2, 2007. The ban will affect pubs, clubs, bars and restaurants and all other enclosed public spaces in Wales, although smoking in beer gardens etc will be at the discretion of the landlord. The ban will come into effect one month before the Welsh general election, on the same day as a similar ban in Northern Ireland and before a ban in England. Scotland already has a similar smoking ban in place. 

People lighting up after April 2, 2007 will face on the spot fines. New bilingual no smoking signs will need to be prominently displayed.
