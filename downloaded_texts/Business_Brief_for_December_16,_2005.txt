General Motors and Ford are laying off workers by the thousands and analysts predict a decline in housing production yet according to a CNN Money article labor experts and executives say there is already a shortage of workers. Retiring baby boomers plus a growing economy expected in 2006 may move the labor market in favor of job seekers. 

"I would say by the end of next year, it could take 12, 13, maybe 14 weeks to fill a spot, and that's when you'll see upward pressure on wages," said Jeff Joerres, chairman and CEO of Manpower.

Deloitte Consulting and the National Association of Manufacturers have conducted a survey finding that more than 80% of surveyed manufacturers say they are experiencing a shortage of qualified workers. 90% say they have a moderate to severe shrortage of qualified skilled workers. 83% say these shortages are affecting their production.

"They've been getting lean and pushing the efficiency envelope for a decade," Dick Kleinert, a principal with Deloitte who conducted the NAM survey, said "So in this latest survey, when we asked what was the most important factor in their success, being a low cost producer status ranked only No. 3 on the list. What ranked as No. 1 attribute was having a high performance work force."
