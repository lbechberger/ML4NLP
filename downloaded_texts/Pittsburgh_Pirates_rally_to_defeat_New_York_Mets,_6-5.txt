The Pittsburgh Pirates rallied to beat the New York Mets in the first game of a home series at PNC Park on Friday, July 8, 2005.

The Pirates went into the bottom of the 9th inning down, 5-1, and gave up the first two outs but managed to load the bases. The Mets then put in their closer, Looper, against Tike Redman. Redman, after fouling off several pitches in a 11-pitch at bat, finally hit one to bring the score to 5-3. Looper gave up 4 runs total in the bottom of the ninth, but managed to get out of the inning with the score tied. In the top of the 10th, the Pirates closer, JosÃ© Mesa, allowed no hits. Then, in the bottom of the tenth, Humberto Cota hit a line drive with men on first and second with two outs to score the winning run.
