The NCAA men's Division I basketball tournament has entered the quarterfinal, or "Elite Eight", round of play, in what is shaping up to be an exciting tournament with its fair share of upsets and underdogs.

One example of outstanding play by a low-seeded team is #7 seed West Virginia, who beat #2 seeded Wake Forest in a double overtime game in which junior guard Mike Gansey poured in 29 points, many late in the game.

West Virginia plays #4 seed Louisville at 4:40 PM EST tonight, while #3 seed Arizona plays #1 seed Illinois at 7:05 PM EST.
