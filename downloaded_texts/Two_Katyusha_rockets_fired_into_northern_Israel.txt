Reports say that at least two Katyusha Rockets fired from Taibeh Lebanon, have landed inside northern Israel in the town of Kiryat Shmona. There were no injuries or deaths reported, but a car was damaged.

"Two Katyusha rockets landed in Kiryat Shmona, and caused damage to a vehicle and roads. There were no injuries. Bomb disposal experts are examining the damage caused," said a spokesman for the local police department.

Almost a year ago, Hezbollah militants fired nearly 4,000 thousand rockets into Israel for almost a month, but police and the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) do not believe Hezbollah is responsible for this attack, instead it is reported that Palestinian militants are responsible.

Kiryat Shmona and other towns and cities in northern Israel have been placed on high alert.
