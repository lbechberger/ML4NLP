Republic of Montenegro became 192nd member state of the United Nations, following a vote in the General Assembly.

After the protocol officers had escorted the Montenegrin delegation to their seats in the Assembly, flag-raising ceremony took place in front of UN headquarters in New York City. Secretary-General Kofi Annan welcomed the newest member by praising non-violent and democratic process that gained Montenegro its independence from state union of Serbia and Montenegro, through an independence referendum, on May 22, 2006.

Montenegro is the latest country to be admitted to the UN, following the international recognition of East Timor in 2002.
