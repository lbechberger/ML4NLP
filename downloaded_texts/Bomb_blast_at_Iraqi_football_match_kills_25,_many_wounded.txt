Multiple bomb explosions hit a football match in northern Iraq earlier today, killing at least 25 people and injuring at least 120 more.

The incident occurred in Tal Afar, a town located approximately sixty kilometres west of Mosul. According to a local security official, a car bomb was detonated at around 18.00 local time (15.00 UTC), near some spectators; as the crowd fled, two suicide bombers blew up vests with explosives.

Many of the wounded had to be transported 95 kilometres away, to Dahuk, because local hospitals were filled to capacity.

Hussein Nashad was a witness to the incident.He recounted his experiences to the Agence France-Presse news service: "Many people were gathered to watch the match. We heard a loud explosion and the people behind me shielded me from the shrapnel. I ran away, but then I heard someone shout 'Allahu-akbar' [God is greatest], and then there was another explosion."

This attack comes four days after multiple attacks throughout Iraq, attributed to al-Qaeda, killed 100 ten people in the deadliest violence of the year.

Nobody has yet claimed responsibility for this incident, although a correspondent for Al Jazeera says that "authorities are pointing the finger at al-Qaeda".
