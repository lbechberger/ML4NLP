A student carrying a long bag and wearing military clothing prompted a massive police response at Montreal, Canada's Concordia University on Tuesday. Many police vehicles swarmed the Loyola campus, but the only weapon discovered by officers was a stick used for martial arts purposes.

The incident brought back memories of Montreal's history of campus shootings. In 1992, a Concordia professor shot four people to death on the campus. In 1989 Marc LÃ©pine killed 14 woman during the Ecole Polytechnique Massacre. More recently, in September 2006, one student died when a gunman attacked Dawson College.
