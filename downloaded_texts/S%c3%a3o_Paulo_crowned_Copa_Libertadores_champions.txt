São Paulo has won the Copa Libertadores de América competition, beating Atlético Paranaense in the second round of the Final match at home with a score of 4-0. The first round between the Brazilian teams was drawn 1-1 at Atletico's stadium.

Amoroso opened the scoring for Sao Paolo in the 17th minute. On the 45th minute, as the game approached half time, Atletico were awarded a controversial penalty, however, fate would fall Sao Paolo's way as Atletico missed their chance to draw the game level.

Fabao scored a wonder goal for Sao Paolo in the 53rd minute to make it 2-0, and by now, Atletico seemed out of it.

Luizao &amp; Diego Tardelli completed the 4-0 drubbing late on, in what could have been a momentous night for Atletico, turned horribly wrong. 

Sao Paolo came out winners and are crowned South American champions for the 2004/2005 season. Sao Paolo will go on to face Liverpool later this year to decide the World Club Championship. Liverpool is this season's European champions.
