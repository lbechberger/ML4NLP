The city of Bathurst, home of the Mount Panorama race circuit in Central Western New South Wales will host a "fitting tribute" to motor sport legend Peter Brock, according to Bathurst Mayor Norm Mann.

Brock, aged 61, died when he crashed his car during the Targa West rally in Western Australia.

Long regarded as "king of the mountain" in recognition of winning a record nine events such as the Bathurst 1000 at Mount Panorama, Brock was regarded as an icon amongst the Bathurst community.

Bathurst mayor, Norm Mann said despite Brock having never lived in Bathurst, he was an honorary citizen. "Although he is not a local resident and has never lived here, Peter Brock was very much an honorary citizen of Bathurst and has over his career had a significant impact on the lives of many people in this community â€“ our local radio station B-Rock FM is even named after him," said the mayor.

Mr Mann also said that preparations were being carried out at the National Motor Racing Museum at the foot of Mount Panorama for a display honouring the racing legend's life. The museum will also accept tributes to be passed onto the Brock family according to the Mayor.

The mayor promised that his council would host a fitting tribute to Mr Brock. "Council will make plans for a fitting tribute in honour of Peter's life and career in coming days."

Mr Mann's sentiment has been echoed by chairman of V8 Supercars Australia Tony Cochrane. Mr Cochrane said Bathurst would be the most appropriate place for a tribute to the motor racing icon. In a statement, Mr Cochrane said "The most befitting place for a tribute is Bathurst. He forged his name in motor sport on that mountain, I think the fans will come to expect something special and we will provide that. We will obviously give special thought to how we are going to do that and we will take into account the families' wishes."
