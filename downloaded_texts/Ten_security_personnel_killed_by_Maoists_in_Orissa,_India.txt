Maoist guerrillas detonated a land mine in Orissa, India today, blowing up a bus ferrying Special Operation Group (SOG) personnel of the state. At least ten were confirmed to be dead in the incident while several others were injured. State police said the attack occurred in the Koraput district of Orissa, on the east coast of India.

The land mine explosion blew up one of the three vehicles in which the security men were traveling. The jawans were from the SOG's road clearing department, and were on an operation to clear a blocked road in the state.

Deputy Inspector General of Police Sanjeeb Panda stated that, "One of the buses was blasted by the Maoists. The vehicle was completely damaged. At least 10 security personnel are confirmed dead." According to him, the death toll is expected to rise.

A short shooting battle between the Maoists and the jawans also took place according to sources. However, no further details were available.

Three security personnel were injured in the attack, and were admitted to local hospitals. A medical team accompanied by ambulances has been sent to the scene of the attack. Additional personnel have also been sent to assist the surviving jawans in the operation.
