Earlier tonight in Zurich, United States national team soccer player Abby Wambach was named 2012 FIFA World Player of the Year, soccer's yearly designation for the best women's player in the world, beating out teammate Alex Morgan and five time winner Brazilian national team member Marta.

Wambach became the first woman from the United States to win the award since Mia Hamm in 2002. Her victory came in the same year she aided her team in winning a gold medal at the 2012 Summer Olympics and where she personally contributed five goals in her team's effort. 

The men's award, the Ballon d'Or, was won by Argentinian national team player and Spanish La Liga Barcelona FC player Lionel Messi for the fourth consecutive time.
