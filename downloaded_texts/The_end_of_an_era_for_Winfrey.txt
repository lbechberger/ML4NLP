The final episode of popular US talk show The Oprah Winfrey Show was recorded yesterday, with audience members saying the host gave an emotional, yet simple farewell.

In contrast with the 25-year running afternoon show's usual proceedings, there were no special guests or surprise gifts. Instead, Winfrey sat solo on her stage in Chicago and used the time to thank her fans and to talk about her life and the importance of striving for one's goals.

Tammy Brownlee, 31, who was in the audience, said "she talked about her upbringing, and that it’s a miracle that she became the person she became". "It was just her the whole time, a recap of what she believed in, what we’ve given her as viewers and what she hopes she has given us," said Nancy Evankoe, 60, who was also present.

Although Winfrey was tearful in her farewell, she made it clear to her fans she will be back. "This is not going to be goodbye. This is the closing of one chapter and the opening of a new one."

Winfrey leaves her show to focus on her new cable channel OWN.
