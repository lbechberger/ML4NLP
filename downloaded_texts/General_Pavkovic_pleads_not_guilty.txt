Serbian general, Nebojša Pavković, pled not guilty before the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in The Hague today. Pavković is indicted on four counts of crimes against humanity and one count of violations of the laws or customs of war from January 1999 to June 1999 in Kosovo. 

After fleeing from Serbian authorities, he surrendered on April 22. Pavković's extradition was one of the conditions for confirmation of the feasibility report of accession of Serbia and Montenegro to the EU.
