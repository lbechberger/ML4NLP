United Kingdom scientists have published a report in the respected medical journal, The Lancet, indicating that those at-risk from heart disease or heart attack should receive the H1N1 flu vaccine when it becomes widely available in approximately one month.

The peer-reviewed study considered 39 prior research projects, concluding that as many as half of all flu-related deaths were the result of prior heart conditions. Among the data there were clear indications that use of a flu vaccine in at-risk patients significantly reduced the risk of heart attack as a result of a flu infection.

It is expected that around 2.5 million people in the UK will be offered a flu vaccine as they are considered at-risk. Including those with heart disease, and at risk of heart attack, asthma and diabetes sufferers will be targetted.
