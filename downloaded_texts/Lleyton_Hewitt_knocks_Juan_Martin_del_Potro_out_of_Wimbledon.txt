Unseeded Australian tennis player Lleyton Hewitt today beat the #5 seed Juan Martin del Potro at the 2009 Wimbledon Championships, which are played annually in England.

Hewitt was the 2002 champion, but in recent years has slipped down the rankings, leaving the Top 100 last year whilst suffering from a knee injury, only climbing back up to 58 currently. However, Hewitt defeated the fifth seed 6-3, 7-5, 7-5 on centre court this afternoon.

Hewitt proved to be the more agile player and appeared to be more confident on grass than del Potro.
