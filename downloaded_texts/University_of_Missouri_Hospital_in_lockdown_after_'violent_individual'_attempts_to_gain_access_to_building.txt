University Hospital on the University of Missouri campus was placed in a state of lockdown on Wednesday after a "violent individual," reported to be a murder suspect, attempted to gain access to the building. "The University Hospital was locked down at noon today. University officials have reason to believe that a violent individual may seek access to the hospital. The lockdown was initiated to ensure the safety of patients, visitors and staff," a statement from the hospital said.


It is believed that the individual, Joshua William Maylee, 23, shot and killed a 46-year-old man and injured his wife, who was transported to University Hospital. Reports suggest that the suspect may have been trying to gain access to the woman to kill her. The Fulton Sun reported that the woman is expected to make a full recovery. Sgt. Robert Bruchsaler of the Callaway County Sheriff’s Department played down the incident. "There’s no indication that he’s even in that county or anywhere near the hospital," he said. "It’s just standard procedure for the hospital to be doing what they’re doing."

Missouri University Police Department (MUPD) Chief Jack Watring said that no other buildings on the campus were affected by the disturbance. "We believe the rest of campus is safe at this time," he said. "We have no reason to believe that this individual will seek access to any other building on campus." The hospital added that all "patients, visitors and staff will have access to the hospital but will be screened as they enter and leave."
