The Indianapolis Colts beat the Jacksonville Jaguars 26-18 at ALLTEL Stadium in Jacksonville, Florida. The Colts remain undefeated 13 games into the 16-game NFL season.

Marvin Harrison caught two touchdown passes from Peyton Manning, including a 65-yard pass in the second quarter. Mike Vanderjagt kicked four field goals. The Jaguars, who were held to a single field goal in the first 3 quarters, scored two touchdowns in the last five minutes of the game.

The victory guarantees that Colts will finish with the best record in the AFC, entitling them to a bye in the first round of the playoffs, and home field advantage in the second and third rounds.

Only three other teams in NFL history have remained undefeated through the first 13 games of the season: the 1934 Chicago Bears, the 1972 Miami Dolphins, and the 1998 Denver Broncos. Only the 1972 Dolphins finished the season with perfection. They played a 14-game schedule with three playoff games, including a 14-7 win in Super Bowl VII over the Washington Redskins.

"Going 16-0 would be great, but it's not the most important thing," said Indianapolis coach Tony Dungy. "We're going to keep our mantra: one game at a time. We're going to do everything we can to beat San Diego and we're not going to look ahead."

The Colts face the San Diego Chargers next Sunday in Indianapolis.
