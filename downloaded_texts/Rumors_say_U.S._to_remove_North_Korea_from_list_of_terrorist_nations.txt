According to media agencies in North Korea, the United States will remove N. Korea from their list of countries that sponsor terrorism and lift some sanctions against the country.

"The U.S. decided to take such political and economic measures for compensation as delisting the DPRK as a terrorism sponsor and lift all sanctions," said an unnamed N. Korean spokesperson.

Despite the rumors, the U.S. State Department has denied that N. Korea will be removed form the list.

"No, they haven't been taken off the terrorism list. Getting off the list will depend on further denuclearization. They know what these steps are," said Christopher Hill, the State Department's Assistant Secretary.
