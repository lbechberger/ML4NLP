A group of researchers have teamed up with the University of Queensland have begun a study olanning to predict the future of the Great Barrier Reef by studying its past. 

The research aims to be able to predict just how the reef will react to different environmental changes over the next 30 years by studying the changes and adaptations that have been made by the reef itself in the past. 

When speaking with the University of Queensland, the projects co leader professor Gregg Webb of UQ’s School of Earth Sciences said “The project is producing significant new data to help us understand the recent history of the Great Barrier Reef and so predict future reef responses to environmental change. Despite the great amount and variety of research carried out in the southern Great Barrier Reef, especially on Heron and One Tree reefs, very little is known about how these reefs responded to changing sea levels and climate in the past.”

By being able to predict just hwo the reef and its ennviroments will react to change the researchers hope they will be able to further protect it from any major dmage going into the future. 

Back in May of this year it was decided by UNESCO that the reef was not ‘endangered’ despite the fact that the 50.7% of the reefs coral has been lost in the last 26 years alone.

Professor Webb continued saying “Importantly, the research is not only unlocking the history of modern reef growth, but we were able to recover soils from the interval when the reefs were exposed, and below that, even more ancient reef rock (about 120,000-130,000 years old) from the last time the shelf was flooded. Only through the recovery of core samples can that history be studied and understood, but coring is a very difficult and specialised operation, especially within the constraints of environmentally sensitive areas like coral reefs.”
