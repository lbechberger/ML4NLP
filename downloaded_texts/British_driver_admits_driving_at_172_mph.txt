Timothy Brady has admitted to a charge of driving at 172 mph (276.8 kmph) on a British A road. The 33-year-old was caught driving his Porsche 911 on the A420 during a routine speed check by Thames Valley Police near Oxford. Mr Brady admitted the charge at the hearing taking place at Oxford Crown Court. 

Mr Brady was clocked by police on a bridge and was later arrested four miles down the road after police used a car to block the road.

The speed is thought to be the highest ever recorded on a British road and is 100 mph over the legal limit of 70 mph. Campaigners from Brake, a road safety charity, told the BBC that the offence was "shocking". 

He is likely to receive a jail term and be disqualified from driving. The previous record was set by Jason McAllister, a car dealer from Aberdeen who was clocked doing 156.7 mph in his BMW M3.
