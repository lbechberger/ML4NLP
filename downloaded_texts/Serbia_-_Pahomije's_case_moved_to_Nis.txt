The case of a Serbian diocesan Tomislav Gačić (also known by his Christian name Pahomije), accused of molesting four boys, will be moved to a municipal court in Niš. The supreme court in Serbia accepted a plea by prosecution in Vranje, which said that they are under a big pressure of the public and media.

Sanja Pejović and Vladimir Ristić, attorneys of the accused, asked for the exemption of all judges of municipal and district courts in Vranje because of their bias. Attorneys of the four boys said that this was a move to palliate the case.

The Serbian Orthodox Church did not make a statement regarding this case, that is now in its third year.
