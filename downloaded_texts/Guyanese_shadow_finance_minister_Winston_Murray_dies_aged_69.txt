The Guyanese shadow minister of finance Winston Murray has died at the age of 69. Murray died on Monday at Georgetown Public Hospital after collapsing on November 11. His death was announced by Ronald Austin, one of Murray's colleagues. Murray was also the former Deputy Prime Minister of Guyana.

Murray collapsed while standing in a queue in East Bank Demerara only hours after giving a speech about royalties being taken from mining on Amerindian land. He was then driven to a local hospital by a citizen. He was later transferred to the Georgetown Public Hospital where he was placed on to a life support machine.

President Bharrat Jagdeo paid tribute to Murray. He said “I wish on behalf of the Government of Guyana, and on my own personal behalf, to express our sadness on the passing of the Honourable Winston Murray, Member of Parliament and a former Deputy Prime Minister. Mr. Murray’s passing has robbed this country and especially the National Assembly of an articulate and intelligent debater whose presentations in the House were always of an exceptionally high standard. He was an outstanding Guyanese and fine human being, resolute and firm in his convictions."

Murray is survived by his wife Marva and their three children.
