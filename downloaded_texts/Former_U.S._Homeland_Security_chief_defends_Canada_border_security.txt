In a speech to business leaders in Toronto, Canada Wednesday, Former Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge contradicted a view that the Canadian border security system is weak. Rather, he praised the role of Canada in protecting the U.S./Canadian border.

"I don't accept the thesis that Canada is lenient or hasn't done what it needs to do to advance their interest and doing their share to combat terrorism... The law enforcement and intelligence community collaboration is excellent."

The U.S. border with Canada is 4,000 miles long, twice as long as its border with Mexico.

Since September 11, 2001, $8 billion has been spent by Canada on border security improvements. Canada plans to spend an additional $1 billion in the coming year.
