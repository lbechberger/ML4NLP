Tuesday, Prime Minister Stephen Harper was filming a cameo appearance on the popular sitcom Corner Gas. Corner Gas is filmed about 40 km south of Regina in the tiny farming community of Rouleau.

Harper was filmed in a scene where he was surrounded by a large group of actors playing reporters and photographers. After completing the scene, he got back into his car and a motorcade left the town, which is called Dog River on the show.

"We can't say much about cameo appearances, because they're supposed to be a surprise for the viewers, but yes, there was press scrum," Corner Gas executive producer Virginia Thompson said. "That's all I can reveal." "It works well for the show, actually ... We were told by the Prime Minister's Office that he had a sense of humour, but we thought we would wait and see and sure enough, yeah, he delivered."

When Paul Martin was the leader of the government, he had a cameo on the show last season. Saskatchewan Premier Lorne Calvert has also made an appearance on the show last season.

"The prime minister was not paid for his appearance and had other reasons for coming to Saskatchewan beyond being part of the show", said Thompson.

Reporters were kept back and not allowed to see how he performed in front of the cameras.

Harper waved goodbye to small town of Rouleau while travelling down Highway 39 away from the set after spending about 1 1/2 hours there. After, Harper planned to meet with members of his Saskatchewan caucus at a barbeque at Sherwood Forest Country Club Tuesday night. Harper is scheduled to tour the RCMP training academy in Regina today.

The episode featuring Harper will air sometime next spring.
