Armenia's president Robert Kocharyan expressed his condolences Wednesday morning to friends and families who lost their loved ones in the air crash over the Black Sea.

Early Wednesday morning, an Armenian Airbus A-320 flying from the capital of Armenia, Yerevan, to the Russian Black Sea resort of Sochi crashed with the loss of all 113 passengers and crew.

"I was deeply grieved to learn about the air crash," President Kocharyan said. "I offer my sincere condolences to the families and friends of the passengers and the crew. I assure that the families of those who died will receive the necessary assistance, and the authorities will make every effort to discover the causes of the accident."

The Russian and Armenian presidents have also announced on Wednesday that Friday, May 5th, would be a day of mourning in remembrance of the 113 people that died in the air crash.

Russian emergency services said the airliner had crashed at about six kilometers (3.7 miles) from the coast while approaching land in stormy weather.
