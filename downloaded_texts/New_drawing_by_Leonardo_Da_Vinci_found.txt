Britain's National Gallery revealed on Friday that by X-raying one of Leonardo Da Vinci's paintings, "Virgin of the Rocks", they have found a drawing beneath the surface of the painting. The drawing is of a woman who is raising her arm and looking downcast. The drawing had been previously dismissed as a mere copy of a similar drawing that is hanging in Paris' Louvre museum.
