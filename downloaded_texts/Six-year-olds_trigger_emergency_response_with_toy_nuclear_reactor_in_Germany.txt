Two six-year-old children caused emergency services to be called out in Oelde, Germany, yesterday. They had taken an old computer case, with a radioactivity symbol and warning notice that they had printed, affixed to the side, to create a "nuclear reactor".

The boys abandoned their plaything in the street to take a break at home. It was encountered by a passer-by, who called out the emergency services. The children later returned to their play to find the street cordoned off by police and fire services, who were warning surrounding residents to stay in their homes via local radio.

It was not until later, when the children's parents read news reports on the Internet of the incident, that it was realized that the children's play "nuclear reactor" had been the cause of the incident.
