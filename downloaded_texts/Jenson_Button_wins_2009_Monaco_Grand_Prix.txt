Brawn Mercedes driver Jenson Button won today's FIA Formula One 2009 Grand Prix de Monaco on the Circuit de Monaco at Monte Carlo, Monaco. This became his fifth win this season.

His teammate, Rubens Barrichello, was third on the starting grid and was able to overtake Finn Kimi Räikkönen's Ferrari prior to the first Sainte Devote corner right after the red lights came off.

Räikkönen's third for Ferrari was accompanied by Felipe Massa on the fourth place, the best result for the team so far.

Mark Webber (Red Bull-Renault), Nico Rosberg (Williams-Toyota, Fernando Alonso (Renault) and Sébastien Bourdais (Toro Rosso-Ferrari) closed the top eight.

The last driver not in a lap behind the leader was Giancarlo Fisichella, showing well for Force India.

Another winner of this season, Sebastian Vettel, crashed his Red Bull into the wall of tyres on the 15th lap going out of the race.

After the finish, Button forgot to put his car beside the second and third finishers resulting in his run from parc fermé to the main straight where he finally received his trophy from the hands of Prince Albert II.

Jenson Button strengthened his lead in the Drivers' championship to 51 points with Barrichello 16 and Vettel 28 points behind. Brawn GP now dominates the Constructors' standings with 86, more than 40 points ahead of Red Bull.

This year is the 80th anniversary of the first Monaco Grand Prix, but this one is only the 67th GP on this circuit because some years it wasn't held.
