Last night, 1 million people filed into Boston, Massachusetts to celebrate the 31st Annual First Night celebration. The people who attended the First Night celebration enjoyed live musical performances, ice sculptures, and finally, fire works.

Tonight was a great night for the ice sculptures and the people, as temperatures where around 40 degrees Fahrenheit (4 degrees Celsius).

At City Hill Plaza, Mayor Thomasn Menino made an appearance and held a countdown to noon for younger people who might not be able to stay up for the festivities that were to happen later in the night.

First Night celebrations were also held in Chatam, Fall River, New Bedford, and other towns and cities.
