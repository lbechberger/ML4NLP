A new Michael Jackson single and compilation album is going to be released in October of this year. 


"This Is It" is the name of what would have been Michael Jackson's tour, the name of his documentary film, and now a new single and compilation album — both titled "This Is It" — which will be released from his record label Sony Music Entertainment. Sony Music confirmed the plans to release the new two-disc compilation album and single. John McClain, who co-produced the album, said: "This song only defines, once again, what the world already knows — that Michael is one of God's greatest gifts."

The single will become available from October 12 this year. It is unknown when exactly it was written and recorded although it has been recently reported that he had been working with such artists as Akon and Will.i.am before his death on June 25, 2009. The track features backing vocals from Jackson's brothers and will also feature on the compilation album.

The compilation album will be released internationally on October 26 and in North America on October 27 — just one day before the documentary film will be released. The album will have two discs. The first disc will feature some of Jackson's greatest hits, with the "This Is It" single being the last song. The second disc will feature previously unreleased versions of some of the songs from the singer's catalogue of big hits. The CD will also contain a 36-page commemorative booklet featuring photos of Michael Jackson from his last "This Is It" rehearsals.
