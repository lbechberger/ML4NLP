Four explosions have rocked a brand new, soon to be online power station in Spain's Basque reigon in the city of Amorebieta. 

Shortly before the blasts, warning calls were made to Basque newspaper Gara and the Basque emergency road service known as DYA, police rushed to the scene and evacuated workers. The calls were made by the Basque separatist group ETA.

There are no confirmations of injuries or structual damage from the blasts at the moment. Spanish radio however reports that there were no injuries and some minor structual damage. Witnesses to the explosions say they were small.

Warning calls before blasts are common by ETA, usually Gara will get the call.

The plant is run by ESB International.
