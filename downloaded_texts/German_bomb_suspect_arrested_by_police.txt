Police in Germany have arrested one of two men who they suspect was involved in a failed terrorist attack. 

Authorities say the pair planted two bombs on trains last month, but they failed to detonate. The Propane gas devices was discovered in baggage on trains at Dortmund and Koblenz stations on 31 July.

The man was identified as 21 year-old Jussuf Mohammed. He was arrested at the main train station in Kiel. 

"The person appears to be one of the two suspects that have been sought since yesterday with the help of video footage that was made public," the public prosecutors' office said.
