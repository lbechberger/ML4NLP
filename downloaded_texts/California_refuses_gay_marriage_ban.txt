Two California legislative committees voted on Tuesday to reject a state constitution amendment banning gay marriage.

Republican Assemblyman Ray Haynes claimed that a proposal before the Assembly Judiciary Committee would strengthen the intent of a ballot measure that prevents the recognition of gay marriages performed out of State. The amendment was rejected.

The Senate Judiciary Committee rejected an identical measure just hours later.

However, Conservative groups say that they plan to put an initiative on the ballot in 2006 banning gay marriage in the constitution.
