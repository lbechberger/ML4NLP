In a joint statement Friday by Australian federal Roads Minister Jim Lloyd and his New South Wales counterpart Joe Tripodi said that tolls were being considered to fast track upgrades of the Pacific Highway. Over Half of the highway between the F3 freeway terminus at Beresfield on Newcastle and the Queensland border is still single carriageway.

Despite the New England Highway being the "national" highway from the F3 to Brisbane, traffic along the Pacific Highway is almost three times heavier on most sections . By 2021, traffic on the Pacific Highway is expected to rise by 35 percent.

The New South Wales Roads and Traffic Authority estimates that to complete the dual carriageway "North Coast Motorway" (Pacific Highway upgrade) by 2016 would cost $AU8 Billion. Since the major upgrades began in 1996, $AU2.2 Billion has been spent. Around 40 to 50 people die on the Pacific Highway every year.

Mr Lloyd said "If there are sections of the Pacific Highway where you can get private sector involvement, get it built quickly, provide value for money for those who wish to use it and alternative routes for those who choose not to, then I think let's go for it". The proposal could introduce tolls on some sections of the highway with other sections (that are completely publically funded) remaining toll free.


The plans have drawn mixed results from transport groups. A spokesperson for the NRMA, the largest motorist's organisation in NSW said that tolls should only be considered as a "last resort". He further added that if the only way the road could be upgraded was by use of tolls then the NRMA would agree with conditions. He said that any toll should not exceed $AU20.

Tourism and transport lobby group TTF Australia welcomed the move but warned that NSW north coast communities should not be disadvantaged through the introduction of a toll. Managing director Chris Brown said "We don't expect north coast communities to pay 10 bucks to go and get a bottle of milk".
