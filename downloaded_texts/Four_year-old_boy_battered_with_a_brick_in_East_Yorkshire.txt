In what Humberside Police are describing as a "nasty" attack, a four year-old boy was left with a fractured skull after being battered with a brick. The incident happened on wasteland close to the child's home in Hessle, East Yorkshire. 

Charlie Davis was discovered by a couple on Thursday. He was in a puddle of blood and part of his ear was hanging off; doctors at Hull Royal Infirmary later performed surgery to repair it. He is still in hospital, and doctors say that his brain is not injured, despite having a fractured skull. 

A spokeswoman from Humberside Police said: "This little boy has suffered a nasty attack and has some horrible injuries." 

Police think Charlie, who was playing with a friend, was molested by a male youth. His injuries suggest that he dragged the child across the ground, kicked him in the face, tied him to a tree and struck him with a brick. 

The police spokeswoman added that police are pursuing several lines of inquiry. "There has been information suggesting possible suspects and these form one of the lines of inquiry being pursued." 

The assault is thought to have happened before lunchtime on Thursday next to Station Road which is near the Hull to Hessle railway line. "It is currently unclear how the child got to the area. He may have gone of his own accord, he might have been chased there or he may have been taken by someone against his will," said the police spokeswoman. 

Charlie, who was meant to be going on holiday with his family today, is too disturbed to talk to detectives about the incident. The spokeswoman said: "We do understand that the victim was struck with a brick which has resulted in his injuries. But, clearly, until police can get an account from the four-year-old victim it is not possible to confirm any more details of the incident."
