Following the Wikimedia Foundation's retreat in Frankfurt am Main, Germany the Foundation made changes to the organization of the Board of Trustees. The board, which consisted of Jimmy Wales, Tim Shell, Michael Davis, Florence Nibart-Devouard and Erik MÃ¶ller voted unanimously to elect board member Nibart-Devouard as the new Chair of the Wikimedia Foundation.

Founder Jimmy Wales said, "I nominated Florence to be the Chair of the Foundation in recognition of her outstanding service for the past few years and her unsurpassed passion for our goals. Having such a trusted community representative elected as our new chair demonstrates the growth and strength of our organization."

Nibart-Devouard, 38 and currently living in Clermont-Ferrand, will still be working with Wales.
