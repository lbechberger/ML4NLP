AVM have now officially announced the recent postponing of Sivaji: The Boss to May 31, one day after saying it would be on May 26. Ayngaran have for the first time put on their website a date for the release which is also May 31. This is said to be the last postponing of the film, but due to the multiple previous postponings there is speculation about this.

When speaking to employee's in Ayngaran there seems to be a rumour that it will be released before the May 31 in the UK, this could be a possible preview show of the film.
