After six seasons, English Premier football club Liverpool F.C. and manager Rafael Benítez have parted ways. The separation was by mutual consent.

The 50-year-old Spaniard joined the club in June 2004, replacing Gerard Houllie. He had early success with the club, earning the Champions League title over A.C. Milan in 2005 and the FA Cup title the next season, before returning to the Champions League final in 2007, this time losing to A.C. Milan.

Under Benítez, Liverpool has a less than stellar home success for the club with the most major trophies in English football, finishing second in the league just once, while finishing third and fourth twice each.

Liverpool Chairman Martin Broughton thanked Benítez for his service, saying that after a seventh-place finish in the Premier League this season, it was time to move on.

"Rafa will forever be part of Liverpool folklore after bringing home the Champions League following the epic final in Istanbul but after a disappointing season both parties felt a fresh start would be best for all concerned," Broughton said, in a statement released by the club today.

"It is very sad for me to announce that I will no longer be manager of Liverpool F.C," Benítez said, in a statement released by the club. "I would like to thank all of the staff and players for their efforts.

"I'll always keep in my heart the good times I've had here, the strong and loyal support of the fans in the tough times and the love from Liverpool. I have no words to thank you enough for all these years and I am very proud to say that I was your manager.

"Thank you so much once more and always remember: You'll never walk alone."
