Two people in the Canadian Rocky Mountains were killed yesterday in an avalanche that struck an informal meeting of 200 snowmobilers. 30 others were hurt, and nineteen people were treated and released at a hospital.

According to reports, the incident occurred on Boulder Mountain near Revelstoke, British Columbia on Saturday at 15.30 local time; officials believe several more people may be trapped beneath the rubble.

"The Canadian Avalanche Centre [CAC] based in Revelstoke has had a warning for the last three weeks expressing extreme caution in the backcountry," commented Revelstoke mayor David Raven, who noted that the gathering had not been authorised. "A fresh snowfall overnight exacerbated that warning. I know people have been cautioned again and again," he said to CTV Newsnet. The CAC reports that there were ten avalanches in the vicinity since Friday.

Local police conducted a room-to-room search of a nearby hotel to establish whether anybody with the group was missing. Meanwhile, rescue teams dispatched helicopters to the mountain to see if it was safe to launch a more thorough ground search.
