The Liberal/National party coalition has gained support in New South Wales the latest Newspoll says.

Primary support for the coalition rose five points to 43 percent, while the ALP's support fell four points to 34 percent. On a two-party preferred basis (where the minor parties are excluded from the polling) coalition support is at 52 percent.

The results are the lowest for the ALP in twelve months and the first time the coalition has polled ahead of the ALP since the departure of Bob Carr as premier. 

Morris Iemma remains the more popular choice for premier with 40 percent support to Peter Debnam's 18.

The results indicate voter backlash over a series of errors made by the Iemma government. These include anger over secret dealings with the Cross City Tunnel, plans for a desalination plant, a sharp decline in public services and budget blunders.

The next state election is due to be held in 2007.
