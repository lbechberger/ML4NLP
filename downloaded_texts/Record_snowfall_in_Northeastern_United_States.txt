The National Weather Service announced that some 27 inches of snow was measured at 4:10 p.m. EST at Central Park in New York City today, breaking a record set in 1947. This after a day of snowfall and storms in the Northeastern United States.

The poor weather conditions prompted the shutdown of LaGuardia, John F. Kennedy, and Newark International Airports. Delta Airlines also canceled flights in and out of Washington, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Providence, and Hartford. In Massachusetts, heavy snow and blizzard warnings were in effect as visibility had been greatly hindered by the falling snow. There were other reports of near-blizzard conditions in parts of Connecticut, and Rhode Island.

Adding to the storm, wind gusts as high as 60 mph in New England prompted concerns over coastal flooding.

In New York City, Department of Transportation employees worked a twelve-hour overtime shift to salt and plow the snow from streets and highways. Alternate-side of the street parking regulations are suspended, but not the city's public schools, much to the chagrin of New York's children.

Although the streets are navigable, the Long Island Rail Road (LIRR) is a different story: Service between Jamaica and Penn Stations remains suspended, as is service along the Port Washington and Hempstead branches. Additionally, all running branches are expected to be running with 30 minute delays. The MTA Subways will cross-honor LIRR tickets, so customers will be able to take the E train from Jamaica instead.
