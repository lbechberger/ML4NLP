In a nonbinding resolution, the U.S. House voted 256-153 that an "arbitrary date for withdrawal or redeployment" of U.S. troops is not in the nation's best interest. The resolution also declared the Iraq War as part the global war on terrorism. 24 representatives did not vote on the resolution.

John Boehner, Republican House Majority Leader, said, "Retreat is not an option in Iraq. Achieving victory is our only option, for the American people and our kids."

Nancy Pelosi, Democrat House Minority Leader, disagreed saying, "Stay the course? I don't think so Mr President. It's time to face the facts. The war in Iraq has been a mistake, I say, a grotesque mistake."

Despite Pelosi's opposition to the resolution, 42 Democrats voted in favour of the resolution.

Yesterday the U.S. Senate rejected a proposal to withdraw combat troops by the end of 2006.
