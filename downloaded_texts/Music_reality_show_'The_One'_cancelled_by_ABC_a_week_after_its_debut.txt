Canada: The One: Making a Music Star was cancelled today, just over a week after its debut. Overall it aired only four episodes.

ABC's (American Broadcasting Company) show site for The One says, “There are no plans for additional episodes. Thanks to all who participated in and supported The One!”

According to an interview with the host over the phone from Hollywood on CFRB 1010 Toronto; George Stroumboulopoulos said that "he was not surprised because he thought maybe that the show's message didn't come across making viewers not understanding the show." "He also said that he is happy that he is still hosting CBC News: The Hour." Stroumboulopoulos has said, however, that he was only taking The One as a "summer job," and does not plan to stop hosting The Hour.

CBC is now considering a Canadian version of the show.

"It's too early to tell," said Kirstine Layfield, CBC's executive director of network programming. "We're not under any pressure to make immediate decisions."

Layfield said a decision would be made in a few weeks. 

If CBC goes ahead, it would launch its own Canadian version of the show this fall. 

"The Canadian version of The One is still in early development," Layfield said, adding that the CBC has learned from the American version. "We'll use that when we take a look at what we're going to be doing with the Canadian version."

The One only got 236,000 Canadians viewers for its debut episode, and pulled in 938,000 total viewers. It drew 3.2 million U.S. viewers and finished fifth in its time slot. According to Nielsen Media Research, 150,000 Canadians tuned in Tuesday nights show. 

This is the first and, so far the only version of the Operación Triunfo / Star Academy format to not be completed before the end of the series. Since ABC and Endemol were running a contest with a prize of a recording contract someone will eventually be declared "the One." Just how a winner will be declared is still being discussed.
