Today the National Archives of Australia released most of the 1976 Cabinet papers of the Fraser government revealing a plot by Palestinians to assassinate the then Israeli Ambassador to Australia and prominent supporters of Israel. 

Countering attacks in the 1976 papers was seen to require "specialist elements of the Defence Force" to be trained as police forces were seen as inadequate to the emerging threats. Reform of the Australian intelligence community was also recommended as it was seen as "fragmented, poorly coordinated and haphazardly organised."

Cabinet papers are released to the public after 30 years through the National Archives on the 1st of January.
