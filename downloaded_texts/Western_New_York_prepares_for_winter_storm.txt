Just over one month after the "Friday the 13th Snow Storm," Buffalo is preparing for another winter storm.

Forecasters at the NOAA have issued several warnings including a high wind warning until 3:00 a.m. Saturday December 2 with the possibility of winds up to and exceeding 60 miles per hour. A lakeshore flood warning has also been issued for all Western New York residents and businesses on the Lake Erie shoreline from 6:00 p.m. tonight and remains in effect until Midnight. A Flash Flood watch is also in effect, though the NOAA does not state when it expires.

A flood warning has been issued for all of Erie County and the NOAA says that flooding is possible in "urban areas and small streams." The warning expires at 4:30 p.m. [EST]. As much as 2 inches of rain has fallen in many areas and "small streams are over their banks" in some areas of Erie County.

Severe storms are also causing problems for the area. Severe storm warnings were issued for Erie County, New York and Cattaragus County, New York until 1:45 p.m., but have since been cancelled. Heavy rain and thunderstorms are expected throughout the day today before rain switches over to snow later in the evening, causing whiteout conditions as possibly damaging winds with blowing and drifting snow.
