According to a report released by the Turkish Economic and Social Studies Foundation (TESEV) for United Nation's Development Plan, the per capita GNP in Eastern Turkey, an area predominantly inhabited by Kurdish people, is as low as seven percent of that of the European Union on average. The report analyzed a region of 21 cities in Eastern Turkey*. One of the cities included in the report, Şırnak, was reported to be as poor as Botswana, Southern Africa. 

Other points highlighted in the report included:
* 60% of the population in the region was under the poverty line. If this situation persists, people may start to migrate to Northern Iraq. 
* If 1% of the national income is spent on Eastern Turkey's infrastructure and social investment for 7 years, the region will be enabled to finance itself. If the economic and social conditions in the region are fixed, the fragile relationship between the Turkish government and the Kurdish people of the region may improve. 
* Access to health services is a primary human right. Without access to health services, one cannot expect that people of this region can live in confidence. Health institutions should employ nurses who speak Kurdish so the patients can communicate with the health services staff. 
* The use of the private sector is not reliable as a solution. The government should act to remedy the lack of infrastructure in the region.
