"In Rancagua, it all was really shake-y," said Daniela Banda Sandoval, a Facebook user who commented on Pichilemu's Facebook page. "[It was felt] very strong[ly] here in Santa Cruz, in addition of being noisy, it was as strong as the [February] earthquake!," Agustín Toro Reyes said. "At least we are sure now the ONEMI's guy was awake! Jinx Arjona... drift away from Chile!," Ro Fernandez said on Pichilemu's page, referring to ONEMI's late response after the February 27 earthquake and Ricardo Arjona's announcement to visit Chile. Arjona was one of the last artists to perform on the 2010 Viña del Mar International Festival before the February earthquake.
