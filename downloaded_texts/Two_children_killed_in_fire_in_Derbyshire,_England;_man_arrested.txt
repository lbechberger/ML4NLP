Two children were killed in a "suspicious" house fire in Buxton, Derbyshire, England, on Friday evening. Police arrested a 17 year old in the early hours of Saturday morning.

During the fire, which occurred in the town of Buxton at approximately 2245 UTC on Friday, 23-year-old Fiona Adams and an eight-month-old baby successfully escaped through a first floor window, jumping down onto a child's trampoline. Both mother and child are currently in a hospital, having suffered from severe burns. The two children killed have been identified as five-year-old Niamh and two-year-old Cayden.

Assistant Chief Constable Steve Cotterill stated that police attended the house, following reports of nuisance and noise in the garden. Nothing was found, and the area has now been cordoned off as investigations continue. Cotterill said that incident had been referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission, and that "[s]omeone on the estate may well know any particular intelligence that we're after, or information which may assist us in this case. And I would offer for them to come forward to us in full confidence."

Flowers and teddy bears have now been placed at the house where the fire occurred, with one tribute reading: "Sleep with the angels little darlings. God bless." Karen Jackson, a resident of one of the nearby houses, spoke out about the family. "They were brilliant, a lovely family," she commented. "Everyone liked them, everyone. They didn't have any enemies. It's heartbreaking, I'm still in shock now. I just feel numb."
