Popular Serbian basketball player Aleksandar "Sasha" Djordjevic will play his last game in Belgrade on July 3. More then 60 players and coaches who worked with Djordjevic throughout his career will attend the game, and all ticket proceedings will go to the UNICEF "School without violence" program.

Djordjevic played in the Yugoslavian, Italian, Spanish and NBA leagues, as well as for the Yugoslavian national team. The 38 year-old won two European Championships and one World Championship. He is retireing as a player of Armani Jeans Milano and an MVP of the Lega A Basket.

"Everything hurts: my shoulder, elbow and joint. Everything ends, and so does a basketball career. They still have to invent medicines that would ease this pain," said Djordjevic.

Croatian basketball player Dino Radja decided not to come to Belgrade. He told Djordjevic that he doesn't want any booing, which would ruin the farewell game.
