On 18 October 2005 at 11 am, multi-Guinness World Record holder Suresh Joachim will attempt to break the world record for the longest time in a static cycling marathon. He will attempt to pedal on the same bicycle for 100-hours at the Metrocentre in the UK, with only 15 minutes breaks every four hours.

The current record is held jointly by Niels Rietveld and Edwin Snijders, both of the Netherlands, who set the record at Sports Studio Buiten in Almere, Netherlands. The duo cycled simultaneously for 77 hours and 15 minutes, from 30 April to 3 May 2004.

If successful in his 100-hour marathon, he will beat the previous record by 22-hours and 45-minutes. The riding will hopefully cease 22 October at 3 pm.

Suresh recently beat records for longest time ironing while standing up in Brampton, Ontario, and longest time watching television, shown on Live with Regis and Kelly in New York City. He has over thirty other records to his name. Joachim lives in Mississauga, Ontario.

Joachim's record attempts are used as fundraisers for the Universal Fund For Suffering Children.
