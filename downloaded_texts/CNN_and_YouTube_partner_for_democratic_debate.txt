CNN and YouTube have joined forces to enable YouTube users to upload videos with questions for Democratic candidates in the 2008 U.S. presidential election.

CNN will choose the "most creative and compelling videos" to air live on CNN on July 23 in Charleston, South Carolina at the South Carolina Democratic Debate to be hosted by Anderson Cooper in partnership with the South Carolina Democratic Party. 

The debate is scheduled to be held at the Citadel, and will last for two hours. 

Creators of videos chosen by CNN to air live on the show will get the chance to fly to the debate, and offer reactions on the official YouTube political blog.

CNN Washington's bureau chief, David Bohrman said that "Journalists do a really good job asking questions, but there is another world of questions out there I'd like to see. This is wide open to creativity and the use of sound and pictures. The tone and flavor will be so different from any other debate."
