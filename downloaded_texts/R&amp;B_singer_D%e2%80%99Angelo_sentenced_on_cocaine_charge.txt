Rhythm and blues artist D’Angelo was able to walk out of Judge William R. Shelton’s Chesterfield County courthouse in Virginia on Monday after being given a 3-year suspended sentence for possession of cocaine.

D’Angelo, also known as Michael Eugene Archer, 31, pleaded no contest to the charge. The appearance in court, by the now heavier-set Archer who was once known for his trim physique, was the result of a traffic stop for driving 61 mph in a 45 zone. In connection with the incident, he was also charged with driving while intoxicated (DUI), and possession of marijuana and cocaine.

Archer avoided jail time for all charges in the incident. In April, his driving privileges were suspended for one year, and he received a 90-day suspended sentence, plus a $250 fine, for the DUI conviction. On the marijuana charge, he received a $50 fine and 10-day suspended sentence.

At the time of his arrest, traces of cocaine were found on a folded dollar bill.

D’Angelo received Grammy awards for “Best Male R&amp;B Vocal Performance” and
”Best R&amp;B Album” in 2001.
