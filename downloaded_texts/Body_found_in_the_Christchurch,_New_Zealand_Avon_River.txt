Anthony James Creamer's body was found in the Christchurch Avon River on June 6.

He was a sickness beneficiary and lived in Avonside Street which is located near the Avon River.

Christchurch police Detective Inspector Malcolm Johnston said that there were no suspicious circumstances relating to the death and no suspicious injuries had been identified. However, he said it was still too early to tell the exact cause of death and police could not yet rule out foul play.

"There is no apparent suspicious injuries, but we will wait for the results of the post-mortem," Johnston said.

A member of the public spotted the body tangled in weeds in the middle of the river near Locksley Avenue, in Dallington, about noon. They flagged down a police car and the officer jumped into the river and brought it on to the riverbank. 

The body was fully clothed and early suggestions were that it had not been there long.

The autopsy should be completed by June 7.
