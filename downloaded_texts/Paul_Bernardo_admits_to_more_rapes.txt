Paul Bernardo, Canada's most notorious serial murderer, has admitted more crimes. Bernardo has admitted to raping at least ten additional women during his time as the "Scarborough Rapist."

In the early 1990s, Bernardo murdered three young women in Southern Ontario with his wife Karla Homolka. After his trial, he admitted to being the "Scarborough Rapist." Bernardo had previously claimed to have raped 15 women between 1986 and 1991. Today, his lawyer announced that he has confessed to 10 additional rapes.

Paul Bernardo is serving a life sentence as a dangerous offender. In Canada, dangerous offender status allows the courts to impose an indefinite sentence. Bernardo will almost certainly never be released.

Bernardo's wife, Karla Homolka, was released last year in what has been widely called a "Deal with the Devil". Homolka provided testimony that helped convict Bernardo, but which minimized her own participation in the murders. Investigators later discovered that Homolka had played an active role.
