Possessions that were previously seized by the Portuguese police from Robert Murat have been returned to him, despite the fact that he is still an official suspect in the case of the disappearance of three-year-old British girl Madeleine McCann. Murat described the return of the objects as "a very positive sign." The only others to be announced as official suspects (Portuguese: arguido) are Madeleine's parents Gerry and Kate McCann. 

He continued, "Why would they return something if it was in the middle of being investigated in any way, shape or form? We are very happy to have the computers back, and I hope I will have my arguido status dropped very shortly."

Madeleine McCann disappeared from the Portuguese resort of Praia da Luz in May last year. At the time of the disappearance friends and family of Murat claimed that it was impossible for him to be guilty of abducting Madeleine. His uncle described him as "so sweet and good-natured," while his cousin stated that there was "absolutely no way" he had committed the crime.

The McCann family are still appealing for information regarding the whereabouts of their daughter. On their official website an appeal reads, "Madeleine is a beautiful little person. She was a very happy and much loved little girl. We believe there is a very good chance that Madeleine is still alive. She deserves the love and security of her family. She needs to be back home with her mummy and daddy, brother and sister."
