Frieda Birnbaum, aged 60, gave birth to two sons on May 22, at 12:44 pm at Hackensack University Medical Center in Trenton, New Jersey. Both babies were delivered by Caesarean section, and each weighed 4 pounds, 11 ounces and are doing well.

"The mom is in recovery, and she and the babies are doing really well," said Nancy Radwin a spokeswoman for the medical center.

Doctors believe Birnbaum may be the oldest woman in the United States to give birth to twins. Birnbaum has been married to her husband Ken for 38 years, and underwent in-vitro fertilization last year in Cape Town, South Africa. The couple already had three children, a daughter, 29 and two sons, 6 and 33.

"This is so wonderful, I feel so relaxed. It has been a great experience. I don't feel like I'm 60. I don't know what 60 is meant to be," said Birnbaum as quoted by Newsday, who quotes FOX News.

Women giving birth this late in age, says Radwin, face high risks when they become pregnant.

"There were no guidelines of what to do and what to look for in a pregnancy at the age to 60. Can the heart or the kidneys withstand the pregnancy? It becomes a little risky to take care of this pregnancy," added Radwin.

One year ago, a now 60 year-old woman also from New Jersey named Lauren Cohen gave birth to twins. Birnbaum and Cohen became friends after Birnbaum contacted Cohen about her giving birth.

Currently, Maria del Carmen Bousada Lara, who lives in Spain, is the oldest woman in the world to give birth to twins. On December 29, 2006, she gave birth to two boys. She was 67 at the time.
