Christian Delgado Gomez, a San Antonio pilot, was sentenced to six months and forced to pay a $500 fine for smuggling four undocumented Chinese immigrants. 

The incident occurred on January 24, 2005, when Delgado was arrested at Stinson Municipal Airport in San Antonio where he landed a small aircraft he used to transport the illegal immigrants from Eagle Pass, Texas. The officers who arrested him were acting on a tip that two planes, one from Laredo and another from Eagle Pass, would be carrying illicit cargo. This coincided with a false tip that the cargo would be in coordination with a terrorist act in Boston. 

The Chinese immigrants were deported.
