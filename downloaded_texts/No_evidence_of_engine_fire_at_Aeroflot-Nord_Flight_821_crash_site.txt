Investigators have announced that there is no evidence of an engine fire in the wreckage of Aeroflot-Nord Flight 821, which crashed on September 14 in Perm, killing the 88 on board. This contradicts earlier eyewitness statements which say one engine was aflame when the Boeing 737 crashed.

Russia's Interstate Aviation Committee (MAK) says the CFM International CFM56 engines kept operating up until impact. They also confirm the plane did not break up in the air. Instead, the investigation focus has shifted to some unusual movements that Air Traffic Control records indicate were made by the pilot.

As announced earlier this week, the plane began to ascend instead of descend as it was cleared to do during final approach. After executing a missed approach procedure, the 737-500 then turned in the wrong direction before crashing.

Efforts are continuing to analyse the Cockpit Voice Recorder and Flight Data Recorder, which were heavily damaged by a post-crash fire. It is hoped they will provide an insight as in to what the crew were up to during the flight's final moments.
