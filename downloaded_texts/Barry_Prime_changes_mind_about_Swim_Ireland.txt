Having announced that Barry Prime would take over the newly created post of National Performance Director for swimming, Swim Ireland has revealed that the British coach has changed his mind about taking up the post. Speaking from his home Mr. Prime told journalists "It is with regret that I had to inform the Swim Ireland Board of my decision not to take up the position of National Performance Director." 

Barry Prime had agreed earlier this month to take over the post, but has changed his mind because he does not wish to move to Ireland from his current home in Australia. He said, "I have realized that I do not wish to leave Australia and for that reason, and that reason alone, I will not take up the post."

The loss of Mr. Prime, a seasoned professional coach at the Australian Institute of Sport, is a major blow to Swim Ireland which has struggled in recent years to adapt to changes in international swimming.
