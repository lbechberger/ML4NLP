After an unprecedented thirty hour debate in the United Kingdom between the elected government and the main opposition party, the Conservatives, the Prevention of Terrorism Bill was passed by the House of Lords. 

Despite the new legislation being passed, the Conservative leader Michael Howard claimed victory, as the Prime Minister, Tony Blair, made a last minute compromise on several details of the bill.

The lengthy debate was the third longest in the history of the House of Lords. The new bill will replace the current Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001
