U.S. Congressman Jason Altmire came out against SOPA yesterday evening at meeting with constituents in Monaca, Pennsylvania. 


The meeting at The Fountainhead Cafe was organized after proprieter John Dalton invited Congressman Altmire via Twitter.


After moderating an hour-long discussion about SOPA, file-sharing, copyright, censorship, and related topics, Altmire announced his opposition to SOPA, expressing confidence that it wouldn't move forward. He called the widespread public outcry against SOPA and PIPA "amazing", and encouraged the crowd make their voice heard on other issues as well. 

Altmire emphasized that "piracy and copyright infringement in foreign countries, especially [...] in China and southeast Asia" is a "huge issue", but that "this bill is not the answer".
