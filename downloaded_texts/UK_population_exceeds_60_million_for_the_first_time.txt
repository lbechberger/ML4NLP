The Office of National Statistics have this morning revealed figures which show the United Kingdomâ€™s population has exceeded sixty million for the first time. 

In June 2005, the number of people living in the country was 60.2 million, an increase of 0.6% since June 2004. The figures also show that there were 50.4 million people residing in England last year.

International migration played a large part in the increase, which was the largest yearly growth in population since 1962.
