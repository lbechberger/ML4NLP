After 100 days in office, United States president Barack Obama gave a speech on Wednesday, speaking about the swine influenza outbreak and the struggling economy, both described by the Los Angles Times as "two wars." He used a prime time television slot to showcase his message throughout the United States.

During his speech, he said, "If you could tell me right now when I walked into this office... that all you had to worry about was Iraq, Afghanistan, North Korea, getting healthcare passed, figuring out how to deal with energy independence, deal with Iran and a pandemic flu, I would take that deal. I would love a nice, lean portfolio to deal with, but that's not the hand that's been dealt us."

Obama also said the economy was not the only problem. There are threats to the country including "...terrorism to nuclear proliferation to pandemic flu."

Regarding the swine influenza outbreak, he said that the U.S./Mexico border will not be closed because closing the border does not fix any problems, claiming that this method did not work in the past. Instead, he said that the best method for preventing the spread of the flu is hand washing, covering one's mouth while coughing, and staying home when one feels sick. The Los Angeles Times described Obama "more like school nurse in chief than commander in chief."

On the topic of waterboarding, Obama said, "I do believe that it is torture."
