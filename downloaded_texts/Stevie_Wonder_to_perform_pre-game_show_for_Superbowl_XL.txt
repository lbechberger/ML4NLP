Stevie Wonder is slated to perform the pre-game show for Super Bowl XL on February 5, 2006. This announcement was not made by the NFL, but by Wonder's record label, Motown.

Detroit, where Super Bowl 40 is being held, is the original home of Motown, and many of its residents were upset that England's Rolling Stones would be performing the prestigious half-time show.
