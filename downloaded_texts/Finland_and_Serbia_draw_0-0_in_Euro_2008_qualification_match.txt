Finland and Serbia have drawn 0-0 in a Euro 2008 qualification match.

Serbia was dominant in the first half, but both Dejan Stankovic and Danko Lazovic failed to score despite being presented with clear opportunities. A free kick against Finland, taken by Bosko Jankovic, was also saved from becoming a goal by Finnish goalkeeper Jussi Jääskeläinen.

Finland also failed to convert opportunities into goals, with Jonatan Johansson's attempt blocked by Serbian goalkeeper Vladimir Stojkovic. Serbia also failed at one more opportunity in the second half.

Finland, second in Group A, have 18 points, but Serbia have only 15. "Not everything is lost," said Serbia striker Nikola Zigic. "Now we play Portugal and that is 'to be or not to be' match for us."
