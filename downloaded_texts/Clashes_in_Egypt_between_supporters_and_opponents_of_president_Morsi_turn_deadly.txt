At least two people in Cairo, Egypt have died after clashes at the presidential palace broke out between supporters and opponents of president Mohamed Morsi. Dozens more were injured.

On Tuesday night, opponents of Morsi set up tents and began camping outside the palace. On Wednesday, reports say supporters of Morsi stormed the encampment and tore down tents belonging to opponents and attacked them. Some threw rocks at them while others threw molotov cocktails, forcing opponents to retreat.

Protests both in support of and opposing Morsi broke out around Egypt after he enacted new powers on November 22 that include making his decisions free from judicial oversight. A referendum is to be presented on December 15 outlining a new constitution for the country.
