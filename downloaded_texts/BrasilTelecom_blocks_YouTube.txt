The largest telecom company in Brazil, BrasilTelecom, has blocked its users from accessing YouTube following a court order to shut down the popular video sharing website.

BrasilTelecom did not issue an official statement regarding YouTube, but its customers are complaining that all access to the website is blocked.

A ban on YouTube was ordered by Brazilian courts after celebrity Daniela Cicarelli sued the website for hosting unauthorized videos of her having sex on the beach. YouTube removed the videos, as is standard for videos it receives legal complaints about, but was unable to stop other users from uploading copies since it does not screen videos before they are uploaded.
