Six people, including two children, were found dead in a Memphis, Tennessee home in the United States on Monday. Three wounded children were also found at the scene, a 7-year-old boy, a 10-month-old girl and a 4-year-old whose gender was not reported, were sent to Le Bonheur Children's Medical Center. Two were last reported in very critical condition, while the other was in serious condition.

All of the victims had either gunshot or stab wounds, or both, and were all found in the same room. Its unclear as to the day it happened, but a neighboor from across the street said he heard gunshots being fired at around 8:30 p.m. on Sunday night.

The killer is still at large. "This is a stain on our community, and we really need the community's help," said Lt. Joe Scott of the Memphis Police Department at a press conference today.

"I don't know the answer," Mayor Willie Herenton told local television. "I don't think anybody knows the answer. I don't think more police officers, more jails, more people marching in the streets, praying â€” I don't think all of those things are the answers."
