Serbia and Montenegro international, Mateja Kežman, will sign a three year contract with Atlético de Madrid today. The striker spent an unsuccessful season with Chelsea and all three parties have agreed to this €7 million transfer.

Kežman started his career in Serbia and Montenegro, where he became popular while playing for Partizan, Belgrade. He was bought by the Dutch team PSV, where he was a prolific striker, setting a record number of goals per season. His year in Chelsea was not as successful, as he mostly started games as a substitute and managed to score only seven goals in official games.

Other teams that demonstrated an interest in Kežman this summer included Sevilla, Olympique de Marseille and Schalke 04.
