The London Fire Brigade are currently tackling what they have described as a "major fire" at Camden Market in London.

Early eyewitness reports state that a "strong smell of gas" and "explosions" preceded the blaze, which reportedly has a number of people trapped.

Local bar patrons have been evacuated away from the danger zone, as over 20 fire engines and about 100 firefighters attempt to contain the blaze, which has shooting flames "30 feet in the air". Nearby houses and flats are also being evacuated, and roads near the fire are also being sealed off.

London Ambulance Service reports no casualties so far.
