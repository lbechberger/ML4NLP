No one was injured when one or more pipe bombs exploded outside the Edward J. Schwartz Federal Courthouse located in San Diego, California.

The bomb exploded around 1:40 a.m. Sunday morning on May 4, 2008 and was reported by guards patrolling the building. Debris from the blast was found across the street in the AT&amp;T building eight stories above the lobby of the courthouse. Doors were blown out along with several windows, but there was no other damage.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) is investigating the incident and evidence has been sent to an FBI laboratory in Virginia for analysis.

Video footage from surrounding cameras is being analyzed, but so far there are no suspects and no one has claimed responsibility for the blast. The courthouse did not receive any threats prior to the blast. Authorities swept the areas surrounding the courthouse, but no other explosive devices were found.

The courthouse will remain closed today to repair the damage and for authorities to finish the investigation.
