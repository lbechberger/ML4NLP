Three workers have died after an explosion and fire at a Reliance Industries petrochemical plant in Nagothana, Maharashtra, India.

The fire broke out shortly after 11 a.m. in one of the facility's two linear low density poly-ethylene (LLDPE) units. The unit, which has a 60,000 tonne per anum (TPA) capacity, had been shut down 24 hours before the accident for maintenance. Several people were injured as well as the three who were killed.

There are four production units at the plant, including another LLDPE unit with a 100,000 TPA capacity. None of these were affected by the fire, which was extuinguished within minutes without material loss, and production and supply of goods will not be affected.

An investigation has been launched to determine the cause of the accident.
