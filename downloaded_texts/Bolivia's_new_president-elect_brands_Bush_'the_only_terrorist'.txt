Bolivia's new president-elect Evo Morales has branded George W. Bush a "terrorist", and has referred to Condoleezza Rice as "Mrs Condolences" in an exclusive interview for Qatar's News Channel Al-Jazeera.

Before departing for an official visit to Cuba, Morales denounced what he calls a "dirty war" undertaken by Bush against him and said that "Bush was the only terrorist because he is the only one who militarily interferes in the domestic affairs of other countries. That's state terrorism, but those who claim their rights are not terrorists", he reiterated in what has been regarded as an escalation of his anti-Washington rhetoric.

At the same time, he said in Chapare during the celebration of his victory, that the plan "zero coca" carried out by the US to eradicate coca in Bolivia is terminated. "We are winning the green battle, coca is defeating the American dollar" he said.

Venezuela's Hugo Chavez is another head of state who has previously labeled George W. Bush a "terrorist".
