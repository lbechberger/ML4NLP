A woman set off a hand grenade outside the Tajikistan Ministry of Emergencies, killing herself.

The incident, which happened on October 9, has not been claimed by any groups. It is unknown whether the attack, and two similar happenings earlier this year, were by a terrorist group. Some Western diplomats suggest the first two bombs were linked to business disputes or political vendettas.

The woman died in an ambulance, en route to the hospital. The grenade was hidden in her handbag.
