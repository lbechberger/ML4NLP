The Israeli military has denied claims that their tear gas killed a Palestinian infant on Friday. 

On Friday, the Israeli military clashed with Palestinian stone throwers in the Beit Fajjar village, south of Bethlehem. This is when the Palestinian Health Ministry alleges that the eight-month-old Ramadan Thawabta died, after he inhaled tear gas which was fired into his home. 

 The infant’s relatives also said that he suffered from a pre-existing health condition, according to an Israeli military source. Hospital sources reportedly told Reuters that the cause of his death was still unclear. 

The IDF has formally rejected the allegations, after the Spokesperson’s Unit stated that “An investigation shows that no crowd dispersal means were directly targeting the Thawabta family home. The use of gas canisters was made several dozen meters away from the family home, toward rioters who blocked the main route with rocks”. 

Ramadan Thawabta’s funeral was attended by hundreds on Saturday.
