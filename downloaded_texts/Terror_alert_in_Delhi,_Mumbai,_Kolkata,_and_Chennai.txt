The Indian Government issued a terror alert in the cities of Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata (formerly Calcutta), and Chennai (formerly Madras). This comes after several militants claiming to be the Taliban alledgedly sneaked into India to conduct suicide bombings. 

According to one source, the terrorists are planning an attack on the Bombay Stock Exchange. 

The Nuclear Plants across India received a similar alert, due to fears that terrorists would be targeting them. In addition, government offices and transportation facilities have received beefed up security. 

This alert comes after another alert a few weeks ago after a tipoff by the FBI. That alert was issued because "Taliban-trained 'fidayeen' (suicide squads) had reportedly entered the country to carry out attacks at specific iconic structures." 

India has been the site of several terrorist attacks in recent history. On November 26, another alert was issued during the one year anniversary of the Mumbai terrorist attacks for fear of another attack by militants.
