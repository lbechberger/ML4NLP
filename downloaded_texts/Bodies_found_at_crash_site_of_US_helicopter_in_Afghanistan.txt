Thirteen bodies have been found at the site where a US helicopter crashed yesterday in Afghanistan.

Seven more soldiers are unaccounted for - including soldiers who were fighting on the ground at the time of the crash

A U.S. official in Washington said on Wednesday said all aboard were presumed dead, although the US military has yet to confirm the news. 

It is understood that the CH-47 Chinook was brought down by a rocket-propelled grenade fired by members of the Taleban, as it was carrying soldiers (including US Navy Seals) into the area to fight militants.

The search and rescue operation is being hampered by poor weather, difficult terrain and by militants operating in the area. Search and rescue personnel reached the site late on Wednesday night.

"It's a search and recovery operation in a tactical environment, which means we have to ensure security throughout," U.S. military spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Jerry O'Hara said.

In other news, the US Department of Defense has announced the death of two soldiers who were killed when their AH-64D Apache attack helicopter crashed in Iraq.
