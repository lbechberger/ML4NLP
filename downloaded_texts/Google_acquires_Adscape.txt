Friday, Google, Inc. announced on its official blog that it will be acquiring in-game advertiser Adscape Media, Inc, a San Francisco, California based company. 

Ads that are placed in games through Adscape are targeted based on the plot and storyline that a gamer encounters within a game. These ads are also targeted geographically and demographically. 

Google, which is based in Mountain View, California, stated that the terms of the agreement and the price paid for Adscape will remain confidential, but the cost might be about $23 million, as informed the Red Herring magazine on 15th February. 

Adscape is now fully controlled by Google and will provide the company with its first opportunity to use in-game advertising. Google has stated that it will be working with Adscape's partners the same as the company had been before.
