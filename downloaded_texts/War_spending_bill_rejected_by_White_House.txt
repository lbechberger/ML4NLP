The White House has rejected the proposed war spending bill today, citing its reason as any timetable on the war would undermine the nation's efforts in Iraq. The Democrats proposed a bill that would give President Bush $124.2 billion dollars to fight the War in Iraq with a timetable for withdrawal that could be waived at anytime by Bush. 

 

"To say I was disappointed in the meeting is an understatement," said Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada. "I really did expect that the president would accept some accountability for what we're trying to accomplish here."

Democrats criticize the Republican party for waiving a bill that would have an optional timetable. Republicans fired back saying that even with an optional timetable, it would show the Iraqi insurgents that American willpower was weak. 

"It is clear that the difference between the president and Democrats is accountability," said Pelosi, D-California. But ultimately, she later added, "Our troops will be funded." 

House Republican leader John Boehner of Ohio fired back with accusations that Democrats are seeking "an arbitrary surrender date" and saying that the Republicans have enough votes "to sustain the president's veto on any bill."

"The American people deserve to know that the Democrats' commitment to bring this war to its responsible end has never been stronger," said Reid. "And if enough of our Republican colleagues decide to join with us, even the President of the United States will have to listen."

The Democrats plan to have another bill on Bush's desk by Memorial Day. Pelosi remarked that this one will be widely supported by Congress.
