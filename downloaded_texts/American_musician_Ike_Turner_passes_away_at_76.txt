United States musician and songwriter, Ike Turner, who was married at least 14 times, died Wednesday at his home in San Marcos, California. His wife did not give a cause of death, but mentioned that he suffered from emphysema.

Ike Turner was perhaps best known as one half of the Ike &amp; Tina Turner duo, with his former wife, Tina Turner, whom he married in Mexico in 1962. During a career that lasted half a century, Ike's repertoire included blues, soul, rock, and funk. Alongside his former wife, he was inducted to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1991 and in 2001 was inducted into the St. Louis Walk of Fame.
