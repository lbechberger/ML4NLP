In the NHL the Buffalo Sabres beat the New York Islanders 3-0 in a shutout on Thursday night to tie the NHL record for the best start to a season. The current record holders are the Toronto Maple Leafs.

"I mean, it's very exciting. I think we're all proud of what we've accomplished so far. But at the end of the day, it's not what we're aiming for down the road," said Daniel Briere, the co-captain for the Sabres.

"We want to be having these kinds of streaks in the playoffs. What we're doing now is carrying momentum. I think it will serve us well in the future, but right now we just need the points," said Ryan Miller, one of the Sabres goalies.

Currently Buffalo is 10-0-0 and is currently the top team in the NHL. They will play the Atlanta Thrashers, who trail the Sabres by only 3 points in the NHL overall, on Saturday October 28. Beginning at the end of last season, the Sabres have won 15 games in a row.
