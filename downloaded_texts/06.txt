Fans of quirky numbers everywhere celebrated recently as the clock struck 01:02:03, 04/05/06 (using the DD/MM/YY date convention). This once-in-a-century event was highlighted in advance by webloggers and websites such as Boing Boing. For countries where the MM/DD/YY convention is more common, the event happened a month ago on 5th April.

The date attracted numerous comments when posted to the news website Digg, and the special date has been mentioned by hundreds of thousands of websites, according to a Google search.

Blogger Robert Scoble exclaimed, "the things geeks care about!"

Whilst 01:02:03, 04/05/06 won't happen again for another hundred years, those who missed out might want to celebrate 06:06:06, 06/06/06 in just over a month's time, unless you're a hexakosioihexekontahexaphobic. That is, the fear of the number 666.
