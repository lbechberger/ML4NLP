The Florida Gators became the NCAA Men's Basketball champions for the second straight year Monday night, defeating the Ohio State Buckeyes 84-75 for the title. Despite Greg Oden's 25 points and 12 rebounds, Ohio State couldn't top Joakim Noah and the Gators. Said Florida guard Corey Brewer of the victory, ""This is what we're all about at the University of Florida, winning championships." The Gators became the first back-to-back champions since the Duke Blue Devils won back-to-back in 1991 and 1992.

Winning the Men's Basketball championship gives the University of Florida wins in both of the NCAA's top sporting events, basketball and football. The Gators defeated Ohio State 41-14 in the football championship in January.

Ohio State's troubles many, going just 4 for 23 from three point range in the game, and 30 for 64 on field goals. Mike Conley, Jr. added 20 points to Oden's 25, but Florida's four players scoring in double-digits were too much for the Buckeyes to overcome. The Gators went 26 of 53 from field goal range and 10 of 18 on three point attempts.
