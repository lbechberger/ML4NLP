A roadside bomb killed nine Afghan police officers earlier today, including one local commander, and another was left critically wounded. The remotely-controlled bomb attack was made on a police convoy travelling in the Bakwa district of Farah.

The district commander of Bakwa was also killed in the attack. The area lies on a major heroin smuggling route to Iran. Ministry spokesman Zemerai Bashary said that said that one of the vehicles in the convoy was destroyed in the explosion.

Taliban leaders have previously told reporters that they intend to step up attacks during the spring season and coalition commanders have asked for more troops to meet the expected escalation in fighting.

Elsewhere in the same province on Sunday, a police post was attacked by Taliban insurgents. The attack left two militants dead and one wounded.
