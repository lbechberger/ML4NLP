The Polish national team's right winger Jakub Błaszczykowski was ruled out of the Euro 2008 soccer championships late on June 5, less than three days before Poland is to take on Germany in its tournament opener. Błaszczykowski, who in his club career plays for Borussia Dortmund, renewed a hamstring strain he suffered in mid-season. 

His withdrawal leaves Poland's coach Leo Beenhakker with a serious selection headache to solve. So far he has not said how he would patch the resulting hole in his right wing.
