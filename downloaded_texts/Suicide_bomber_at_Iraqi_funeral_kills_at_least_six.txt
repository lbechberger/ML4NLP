Six people were killed and fifteen injured after a suicide bomber detonated a bomb inside a funeral tent in Iraq on Monday.

The attack occurred in the city of Haditha, about 220 kilometres from Iraq's capital of Baghdad. The bomber had been carrying an explosive belt when he entered the tent and blew it up.

The funeral had been held for a member of the tribe al-Jaghaifa, which consists primarily of members of Iraq's security forces and Sunni insurgency supporters.

Haditha is a city in Iraq's Anbar Province. It used to be a haven for Sunni insurgents, but violence there later decreased after local tribes sided with US armed forces in the war against Al-Qaeda.
