Honda have issued a recall for 646,000 cars around the world due to a potential fault that could cause a fire. The recall involves the 'Jazz' range of cars, which is known by its alternative name, Fit, in some countries.


Three incidents involving the problem , caused by a defective master switch, have been reported worldwide, two in the US and one in South Africa. In September 2009, Vanilla Nurse, a two-year old girl, was sleeping in one of the models, when the hatchback in Cape Town caught fire. Following the accident, Honda "launched an extensive investigation to determine the cause of the incident," according to a statement issued today. Although they could not isolate the cause of the fire, "the investigation has shown that water intrusion into the power window switch housing may in some instances cause a short circuit, which in exceptional circumstances may lead to potential damages". 

Just 10% of cars are expected to need new switches. The remainder will need a waterproof skirt in order to keep water out.

Rival Toyota was forced to recall vehicles on Thursday, citing floor mats that may stick accelerator pedals to the floor. There are fears that Toyota may have to widen their recall to cover up to eight million cars.
