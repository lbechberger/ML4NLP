A family of four found shot to death Friday alongside Florida's Turnpike in Fort Pierce, Florida was identified Saturday.

The bodies of Jose Luis Escobedo Jr., 28, Yessica Escobedo, 25, and their two sons, Luis Damian, 3, and Luis Julian, 4, were identified by St. Lucie County Sheriff Ken Mascara.

Sheriff's deputies are also looking for the family's car, a black 1998 Jeep Cherokee with temporary Florida licence plate M952180 in the rear window. Authorities believe that this was a suspect's car, as it was not at the victim's home, but neighbors of the family said that it was their car.

Sheriff Ken Mascara has said that the victims pulled their vehicle off the Turnpike between 1:30 and 3 a.m. when someone in the vehicle shot them and drove away.

A woman who lives across the turnpike reported hearing a series of six loud pops around 2:24 a.m. The woman and her husband looked outside, but could not see anything in the dark.

The St. Lucie County Sheriff's office has set up a tip line. Those with information are encouraged to call 1-(772)-462-3230 or 1-(800)-273-TIPS.

Sheriff Mascara said that more than 200 phone calls have come in to the tip line since they opened it up Friday afternoon.
