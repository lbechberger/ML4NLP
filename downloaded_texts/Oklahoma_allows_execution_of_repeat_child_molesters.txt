Oklahoma Governor Brad Henry signed SB 1800 that allows the death penalty or life without parole for those convicted of sexually abusing a child under the age of 14. Additionally, the bill also establishes a Child Abuse Response Team within the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation. Oklahoma has now joined Florida, Louisiana, Montana, and South Carolina to have similar measures for repeat child molestation.

Gumm, a sponsor of SB 1800, said that ensuring the safety of children is the government's greatest moral obligation. Gumm also asked "We allow the death penalty for someone who has killed a body. Why would we allow someone to escape who has killed a soul?"

One Senator argued against the bill suggesting "the healing power of forgiveness" is more important than that of the death penalty.
