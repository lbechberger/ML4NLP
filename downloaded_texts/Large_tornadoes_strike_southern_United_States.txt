Large tornadoes swept through Georgia, Alabama, and Missouri yesterday, part of a large line of storms that stretched across the United States. Thunderstorm supercells spawned dozens of tornadoes in at least 6 states; the National Weather Service received 31 reports of tornadoes in all on Thursday, March 1, 2007.

In Enterprise, Alabama, a tornado tore through Enterprise High School, leaving 8 students dead, many injured and missing. The Sumter Regional Hospital in Americus, Georgia was also hit by a tornado, killing 2 people in the area and injuring an unknown number of others; the hospital was destroyed along with many other buildings in Sumter County.

The many tornadoes are to blame for the estimated death toll which has risen to above 20. In other parts of the United States, snowstorms and torrential rain are responsible for flooding and power outages.
