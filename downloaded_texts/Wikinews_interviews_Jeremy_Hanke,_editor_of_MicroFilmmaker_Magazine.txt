Wikinews held an exclusive interview with Jeremy Hanke, editor of MicroFilmmaker Magazine. The magazine, which is free to read online, was started as a resource for the low budget moviemaker and features book, independent film, equipment and software reviews as well as articles on film distribution, special effects and lighting. 

He says that one of the goals of the magazine is to "connect low-budget filmmakers via a feeling of community, as many.....often compete so viciously against one another in film festivals for coveted “shots” with Hollywood, that they can quickly forget their similarities."

When asked if films made on a shoestring budget can really compete with those made for millions of dollars, he replied, "no…yes…and absolutely. Allow me to explain." And so he does in the interview below.
