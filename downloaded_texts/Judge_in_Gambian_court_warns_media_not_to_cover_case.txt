A judge in a Gambian court has said that any journalist who reports on the court proceedings at Kombo Central District Tribunal will face a jail sentence.

The Media Foundation for West Africa commented on actions by the judge. "It is likely that Bojang will act as both prosecutor and judge of the case, which defies the fundamental principles of justice," they said.

This move comes soon after a journalist was arrested for reporting on a murder case in Gambia.
