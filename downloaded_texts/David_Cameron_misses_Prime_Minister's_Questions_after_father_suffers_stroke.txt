British Prime Minister David Cameron today cancelled his political engagements and missed Prime Minister's Questions to be with his ill father in France. 77 year-old Ian Cameron suffered a stroke and heart complications while on holiday. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg took Cameron's place in the House of Commons to answer the questions.

A spokesman at number 10 Downing Street, the official office of the Prime Minister, said "The Prime Minister was informed this morning that his father Ian is seriously ill after suffering a stroke and heart complications while on holiday in France." Cameron made the decision to go to France after speaking to his father's doctors.

Today's session of Prime Minister's Questions is the first since Parliament rose for the summer recess at the end of July. As the Prime Minister is away, acting Labour leader Harriet Harman also stood down from question time.

Nick Clegg said in his opening statement that he wishes "the Prime Minister ... his father and his family all best wishes at this difficult time". Standing in for Harman, Jack Straw also sent the Prime Minister his best wishes and said he made "exactly the right decision" to be with his father. 

Number 10 said that Cameron's brother and sister have also travelled to France.
