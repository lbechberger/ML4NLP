For the past few months, National Geographic Kids (NGK) has been collecting used running shoes from across the United States, in hopes of creating the world's longest chain of shoes.

The record attempt organizers welcome shoes of any brand, any shapes, and any size, so long as they have laces and are meant for humans.

The collected shoes will be sorted afterwards, and Nike Reuse-A-Shoe program will take and recycle all the athletic shoes. Nike, which also donates its unusable material to the program, creates rubber surfaces for basketball and tennis courts, soccer fields, and running tracks.

Donations of shoes have been received from actress Cameron Diaz, and US Women's Soccer team players Shannon Boxx, Angela Hucles, Carli Lloyd, Lindsay Tarpley, and Cat Whitehill.

NGK, a magazine by the National Geographic Society, says that 2000 to 2500 athletic shoes contain enough material to build a basketball surface.

Shoes can be sent before January 22, 2008 to:

:: NG KIDS / Set a Guinness World Record
:: P.O. Box 98001 (RB)
:: Washington, DC 20090-8001
:: United States of America

Nike has disposal locations for shoes in Nike stores around the US, Canada, the U.K., Netherlands, Germany, Australia, and Japan. Select athletic clubs, schools and colleges also participate in "Nike Grind".
