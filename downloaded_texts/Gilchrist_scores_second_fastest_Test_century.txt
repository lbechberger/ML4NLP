Adam Gilchrist has compiled the second fastest Test match century in history during the second innings of the third 2006-07 Ashes Test match against England at the WACA ground in Perth.

The Australian reached 100 runs in 57 balls, second only to West Indian Viv Richards. Richards scored his record century off 56 balls back in the 1985-86 series against England, in the Caribbean city of St. John's, Antigua and Barbuda.

The now-third fastest century was off 67 balls by fellow Australian Jack Gregory against South Africa in Johannesburg 85 years ago.

Gilchrist reached his half-century off 40 deliveries, and then proceeded to quicken the scoring rate, including hitting English left-arm orthodox spinner Monty Panesar for 24 runs in one over - a record for the most runs scored in one over in an Ashes test.

With centuries from compatriots Michael Hussey, Michael Clarke, and large contributions from Matthew Hayden (92) and Ricky Ponting (75), Australia declared their innings late on day three at 5-527, a lead of 556. 

England require 557 to win, or need to bat for two-and-a-bit days to salvage a draw; a win to Australia will give the Ashes back to Australia after they lost them in England during 2005.
