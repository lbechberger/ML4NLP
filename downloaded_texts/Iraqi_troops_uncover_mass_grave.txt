The bodies of 22 people have been found in a mass grave according to the United States military in Iraq, in the Lake Thar Thar region of Baghdad.

The bodies, discovered by Iraqi troops working with U.S. coalition forces on Saturday, were found during an operation known as Operation Fahwat al Asad 2. Military personnel were searching for insurgents from both the ground and air, when the bodies were discovered.

The bodies have not yet been identified. Reports quote an estimate that the bodies may be three months old, and suggest that there is a possibility that the grave may be the same grave that was found in October, which contained 25 bodies.

"The Iraqi army and provincial security forces are investigating the mass grave to determine the identities of the deceased and the causes of death for notification of their families," said a statement issued by the U.S. military.
