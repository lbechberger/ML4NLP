O.J. Simpson has been arrested at the Palms Hotel and Casino on charges related to an alleged armed robbery on Thursday. Simpson is accused of taking items from memorabilia dealers at the Palace Station casino-hotel in Las Vegas. Simpson claims that the items belonged to him and were "things he hadn't seen in years or that had been stolen." Simpson denies guns were involved and that the incident was a robbery. The exact charges are currently unknown. 

Two guns have been confiscated by the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department, as well as some of the sports memorabilia. Las Vegas police Lt. Nichols said the two guns were not registered to Simpson and were not in his possession when they were seized.
