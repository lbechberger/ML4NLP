The Indian Army observed Vijay Diwas, marking the defeat of the Pakistani military and the formation of the independent state of Bangladesh (then called East Pakistan) in the 1971 Indo-Pakistan War. 

On the 16th of December, 35 years ago, 90,000 Pakistani troops deployed in Bangladesh surrendered unconditionally following a successful campaign by Indian troops and the guerilla outfit Mukti Bahini against the Yahya Khan regime in East Pakistan. 

Defence Minister A. K Antony, along with the three Service Chiefs laid wreaths at the Eternal Flame at India Gate, in honour of the country's matyrs. A programme presented by the National Cadet Corps was followed by a Tri-Service Band performance at the National Stadium. 

General Officer Commanding (GOC) of the Army's Sringar-based 15 Corps, Lt. Gen. A S Sekhon paid tribute to India's war-heroes saying, "Vijay Diwas is dedicated to the memory of soldiers who laid down their lives for the country since independence and is an echo of remembering the war martyrs." He also commended the 1971 operation as one the Indian military's most magnificent achievements.
