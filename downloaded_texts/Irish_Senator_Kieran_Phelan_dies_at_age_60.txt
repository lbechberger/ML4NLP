Irish Senator Kieran Phelan has died suddenly at the age of 60. Phelan died after falling ill in his hotel in Dublin this morning, shortly before a meeting due to be held by the Seanad.

Phelan sat on the Industrial and Commercial Panel and had been a Senator since 2002. He was also a Laois County councillor and was elected council chairman in 1998. He was a member of the Fianna Fáil party. 

Taoiseach Brain Cowen released a statement on the death of Senator Phelan. "Kieran is a well known, much admired and greatly respected member of Seanad Éireann. He is a constituency colleague of mine and a lifelong friend. I will miss him deeply," he said.

As a mark of respect, Leader of the House Donie Cassidy proposed that the house be adjourned until June 1st.
