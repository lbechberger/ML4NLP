Three teenage girls were killed in Florida after they were hit by a train while crossing a narrow bridge. The accident occurred Saturday night at around 1830 local time (2330 UTC) in Melbourne, Brevard County. The names of the girls have not been released, as the next of kin are still to be notified.

A boy had walked ahead, and successfully made his way across the bridge. When the other girls began to cross, they had not noticed a train was coming. Melbourne Police Department spokesman Lieutenant Marc Claycomb said "They were unable to get out of the way in time and they were struck by the train."

Witness John Vallee said he heard the train operated by Florida East Coast Railway make a sudden stop after the incident. He then came the the bridge and made the discovery, and called 9-1-1.

"It's tragic," Lieutenant Claycomb said. "There's no other way to put it."
