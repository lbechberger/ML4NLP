The Italian football team Inter Milan have cancelled their tour of England, where they were to play the English teams Crystal Palace, Leicester City, Portsmouth, and Norwich City. The four matches were due to take place between 25 July and 31 July. 

The cancellation of the tour has come days after a failed bomb attack on London. Only one match — the game against Crystal Palace — was to have been played in London.

Inter Milan confirmed in a statement that the attacks on London compelled the club to cancel their tour of England, saying that: "Football takes a step back because of increasing serious events which touch the sensitivity of everyone. For this reason, and given the situation, the club has decided to cancel the team's tour of England."
