led the fishermen to imprisonment in the Malir and Landhi District Jail.

Earlier during the week Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi provided his warm greeting to Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and leaders of other nations in the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation who are taking part in the 2015 Cricket World Cup. The Indian fishermen reportedly had completed the terms of their imprisonment sentences last year; Pakistan's Foreign Ministry released a statement on Monday expressing hope for release of Pakistanis whose sentences in India are complete.

India and Pakistan often imprison each other's fisherman for violating the maritime border. There are still about 350 prisoners in Pakistan's jail as of now. Pakistan arrested another 38 fishermen last month.
