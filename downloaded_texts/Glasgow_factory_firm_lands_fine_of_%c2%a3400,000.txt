The Stockline Plastics operators in Glasgow, ICL Plastics and ICL Tech, have been fined Â£400,000, for the explosion which ripped through the firm's Glasgow plant.

Nine were killed in the incident, which happened on 11 May 2004. It happened as gas from a corroded pipe installed in 1969 ignited in the cellar of the factory.

The company lawyer read a statement by the factory firm, however, when asked a question, claimed she had 'no further comments'. 

The director of the H&amp;SE in Scotland said lessons were to be learnt from this incident.
