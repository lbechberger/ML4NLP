Pat Robertson, the televangelist founder of the conservative Christian Broadcasting Network and host of The 700 Club, has apologized for his earlier controversial statement.
 
After initially denying that he called for the assassination of Hugo ChÃ¡vez, the President of Venezuela, he later apologized for the remark:

"Is it right to call for assassination? No, and I apologize for that statement", said Robertson.

On Wednesday, he initially denied having called for Chavez to be killed and said The Associated Press had misinterpreted his remarks.

"I didn't say 'assassination.' I said our special forces should 'take him out,'" Robertson said on his show. "'Take him out' could be a number of things including kidnapping."
