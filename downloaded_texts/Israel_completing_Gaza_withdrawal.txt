Israel destroyed their last remaining military facilities in the Gaza Strip today, leaving behind as few remnants of the occupation as possible. Soldiers placed explosives in the buildings, and watched as they were destroyed, sources say.

Shaul Mofaz, Israel's Defense Minister, expects the final pullout from Gaza to be completed by Monday or Tuesday. The remaining military troops in Gaza remain in military vehicles while waiting for the pullout.

It is being currently debated in the Israeli cabinet as to whether the synagogues will be demolished. The decision is expected to come on Sunday. According to Mofaz, "it is very hard for me to give the army orders to destroy and blow up Jewish synagogues." 

If the synagogues are to be destroyed, the pullout will be delayed a day, and the pullout will be completed on Tuesday. The last soldier to leave Gaza will be General Aviv Kochavi, who will lock the Kissufim gate in a symbolic event.
