Larry Robinson resigned as coach of the New Jersey Devils on Monday afternoon because of stress-related health issues. Devils president and general manager Lou Lamoriello will take over the coach position temporarily until the new coach would be brought "as soon as possible".

"Stress is a killer," Mr. Robinson said during the announcement. "I lost a dear brother last year and that changed my thoughts about life a lot. My parents are no longer around. I want to be able to enjoy my kids. I worked and I played for 20 years so I could give everything I wasn't able to have for myself to my children, and they suffered for my absence."

Robinson, who coached Devils to 2000 Stanley Cup championship and 2001 Stanley Cup Finals, returned to coach the Devils last July after Pat Burns was diagnosed with cancer.

"A lot of things were getting to me. I want this team to be successful, but if I can't be at my best and it's bothering me healthwise, I can't do that," Robinson said.

Robinson's resignation is the second NHL coaching change this season, following Eddie Olczyk's dismissal by the Pittsburgh Penguins last week.

54-year-old Robinson missed 2 games this month with flu and sinus problems, he said that he already underwent tests, including an CAT test because of continuing "horrible headaches".
