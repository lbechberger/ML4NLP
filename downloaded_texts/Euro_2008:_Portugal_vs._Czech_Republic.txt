Portugal all but secured a spot on the quarter-finals of the UEFA Euro 2008 yesterday, defeating the Czechs 3-1. This is the team's second consecutive victory in the championship. 

Portugal took an early lead in minute eight when Deco scored after two attempts. The score was equalled by the Czechs in minute 17 when Sionko headed in from a corner. Portugal then retook the lead when Ronaldo low-drived the ball into the goal after a pass from Deco. Regulation time ended, and three minutes were added, giving the Czechs a chance to equal the score, but all hope was lost when Quaresma scored one minute later, after receiving a pass from Ronaldo. 

Portugal, as the winner of Group A, will kick off the knockout stage by playing the runner up from Group B in the quarter-finals on June 19.
