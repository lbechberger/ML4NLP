A British soldier has been killed near the town of Sangin, in the Helmand Province of Afghanistan after a bomb explosion struck on Saturday afternoon. The death brings the current total of UK military personnel killed in Afghanistan up to 224 since 2001.

The soldier, who has not yet been named, was from the Royal Logistic Corps. His family has now been told of what has happened and they now ask for a 24-hour time grace period before releasing any more information. A statement released from the Ministry of Defence read: "it is with great sadness that the Ministry of Defence must confirm the death of a soldier from the Royal Logistic Corps."

Lieutenant Colonel David Wakefield OBE, a spokesperson for Task Force Helmand, also made a statement. "It is with great sadness I confirm that a soldier from the Royal Logistic Corps died earlier today in an explosion in Helmand Province," he said. "He will be missed by us, his comrades, but he will not be forgotten."
