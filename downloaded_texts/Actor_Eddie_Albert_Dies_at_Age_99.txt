Eddie Albert, well-known for his role as back-to-nature attorney Oliver Douglas in the surrealistic '60's TV series "Green Acres," has died at the age of 99. 

Albert, who suffered from Alzheimer's disease in later years, succumbed to pneumonia on Thursday at his California home. His son Edward Albert was by his side at the time.

Although he gained his greatest fame in "Green Acres," Albert had a long movie, TV, and stage career stretching back to the 1930s. His first role came in 1938, playing opposite Ronald Reagan in the comedy "Brother Rat." He went on to co-star in such movies as "Roman Holiday" (1953), The Longest Day" (1962), and "The Longest Yard" (1974).

Mr. Albert was also a vigorous environmental and social activist, making many trips on behalf of UNICEF and helping found the Plaza de la Raza foundation in Los Angeles to assist poor Hispanic youth. He played a significant role in urging the US to ban DDT, which it did in 1972, and was instrumental in starting Earth Day.

Eddie Albert's most recent movie role was in 1995's "The Barefoot Executive."
