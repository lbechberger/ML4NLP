On Monday, Brittania House in Bradford, UK was closed due to a security alert. A Wikinews reporter received notification that the Yorkshire Building Society Howard House Branch was closed until further notice. This turned out to be an evacuation of a small area due to a suspect package. It was a false alarm.

Britain has been in an increased state of vigilance since last Thursday's attack with fifty security alerts on the Tube according to Metro newspaper and the evacuation of Birmingham city centre on Saturday night.
