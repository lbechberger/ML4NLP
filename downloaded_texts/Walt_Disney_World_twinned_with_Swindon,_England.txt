Swindon, England, has an unusual new twin town: Walt Disney World in Florida. The Wiltshire town beat 24 others in a competition to become the first ever to be twinned with the famous resort.

Rebecca Warren, a local building society worker, created a poem and video praising Swindon which won over the judges. Among other features she highlighted the town's well-known Magic Roundabout, a complicated junction composed of five interlinked mini-roundabouts, comparing it to Disney World's teacup rides.

A sign marking the twinning is planned for the roundabout. Ms. Warren will travel to Florida with her eleven-year-old nephew and five-year-old niece to unveil a similar sign at the resort. A celebration will be held in Swindon in January, and it will also be the focus of an exhibit at Walt Disney World's Epcot park.

"Britain clearly has a love for Walt Disney World and long-standing affinity with the parks and their magic, which is probably why the number and quality of entries received was so high," said Disney's Hugh Wood. Other towns shortlisted in the competition included Aberdeen, Blackpool, Milton Keynes, and Cambridge.
