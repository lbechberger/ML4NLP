Dwayne Wade had 36 points to lead the Miami Heat to a 98-74 victory Thursday night over the Dallas Mavericks. Miami's win over Dallas evens the NBA Finals series to 2-2.

Wade hit 13 of his 23 shots. Miami's Shaquille O'Neal added 17 points and 13 rebounds.

Dallas scored only seven points in the fourth quarter for a record-low in any quarter in the NBA Finals history.

Miami coach Pat Riley said "It was our best game, there's no doubt, of this series. Our defense was very active tonight. We did not want to give them free throws and did not want to give them layups and jumpers."

The fifth game of the series will be played in Miami this Sunday, June 18. The sixth and, if necessary, the seventh games will be played in Dallas.
