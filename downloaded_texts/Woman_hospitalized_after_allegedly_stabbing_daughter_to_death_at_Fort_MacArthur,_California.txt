On Friday, the Los Angeles Police Department arrested and charged a woman with murder, after she reportedly stabbed her ten-year-old daughter to death at the Air Force base Fort MacArthur residential facility in San Pedro, California. The girl's father is a former member of the Navy.

The 49-year-old mother, Bong Sook Chavez, allegedly slit her daughter's wrists and neck. Chavez slit her own wrists after attacking her daughter. In a statement issued on Monday, investigators say Chavez likely stabbed her daughter while she was asleep in bed.

Deputy Chief Pat Gannon told the Los Angeles Times Chavez has a history of mental health problems. According to Gannon, "The father was able to get the weapon away from her." The father awoke at around 2:30 a.m. local time to find Chavez attacking her daughter. 

The daughter, Quesi Chavez, later died at the University of Southern California's Medical Center as a result of her wounds. As of Monday, the mother remained in the hospital in stable condition, but was scheduled to appear in court yesterday.
