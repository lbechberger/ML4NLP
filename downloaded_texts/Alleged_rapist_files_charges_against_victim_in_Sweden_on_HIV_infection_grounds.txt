Helsingborgs Dagblad, a Swedish newspaper, reported Monday that a man who has been arrested for sexual assault, has now pressed charges against the woman, whom he allegedly attacked, for not disclosing that she had HIV.

The incident happened in Helsingborg where the woman and the man took a taxi together. The man supposedly lured the woman up to his apartment stating that he was going to give her money for the taxi fare, and it is there that the incident is alleged to have happened.

The woman claims that he then forced her to have intercourse and participate in other sexual activities. She has explained that she begged him to use a condom, but to no avail. It was only when she told him that she had children waiting at home, that he let her go.

The man, on the other hand, told the police that he had paid her 3,512 Swedish krona (US$483) as he believed her to be a prostitute and that he was both sexually excited and drunk. He told the police that the reason she pressed charges against him was that she wanted to save herself.

It is not confirmed whether the man has been infected.

Sexual assault in Sweden is punishable by a minimum of two years in prison.
