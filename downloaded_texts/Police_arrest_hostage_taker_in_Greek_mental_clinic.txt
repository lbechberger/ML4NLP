A hostage situation in the private mental clinic Castalia, in the suburb of Glyfada, south Athens, has ended with the arrest of a 26 year old man. The man had locked himself up along with three hostages in the Accounts Department, on the first floor of the building. 

According to Greek police the man, who was armed, has mental problems and is a drug addict. His demands were unknown to the police, as he did not communicate them to the police negotiators. The situation in the Castalia clinic prompted the Greek Minister of Public Order to cancel his scheduled meetings in order to supervise personally the rescue operation.
