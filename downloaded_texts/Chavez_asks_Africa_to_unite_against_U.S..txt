Hugo Chávez called on Africa Saturday to develop closer ties with Latin America to fight what he called the threat of U.S.A. hegemony.

"In Venezuela, we were tired of all our oil going to Count Dracula," Chávez said to applause in the Gambian capital of Banjul. "Now Venezuela is free and we have recovered control over our oil. We should march together, Africa and Latin America, brother continents with the same roots ... Only together can we change the direction of the world," he told the opening day of the African Union summit. In Africa "we know there are international companies that do not pay taxes on what they get from petrol, or some pay very little." Chávez said.

"The world is threatened by the hegemony of the North American empire," said Chávez, following speeches that had criticized colonialism; speeches made by African leaders.

Hugo Chávez is attending the African Union summit and has long been opposed to U.S Foreign policy. He has also praised the leader of Iran in his policies against the U.S and raised taxes significantly on oil companies in Venezuela.
