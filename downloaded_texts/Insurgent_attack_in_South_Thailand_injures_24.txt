The city of Yala, Thailand was hit by a bomb attack this morning in a fresh food market wounding 24, including three soldiers. One injured soldier is said to be in a serious condition.

The bomb was hidden in a motorcycle and detonated via remote. The police believe the bomb contained between seven and ten kilograms of explosives. Two men were witnessed parking the bike; police had checked the vehicle without detecting the bomb. It is suspected the bomb may have been detonated using a mobile phone.

This particular area of the city has been a target of local insurgents in the past; four attacks have occurred nearby and the implementation of new security measures is under consideration. These may include a prohibition on parking vehicles in front of the market, and introduction of closed-circuit television in the area.

The explosion occurred around 7:30 am local time (00.30 UTC). A range of civilians were injured in addition to members of the military; the attack is being blamed on insurgent members of the Malay-Muslim majority in southern Thailand.
