A woman appeared today in the magistrates' court in Croydon, London accused of a racially aggravated public order charge after a video was watched by over 11 million people on YouTube allegedly showing her shouting racial abuse at passengers on a tram.

Emma West, 34, a resident of New Addington, cried and bowed her head while the footage was played in court. To protect West's safety, an application of bail was denied. She has been remanded in custody until January 3.

West's case will be transferred to the Crown Court to be heard by a judge and jury. Her plea status is unclear; earlier reports of her saying "not guilty" are, according to the BBC, a court error with her not actually having pled.
