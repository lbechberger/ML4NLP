Despite lots of publicity and media attention causing a last minute rush to buy tickets, there was no winner of the £85m jackpot in this week's 'Euromillions' lottery. This is the tenth week that no-one has won the top prize, which has 'rolled-over' to create bigger and bigger jackpots each week. Next week's jackpot now looks set to be worth around £100m, the biggest in European lottery history.

To win the jackpot, Players must match five main numbers from 1 to 50, plus two 'Lucky Star' numbers from one to nine. This week's winning numbers were 12, 15, 33, 44 and 50, with the Lucky Stars being 2 and 6.

The pan-Europe lotter is open to players in Austria, Belgium, France, Ireland, Luxembourg, Portugal, Spain, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.

The odds of winning the jackpot are 1 in 76,275,360. 

If the estimated £100 million jackpot were to be shared equally amongst the populations of the countries participating, each person would receive 50p.
