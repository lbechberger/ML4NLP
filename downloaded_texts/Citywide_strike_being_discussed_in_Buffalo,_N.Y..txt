The Buffalo News is reporting that leaders of unions representing city employees in Buffalo, New York, met on Wednesday to discuss a possible 'citywide strike.' If the unions decided on a strike, firefighters, police officers, teachers and many other city employees would not show up for work.

The News is reporting that employees are upset about the wage-freeze which was put into effect when the Control Board took control of the city's finances 27 months ago. Some employees even call the wage freeze "working class genocide."

"Genocide of the working class is also illegal," president of the Police Benevolent Association, Robert P. Meegan Jr., said to reporters when told that a strike would be illegal, after the meeting.

"We don't expect to see any job actions with the bargaining units directly under the city administration. The fact that their legal counsel wouldn't let [unions] comment any further speaks for itself," said mayor of Buffalo, Byron W. Brown in reference to New York state's Taylor Law which makes striking illegal.

Members of the Control Board have refused to comment to the press about the option to strike.

A lawsuit has been filed by the Police Benevolent Association's union which would allow workers to strike if a judge grants permission to do so.
