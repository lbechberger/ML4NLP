Adidas, the second largest sports clothes manufacturer in the world, has announced it has struck a deal with the American company Reebok for EUR 3.1 billion. The deal has to be agreed by the Reebok shareholders.

Adidas is doing this to increase its share in the US market and to compete with Nike, the largest sports brand in the world. Even after the merger, Nike will still be larger than the combined companies.

Reebok's shares have risen by 16% to $51. Adidas is offering $59 a share.
