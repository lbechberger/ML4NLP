Rock group U2 will play a third date at Dublin's Croke Park this year. Following strong demand from fans, the group have announced that they will play Monday June 27th in addition to the 23rd and 24th.

The band's current Vertigo tour has proved extremely popular among fans, with the original 160,000 Dublin tickets sold in less than an hour. The tour officially kicked off in San Diego, USA on 28 March 2005.

Although no support act has yet been lined up for the extra date, it is widely believed that promoters MCD will have no trouble selling the additional 80,000 tickets.
