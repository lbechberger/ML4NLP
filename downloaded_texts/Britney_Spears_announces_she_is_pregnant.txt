Following weeks of speculation in some media quarters, it has been announced that Britney Spears, 23, is pregnant. 
In a posting on her Web site, Spears announced that she and husband, Kevin Federline, 27, were expecting their first child together. Her publicist, Sonia Muckle, confirmed the singer's pregnancy Tuesday but gave no further information.

"The time has finally come to share our wonderful news that we are expecting our first child together. There are reports that I was in the hospital this weekend," read a statement allegedly written by Spears. 

Federline has two children with his ex-girlfriend, actress Shar Jackson. He met Spears last year when he was a backup dancer on her tour and his girlfriend was pregnant with their son.
