Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie are to let Getty Images sell photos of their new baby Shiloh Nouvel Jolie-Pitt - and have asked the proceeds go to charity.



"While we celebrate the joy of the birth of our daughter, we recognize that 2 million babies born every year in the developing world die on the first day of their lives. These children can be saved, but only if governments around the world make it a priority," the couple said, in a joint statement.

It is thought the rights to the photographs will be bought for upwards $5 million and that the money will go to a charity for African children. 

Getty images will arrange a private photo shoot for the baby. "We are honored that the Jolie-Pitt family has recognized our long-term commitment to these critical issues, as well as our ability to use the power of imagery to make a difference in the lives of many," said Jonathan Klein, Getty's CEO and cofounder.

Born in a hospital in Namibia on May 27 paparazzi were immediately interested in a snapshot of the Hollywood stars' child who weighed in at 7lbs. 

The baby's mother Angelina Jolie, 30, an Oscar winning actress, is a goodwill ambassador for U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees. She has two adopted children Maddox, 4, and Zahara, aged 15 months.
