Partial local elections will be held in 26 small towns in Romania, on June 12, to elect new local council and mayors. The elections will be organised in all localities where mayors recently ended their terms, as well as in localities that were recently proclaimed to town status.

Elections for new council and mayors will take place in several towns in the counties of Bacău, Vrancea, Galaţi, Braşov and Ilfov, while local elections for choosing new mayors only will be held in towns in the counties of Maramureş, Bihor, Vaslui, Buzău and Dâmboviţa

Romania's last full local elections were held in June 2004. However, partial elections are frequently held in between scheduled elections for those towns where mayors have resigned or ended their terms.
