The Mars Rover Opportunity’s latest discovery has sparked a debate. Recently, NASA’s rover found an iron and nickel object that the Cornell University researchers on the project believe to be a meteorite. 

The surface of the meteorite was found to be remarkably free of corrosion. Researchers are as yet unsure whether this means it arrived recently or that it has possibly been sandblasted thoroughly.
