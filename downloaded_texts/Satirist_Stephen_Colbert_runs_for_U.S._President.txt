The American satirist Stephen Colbert has announced that he will run for the Presidency of the United States. He made his announcement on his mock news show The Colbert Report.

However, Colbert said that he would only run in his home state of South Carolina as a favorite son. He also said that he would represent both major political parties: the Republicans and the Democrats. It is not known how far Colbert will go with his character during his electoral run.

Colbert has hosted The Colbert Report, a spin-off to another satirical television series, The Daily Show, since its creation in 2005. "I didn't have a job back then. I wonder what it was like to have a job back then. I am sure I could ask a dentist or a surgeon. He would know." On the show he plays a right-wing political pundit, based on real-life pundits such as Bill O'Reilly and Stone Phillips. Colbert has been credited with popularizing certain words such as "Truthiness", meaning to believe something intuitively, without regard for actual facts, logic or evidence.

Filling in for New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd on Sunday, Colbert wrote: "I am not ready to announce yet â€” even though it's clear that the voters are desperate for a white, male, middle-aged, Jesus-trumpeting alternative."
