According to the United Nations, the Ethiopian gross domestic product (GDP) for 2009 increased by 1.7%. UN Deputy Secretary-General Asha-Rose Migiro said that the country might not be able to meet its 2015 anti-poverty goals due to the worldwide economic slowdown.

"Despite some notable achievements, progress is off track across the continent," Migiro said in the capital of Addis Ababa. She said Ethiopia's economy increased by about five percent between 2000 and 2008, but slowed down due to the ongoing global recession.

"Progress towards the Millennium Development Goals is likely to be adversely affected. The food and energy crises, as well as climate change, will also complicate our work," Migiro said.

The Ethiopian government, however, contradicted the UN report, saying that the country's economic growth was over ten percent for 2009.
