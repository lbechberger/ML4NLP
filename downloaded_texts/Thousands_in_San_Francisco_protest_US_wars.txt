Thousands of protesters gathered at San Francisco's Civic Center to protest US wars and foreign policy in Iraq, the Philippines, Cuba and other places. Domestic issues were also included in the speeches and signs. The protesters then marched through downtown San Francisco on a pre-planned route. They passed Glide Memorial Methodist Church to protest President Bush's cutting of programs like Glide's that provide food for needy people. The march also passed by the Hilton Hotel, where protesters were calling for a boycott in response to the hotel workers union's difficulty in obtaining a new contract.

Pro-Israel counter-protesters gathered across the street from the war protesters, although their number was much smaller.

California Green Party candidate Todd Chretien suggested that there were ten to twenty thousand war protesters present.
