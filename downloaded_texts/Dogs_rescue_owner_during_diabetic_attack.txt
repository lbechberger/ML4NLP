In Centerton, Indiana a man is alive thanks to his 2 dogs.

Bill Burns was taking his nightly stroll with his dogs, Butch and Dusty, when he had a severe diabetic attack in a cornfield.

His dogs immediately reacted.

Morgan County sheriff's Deputy, Steve Hoffman, was on a rural road just finishing with a traffic stop, when he noticed a light shining from a cornfield. "I noticed what appeared to be an illumination or a light that was flickering and facing my direction," Hoffman said. When he got out of his car and walked to where he saw the light, he found Butch was holding a flashlight like he would a bone, in his mouth. Meanwhile, Dusty had stretched himself across Mr. Burns to try and keep him warm.

Hoffman said he then noticed that Mr. Burns was wearing a diabetic medical bracelet and immediately took him to the hospital.

Burns says that he does not remember the ordeal, but thinks that Hoffman even seeing the light is remarkable enough for him.

"It's got to be just fate or faith, one or the other," Burns said.

The dogs "definitely are the heroes in the story," said Hoffman.

Burns was in the hospital nearly 4 days before he had been released.

"Had he not had the dogs with him that evening, I think the outcome would have been a lot worse," Hoffman said.
