The Scottish national rugby union team has defeated the English equivalent 15-9 to win the Calcutta Cup.

The match was played in wet and windy conditions at Murrayfield and was refereed by Jonathan Kaplan. Chris Paterson kicked four penalties and Dan Parks kicked another to give Scotland their 15 points. All nine of England's points came from penalties kicked by Jonny Wilkinson.

Rory Lamont was taken to hospital during the first half on a stretcher having had a collision with Iain Balshaw that saw the Englishman's knee strike the Scotsman's head. He regained consciousness before going to hospital.

Scotland had been expected to lose after poor performances in their previous three Six Nations Championship games this year.
