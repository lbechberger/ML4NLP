Australia have defeated India by 84 runs in the second ODI match of Australia's current tour of India at Nehru Stadium, Kochi, India.

Australia lead the 7-match ODI series 1-0, after the first match was abandoned due to rain.

After the first over, Australia were already one wicket down after Adam Gilchrist was dismissed for a duck. And shortly into the third over, things were not looking good for Australia, after Brad Hodge was caught behind for only 3 runs, and the figures were 2 wickets for eight runs. But things started improving with Matthew Hayden and Michael Clarke sharing a 54 run partnership before Clarke was stumped for 27. Hayden then, along with Andrew Symonds, blasted a 94 run partnership before being bowled by Irfan Pathan, making a total of 75 runs. Symonds was caught and bowled by fast-bowler Shanthakumaran Sreesanth in the 46th over after making 87 runs, and a 108-run parnership with Brad Haddin. Three overs later James Hopes was the third and final victim of Sreesanth after being caught by Rahul Dravid. Haddin survived the innings with 87 not-out, along with Brett Lee who achieved 2 runs.

India lost its first wicket shortly into the third over with Mitch Johnson bowling Gautam Gambhir for 7 runs. India didn't lose another wicket until Symonds caught a Stuart Clark bowled ball off Sachin Tendulkar. Clark then claimed a LBW on Robin Uthappa for 41 runs. Dravid (31) then fell in the 25th over, and one over later - Pathan (1) who was run out by Clarke. Harbhajan Singh was then stumped for 4, while Ramesh Powar (17) was bowled by Clark. Zaheer Khan (3) was then caught, and India was all out when captain Mahendra Dhoni was also caught during the 47th over after making the highest score of the innings - 58. Sreesanth remained with not out for 7 runs.
