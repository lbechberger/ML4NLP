CBS Radio, a subsidiary of CBS, fired Don Imus Thursday amidst controversy over comments made on the air last week about the Rutgers University women's basketball team.

Last week Imus called the team "nappy-headed hos" during one of his radio show broadcasts.

The CBS decision came one day after NBC News pulled the plug on the Imus Show's simulcast on MSNBC as a result of the remarks. A handful of advertisers withdrew their support of the Imus Show prior to both network's decisions. 

"There has been much discussion of the effect language like this has on our young people, particularly young women of color trying to make their way in this society. That consideration has weighed most heavily on our minds as we made our decision," said Leslie Moonves, the executive producer for CBS.

Imus does not hold the firing against CBS saying "I understand the pressure they were under. I said it. I wouldn't be here if I didn't say it."
