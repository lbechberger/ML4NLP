Police in South Africa clashed with thousands of demonstrators in two communities east of the city of Johannesburg on Tuesday.


The demonstrators, who were protesting poor housing conditions and lack of public services, had blockaded roads and set a municipal office in the town of Belfast on fire.

Riot police responded by firing rubber bullets and tear gas at the protesters to restore order, and arrested several residents.

Two police officers were injured after some of the residents started to throw stones at security officials.

Residents also clashed with security officials in several other towns in the area. Several people in Standerton, a town located southeast of Johannesburg, were hurt following a conflict with police officers.
