A helicopter and a small airplane collided near Frederick Municipal Airport in Frederick, Maryland just after 3:40 local time yesterday afternoon (1940 UTC). The collision was reported around a mile (one and a half kilometres) from the airport, just north of Interstate 70.

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said the Robinson R44 helicopter was on a training mission when it collided with a Cirrus SR-22. The helicopter had three people aboard while the Cirrus had two. Both people aboard the Cirrus were injured and all three aboard the helicopter were killed in the collision.

The two injured people from the plane were checked out at a hospital and have since been released.

The plane was still mostly in one piece while a witness reported the helicopter was unrecognizable. 

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) heads the investigation.
