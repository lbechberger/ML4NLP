Local police reports say that 47 people were injured and 60 arrested in Hamburg, Germany, following violence between police and protestors over the past two days.

2,000 officers were deployed to help contain the riots. They deployed water cannons against the demonstrators, whose numbers were reported by different sources as 2,000 and 6,000. The demonstrators, protesting a rally held by about 100 members of the far-right National Democratic Party, had been throwing stones and other objects in the neighbourhood of Schanzenviertel. Several cars were set on fire and the demonstrators destroyed a bus stop.

Senior police official Peter Born said 28 police officers were wounded in the clashes.
