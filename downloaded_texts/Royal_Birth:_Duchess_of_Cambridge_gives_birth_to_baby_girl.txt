The UK's Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge gave birth yesterday to a baby girl, and Kensington Palace announced, "Her Royal Highness the Duchess of Cambridge was safely delivered of a daughter at 8:34 am."

The announcement also said Catherine and the baby are "doing well." The daughter of the royal couple was said to weigh 8lbs 3oz. 

Earlier in the day Catherine was admitted in labour into the Lindo Wing of St Mary's Hospital in London. 

Kensington Palace released a statement that the Duchess went to the hospital by car and was admitted into Saint Mary's at 6am local time.

The baby is the fourth in line to the throne. Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott stated, "On behalf of all Australians, Margie and I extend to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge congratulations on the birth of a daughter [...] we wish the young Princess a long and happy life." UK Prime Minister David Cameron sent well wishes earlier via Twitter, saying, "The whole country will wish her well." 

Prince George's birth also took place in Saint Mary's in 2013, and Prince William's in 1982. Obstetrician Guy Thorpe-Beeston, along with Alan Farthing, surgeon gynaecologist to Queen Elizabeth II, were present for the second royal birth. The announcement of the birth also said, "The Queen, The Duke of Edinburgh, The Prince of Wales, The Duchess of Cornwall, Prince Harry, and members of both families have been informed and are delighted with the news."
