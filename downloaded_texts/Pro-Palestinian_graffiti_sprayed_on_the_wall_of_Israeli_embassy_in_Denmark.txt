This Friday, 29th of April at 4pm, pro-Palestinian graffiti was sprayed on the outside wall of Israeli Embassy in Denmark claiming "Break down the Wall" (Danish: "Riv muren ned").
Surveillance videos reveal a group of four women responsible for the act, as well as a driver. The women were not wearing any form of uniform, or appeared to have common ethnic background and were of different age groups. The operation was completed in less than a minute and the four offenders fled the scene.

"They must have planned the operation ahead," says Sholi Ron, the embassy's chief security officer, "as suggested by the relative speed of the operation. Yet, they did not take into account the surveillance cameras, which gives the police an edge." He also pointed out that the colors were not chosen by accident.

A driver nearby has written down the plate number for the suspected vehicle. Police claim the vehicle was identified as a Mitsubishi van.

"Black, red and green, do those colors say anything to you?" says a passerby. "These are the same colors of the Palestinian flag, as well as the base for other Arab nation's flags, I think that whoever did this thing is on the Palestinian side."
