A vote of no-confidence, to be held on Monday, is expected to signal an end to the current Canadian government. The vote is to be held at 6:30PM local time in Ottawa, Ontario.

The no-confidence vote against Paul Martin's government was introduced by three of the opposition parties last week. The actual motion was proposed by Conservative party leader, Stephen Harper.
