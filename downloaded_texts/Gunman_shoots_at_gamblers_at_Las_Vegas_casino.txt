A 51-year-old man fired 16 rounds from a semiautomatic handgun from a balcony overlooking the floor of the New York New York Hotel &amp; Casino in Las Vegas, Nevada. The shooting left four people with non-life threatening injuries. They were treated and released from a local hospital later that morning.
 
Steven Zegrean was tackled by two off-duty military reservists who held him down until Las Vegas police reached the scene. The incident occurred at 12:15 a.m. PST (UTC-7).

Mr. Zegrean was quickly arrested on felony charges including attempted murder, battery with a deadly weapon and discharging a firearm in an occupied structure. It is believed that he was emotionally distraught.
