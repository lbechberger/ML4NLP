Turkey will be adopting new passports standardized according to the International Civil Aviation Organization guidelines. The passports, which are expected to be distributed at the beginning of next year, will have RFID chips embedded in them. These chips, loaded with the passport owner's private information, will be used in airport gates. To obtain a new passport, one will need only a national identity card.

RFID chips, sometimes called "spychips", are controversial, especially when loaded with personal information. For instance, one can scan the chip and obtain the private information in it from a distance without the information or consent of the individual carrying the chip. Currently, there seems to be no discussion about the controversies surrounding RFID chips in the Turkish media.
