Ismael Abdurahman was arrested in connection with the July 21 bombings in London and has been charged with terrorism offences. He is the first person to be charged in connection with the attacks.

The charge reads: "Between July 23 and July 28 he had information he knew or believed might be of material assistance in securing the apprehension, prosecution or conviction of another person in the UK for an offence involving the commission, preparation or instigation of an act of terrorism."

He will appear before Bow Street Magistrates in London on August 4. 

Hussain Osman, another suspect for the July 21 incident at Shepherds Bush who the UK authorities wish to extradite from Italy, claims that the device in his rucksack was merely bag of flour with a detonator in it. He escaped from Britain via the Channel Tunnel and was arrested last week in Rome. He told his Italian lawyer that he was only staging a demonstration and had no intention of killing anyone.
