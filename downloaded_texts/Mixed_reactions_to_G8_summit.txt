On Friday, the annual meeting of the leaders of the world's eight most powerful countries, the Group of Eight (G8), ended ahead of schedule with few resolutions to the disappointment of many. The G8 meeting ended early Friday to accommodate Tony Blair, who requested to return to London in response to Thursday's bombings in London. At the conclusion of the meeting, the leaders pledged to increase humanitarian aid to Africa by $50 billion, however $30 billion had already been pledged previously.

The group was unable to make significant progress regarding global warming, but made several key decisions relating to combating poverty in Africa. The eight leaders pledged to double the previously proposed aid of $25 billion to $50 billion a year by 2010. The group also confirmed an earlier announcement that they would cancel the debt of 18 countries, mostly in Africa, selected from among the 38 heavily indebted poor countries (HIPCs).

Additionally, $2 billion was earmarked for aid to the Palestine Nation. In addition to the increase in aid for Africa, the group announced universal access to AIDS treatment, committed to a peacekeeping force in Africa, and heard African leaders' promises to move toward democracies that follow the rule of law.
