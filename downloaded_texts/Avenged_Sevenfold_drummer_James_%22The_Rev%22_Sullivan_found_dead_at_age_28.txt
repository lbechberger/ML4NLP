The drummer of metalcore rock band Avenged Sevenfold, James Owen Sullivan, has been found dead at his California home located in the United States. Sullivan, better known as "The Rev," was found dead on Monday at his home in Huntington Beach at around 1:00 p.m. (PST). It is believed that the 28-year-old died of natural causes. 

Sullivan was one of the founding members of Avenged Sevenfold when the group debuted in 1999. The group achieved notable success when they won the MTV Best New Artist award in 2006. The group was reportedly working on a fifth album at the time of Sullivan’s death. 

Avenged Sevenfold released a statement via their website saying "It is with great sadness and heavy hearts that we tell you of the passing today of Jimmy “The Rev” Sullivan. Jimmy was not only one of the world's best drummers, but more importantly he was our best friend and brother. Our thoughts and prayers go out to Jimmy's family and we hope that you will respect their privacy during this difficult time." 

They added, "Jimmy you are forever in our hearts. We love you."

An investigation into the cause of Sullivan's death is ongoing.
