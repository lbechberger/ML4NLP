Heavy rain has washed away a 20-metre stretch of National Highway 75, in Alba county, western Romania, leaving only one of the lanes open to traffic. Both the road and the side fences fell into the Arieş River due to the rain. Repair teams from the National Roads Department were called in to assess the damage and clear away the trees that had fallen onto the highway.

Western Romania has recently faced a week of heavy rain, which has caused heavy flooding in some areas, and in other areas has damaged infrastructure. Parts of Timiş county remain heavily flooded, along with the northern Serbian region of Vojvodina. Some people have deemed the floods in this region to be the worst in 50 years.
