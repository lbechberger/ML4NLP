The New York Giants defeated the New England Patriots 17-14 to win Super Bowl XLII at University of Phoenix Stadium in Glendale, Arizona, Sunday night. A touchdown by the New York Giants in the last seconds of the very tight game disrupted the New England Patriots' quest for a perfect, undefeated season.

The Patriots attained the lead early in the second quarter, and regained it with 2:42 left in the 4th quarter, losing it only when the game-winning touchdown was scored by Plaxico Burress with 35 seconds left to play.

"The drive at the end there were so many clutch plays by so many guys. It is an unbelievable game and an unbelievable feeling," said Giants quarterback Eli Manning.

The first quarter started off with a 16 play drive by the Giants which took up nearly 10 minutes and ended in a field goal. Three seconds into the second quarter, the Patriots answered back with a 1 yard run from Laurence Maroney after a pass interference call.

The third quarter of the game was scoreless. With 11:05 remaining in the fourth quarter, Eli Manning threw a five yard pass to David Tyree, making the score 10-7. The Patriots then made the score 14-10 on a seven yard pass from Tom Brady to Randy Moss.

The next drive for the Giants proved to be the winning one, with Tyree catching a pass that led the team to the Patriots' 24 yard line; Plaxico Burress' following touchdown reception was enough to regain the lead and win the game. 

Eli Manning was named the Super Bowl Most Valuable Player and was awarded the Pete Rozell Trophy.

"This is the greatest feeling in professional sports. For us to come out and win a world championship tonight -- nobody gave us a shot," said Plaxico Burress.
