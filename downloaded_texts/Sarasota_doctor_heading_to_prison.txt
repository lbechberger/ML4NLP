Former Sarasota dermatologist Michael Rosin is heading to prison to serve a 22-year prison sentence for defrauding Medicare by performing unnecessary surgeries on elderly Sarasota, Florida patients.

On Rosin's 56th birthday, in front of his family, Judge William Castagna sentinced him to 22 years in federal prison. The judge also ordered Rosin to pay $3.7 Million to the government, $3.6 Million to the medicare trust fund and $48,866 to patients.

More than 865 elderly Sarasota area residents had multiple surgeries performed by Rosin when biopsies showed of no signs of cancer, or could not be read. Rosin was convicted of diagnosing cancer on almost everyone who entered his office. Biopsy slides were found to have bubble gum or foam on it instead of skin samples.

Former patients of Rosin testified at the trial that his surgeries left them disfigured. The $46,866 awarded to the patients will help to repay them for the costs associated with the unnecessary surgeries.

Throughout the trial Rosin maintained that he was innocent. He blamed his office staff for the unreadible slides and the slides with the gum and foam on them. Rosin said his biggest mistake was giving his office staff too much access to the lab.

Rosin's attorney said that the doctor will appeal his convection. Rosin tried many different defenses including that he was not competent to assist in his own defense.
