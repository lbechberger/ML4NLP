On Saturday 10, 2005, the world record for the largest performance of the Siege of Ennis, an Irish folk dance, was set in Cork, Ireland. It was organised by the Triskel Arts Centre and the local newspaper Evening Echo, and was part of the city's tenure as European Capital of Culture.

It beat the previous record set in Dublin, Ohio. This attempt was sponsored by Michael Flatley.

The record breaking attempt was immediately followed by an actual dance.
