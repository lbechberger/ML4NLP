Times Square was shut down today due to a suspicious vehicle parked on 42nd Street and Broadway in New York. Police cordoned the area surrounding the white 1992 Dodge van to investigate the auto. The van has temporary license plates and tinted windows with tarps covering them.

The nearby NASDAQ building was evacuated, and reports from CBS said the Conde Nast building had been partially evacuated.

The investigation disrupted preparations for the New Year's eve ball drop atop One Times Square, although it still appears that the celebration will continue unaffected.

The investigation comes a day after police commissioner Raymond Kelly was interviewed by local TV outlet, WNBC, about how the city is after recent terrorist activity. "Reality is that New York is the number one target in this country [...] But it has been doing more than any other city in America and probably the world," he said on the topic that New York had adequate counter-terrorism procedure. Wikinews contacted the New York City Police Department, but they had no comment about the specific issue at this time.
