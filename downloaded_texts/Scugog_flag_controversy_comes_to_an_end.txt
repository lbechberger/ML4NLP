The Scugog flag controversy has now came to an end. The controversy began when councillor Lynn Philip Hodgson lowered the town hall flag out of respect for a fallen Canadian soldier.

Rather than an issue of patriotism, the controversy dealt with union contracts which may have specified that the raising and lowering of flags was a role reserved only for union members.

Liz Drebit, CUPE Local 1785-01 unit chairman, said she is "extremely upset by the spin that portrayed the grievance as a lack of respect for fallen Canadian soldiers". "My apologies to the Legion. Never ever did we have any intent to cause them any distress, and pain, any suffering because of this," she said.

"I thought I was doing the right thing at the time and I still think I did," Hodgson said yesterday.

"The public reaction to the lowering of the flag in a timely manner needs to be addressed," said Drebit.

The union dropped the grievance and said it was all a "misunderstanding."
