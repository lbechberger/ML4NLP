Reading and Manchester United clashed today in a fifth round FA cup replay at the Madjeski Stadium. Neither team fielded a full strength side, with Leroy Lita and Steven Hunt on the bench for Reading, and Cristiano Ronaldo and Wayne Rooney as substitutes for United.

United started the game with a blitz, scoring 3 goals in the first 6 minutes. Gabriel Heinze started the scoring by shooting in a John O'Shea cross. 2 minutes later, Louis Saha received a long ball from Rio Ferdinand and sent the ball into the back of the net, doubling the lead. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer then scored the 3rd, as he beat the offside trap and curled the ball into the net. Reading did not give up the fight, and scored on 23 minutes, when Dave Kitson headed home an Ingimarson cross. The game stayed at the 3-1 scoreline for much of the rest of the game, until 84 minutes, when Leroy Lita scored to force an edgy finish. Litas powerful header off a Glen Little cross left keeper Edwin Van Der Sar helpless, leaving Reading in sight of extra time. A shot by Brynjar Gunnarsson which rattled of the crossbar could have caused an amazing comeback, but Manchester United were able to hold on, and advance to the sixth round of the FA cup.

Manchester will face Middlesbrough in the next round, who defeated West Bromwich Albion today after a penalty shootout.
