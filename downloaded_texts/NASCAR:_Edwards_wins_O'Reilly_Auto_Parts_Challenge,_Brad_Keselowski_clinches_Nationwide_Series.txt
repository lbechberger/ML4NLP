Roush Fenway Racing driver Carl Edwards won the NASCAR Nationwide Series 2010 O'Reilly Auto Parts Challenge held yesterday at Texas Motor Speedway in Fort Worth, Texas.





Kyle Busch came in second for Joe Gibbs Racing, and Brad Keselowski finished third to win his title after leading through the season. Busch's teammate Joey Logano started from 10th place on the starting grid, but finished 4th in front of Martin Truex, Jr. Jason Leffler (Braun Racing) and Reed Sorenson (Braun Racing) finished behind Truex, Jr. in 6th and 7th. Kevin Harvick, Paul Menard, and Steve Wallace rounded out the top ten finishers in the race. Pole position winner James Buescher finished 37th, after being involved in an accident on lap 44.

In the Drivers' championship, Keselowski clinched the championship with 5,314 points, 465 ahead of Edwards, and 695 ahead of Busch in third. Justin Allgaier was scored fourth, Menard was sixth, and Harvick was seventh, after finishing eighth. Trevor Bayne and Leffler was ninth and tenth. Keselowski now cannot be beaten with only two races to go. "My whole family made so many sacrifices along the way and I'm surrounded by great people. I'm happy and blessed to have this whole team around me. Almost had a win here today and wanted it to work out," he said after the race.

Afterward, Edwards commented, "I had to do everything I could. I got the best restart I could and it ended up giving us the race. I knew if I gave him an inch he would beat us." Busch followed in the press conference and said "Carl Edwards jumped the restart by about three lengths before the restart mark." He was then asked if he should have brought it up to NASCAR, but he answered, "Does it fucking matter? Race is over. Carl Edwards is in victory lane. Nothing you can do about it. Our car was fast in the beginning but didn't have the speed it took at the end of the race. I don't know if it was under the hood or through the corners. It was disappointing finishing second but whatever."
