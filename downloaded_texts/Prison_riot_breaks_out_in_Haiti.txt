A riot took place at the main prison in Haiti on Sunday. The prison is located within a few miles of the Parliament building.

According to the Associated Press, at least 100 prisoners stormed the roof of the prison and were seen holding what appeared to be 2 dead inmates. Prisoners were also heard chanting "freedom or death" and held a banner saying "Justice."

Haitian police and United Nations Peacekeepers arrived on scene shortly after the riot erupted and surrounded the prison.

The riot occurred just hours before the inauguration of Haitian President René Préval. Préval, who previously served as Prime Minister in 1991 and as President from 1996 to 2001, had no official statement about the riot, which occurred just a half-mile from the parliament building from which Préval was inaugurated Sunday.
