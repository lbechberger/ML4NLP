A $2,500 reward has been issued by the Humane Society of the United States for information on an "implied terroristic threat", according to Sergeant Jim Gray of the St. Paul Police Department.

According to Crystal Brown, 17 year old owner of the dog, a gift-wrapped box with a note saying "Congratulations Crystal. This side up. Batteries included.", was left on her doorstep along with the severed head of her dog, Chevy, and a Valentine's Day candy.

The dog, an Australian shepherd mix called Chevy, went missing in February and Crystal, his owner, spent weeks searching for him, posting fliers, going door to door, and visiting the local animal shelter.

Dale Bartlett, Deputy Manager for the Humane Society said that "This case was extremely heinous. I deal with hundreds and hundreds of cruelty cases each year. When I read about this case, it just took my breath away."

"This was so cruel," Crystal said. "We're dealing with one sick, twisted person."
