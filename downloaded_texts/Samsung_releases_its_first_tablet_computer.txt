At the Internationale Funkausstellung Berlin (IFA) industrial exhibition in Berlin, the South Korean corporation Samsung released its first tablet computer, called "Galaxy Tab".

The device features the Android operating system and a seven-inch screen. Samsung's own applications, called "Reader's Hub" and "Media Hub," display ebooks and videos respectively. Latest Flash, and an interface to stream to TV also are included. Wireless technologies supported include 3G networks, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth.

The device is a competitor to Apple's iPad. British newspaper The Daily Mail considered the appearance of the Galaxy Tab on the market as a serious event for Apple, because the device has a smaller screen, and Samsung was expecting to set a price 1.5 to 2 times lower than the iPad. Samsung were considering a ten inch screen on future models. Galaxy Tab is "the first of the company's tablet devices", as a spokesperson said.

Head of product portfolio Thomas Richter expressed optimism about the device's market future : "This is not just another tablet. We call it a Smart Media device."

Samsung's head of mobile communications J.K. Shin was also positive about the release of Galaxy Tab, commenting that "[t]here is a new and emerging consumer demand that Samsung can satisfy since mobile is in our DNA."
