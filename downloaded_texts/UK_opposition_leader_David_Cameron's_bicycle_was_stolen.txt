Conservative Party leader David Cameron was last night a victim of crime following the theft of his bicycle.

The Leader of the Opposition in the United Kingdom was out shopping in West London when the incident happened at around 6:30 last night. He was said to have chained the bike to a short bollard while he picked up some groceries in Tesco on Portobello Road. When he came out, the bike along with its chain had vanished.

He stated that he "would very much like it back" and that to him "it was absolutely priceless". He is also said to have reported the theft on the Scotland Yard online reporting website, but was pessimistic about it being returned. The thieves are said to be a group of teenagers.

Around 19,000 bicycles are reported stolen every year in London alone.

Cameron's spokesperson said he had owned the bike for five years, and used it regularly to cycle to work. She stated he was "pretty hacked off" by the theft.
