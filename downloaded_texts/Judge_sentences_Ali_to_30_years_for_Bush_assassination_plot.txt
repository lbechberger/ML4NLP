Ahmed Omar Abu Ali, a 25-year-old U.S. citizen, was sentenced by a U.S. district court judge to 30 years in prison on Tuesday for plotting to assassinate United States President George W. Bush. Ali, a self-proclaimed member of Al Qaeda, was arrested by Saudi officials in 2003 at the Islamic University of Medina.

Prosecutors had originally asked for a life sentence, but the judge said that the 30-year sentence was adequate, comparing the case to the "American Taliban" John Lindh. In addition, the judge pointed out that Ali's actions "did not result in one single actual victim. That fact must be taken into account."

Ali had given a statement to Saudi officials after his capture stating that he had joined Al Qaeda and talked with its senior members about plots to assassinate the President and to establish a terrorist cell in the United States. He asserted that his confession had been obtained through torture.
