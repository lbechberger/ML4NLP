"It is my sad duty to inform you that a short time ago Phillip Hughs passed away," said Australian national team doctor Peter Brukner in a statement.

As the news broke, condolences came from around Australia's sporting community.

"A sad, sad day. Absolutely devastating. Thoughts go out to Phillip Hughes' family and friends. #RIPPhillipHughes," Australian women's captain Meg Lanning tweeted.

"Our thoughts are with Philipâ€™s family and everyone affected by this tragic accident," said Football Federation Australia CEO David Gallop.

"The West Australian Football Commission [WAFC] on behalf of football in WA extends sincere sympathies to the family and friends of Phillip Hughes," tweeted the WAFC.

Today was meant to be the third day of the Sheffield Shield match Hughes was involved in. The entire round of matches was abandoned after the incident.
