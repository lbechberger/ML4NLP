The chief judge in Saddam Hussein's trial submitted his resignation yesterday. The reasons for his resignation are still unknown, and it is unknown at this time whether his resignation will be accepted.

Rizgar Mohammed Amin–one of a five tribunal judges overseeing Hussein's case–offered to resign, a court official told the press. Prosecutor Jaafar al-Mousawi, told the media that Amin's resignation, if accepted, would not affect the proceedings because he can be quickly and easily replaced.

Since the trial opened on Oct. 19, two defense lawyers have been assassinated, and a third fled the country. Police also uncovered a plot to fire rockets at the courtroom in late November 2005.

Another court official, who wished for his name not to be released, due to the sensitivity of the case, said Amin offered to resign, but efforts were under way to get him to reverse the decision.

At least two judges on the case earlier in the week said that the remarks that Amin was going to resign were "untrue."
