After a trawler sank in heavy seas on Saturday, in the Foveaux Strait, New Zealand, on the way back from muttonbirding. Of the nine people on board, including three generations of one family, only three survived. 

Police believe the boat sank in less than a minute. 

During the previous ten years, another six incidents occurred in the Strait, costing eight lives.

Maritime New Zealand investigators arrived in Bluff yesterday to begin an inquiry into the cause of the tragedy.
