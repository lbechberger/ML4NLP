The United Kingdom Home Secretary Charles Clarke has lost his position in a Cabinet reshuffle by Tony Blair, on the morning after the Labour Party suffered losses in local elections across England. The news follows two weeks of headlines caused by the release of over 1000 foreign prisoners mistakenly released from prison at the end of their sentence rather than being deported.

Current Defence Secretary John Reid will replace Clarke as the new Home Secretary, and Jack Straw will become Commons leader.
