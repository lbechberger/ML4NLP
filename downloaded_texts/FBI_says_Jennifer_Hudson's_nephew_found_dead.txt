The FBI has stated that they believe a dead body found in a white SUV in Chicago, Illinois, is that of 7-year-old Julian King. King was the nephew of American singer and Academy Award winning actress, Jennifer Hudson.

King was kidnapped from his home in Chicago on Friday after someone shot and killed Hudson's mother, Darnell Donerson, 57 and brother, Jason, 29. An AMBER Alert was issued shortly after the incident, and on Sunday, a US$100,000 reward was offered for his safe return.

"[We found a body] who we believe to be the missing victim in Chicago, the nephew of Jennifer Hudson. We are working with Chicago police to get a positive identification of the victim," said the FBI in a statement. An autopsy is scheduled to take place on Tuesday.

Police found the SUV, belonging to Jason, while searching for the boy on Monday. It had been parked in an area of brownstone houses and apartment buildings on the West-side of Chicago. It was found around 7:00 a.m. (CDT). Police searched the vehicle as it matched the description of the SUV sought in connection with the murder, kidnapping.

Police have detained and questioned several people, and some reports say that includes William Balfour, who police previous thought to have kidnapped King. Reports say he is Julia's ex-boyfriend, having since been separated. Police deny that he is a suspect in either the murders or kidnapping and will not confirm or deny if he is or was in custody. So far no charges have been filed against anyone for the crimes.
