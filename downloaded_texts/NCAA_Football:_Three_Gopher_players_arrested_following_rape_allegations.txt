Three players for the University of Minnesota Golden Gophers football team have been arrested following a rape allegation. The three players have been identified as defensive end Alex Daniels, cornerback Keith Massey, and running back E.J. Jones, all sophomores. They are in custody at the Hennepin County Jail pending charges. Bail has been set at $100,000 for each player.

The three are accused of raping an 18-year old woman at the University Village Apartments, where the accused players live. "Overnight one of the University Officers was flagged down by a young woman who wanted to make a report that she'd been sexually assaulted," said University Police Chief Greg Hestness. Hestness did not disclose further details of the allegations, though he stated the players "were booked on criminal sexual conduct in the third degree. And that usually does involve penetration, non-consensual penetration." Once an investigation is complete, the case will be presented to the Hennepin County attorney for possible charges.

Following Saturday's spring scrimmage at the Metrodome, new coach Tim Brewster said "Obviously it's a disappointing situation that's been presented to me. There's an investigation that's ongoing that we're going to cooperate fully with." The players have been suspended pending the outcome of the investigation, and did not participate in the annual intrasquad game.

Gophers athletic director Joel Maturi said "We will let the process take its course and then do the appropriate thing. But I'm not ready to abandon these kids. It's our responsibility to stand by them and their families."
