Bruce, Canberra â€” Earlier today at the Australian Institute of Sport, Australia's Minister for Sport Kate Lundy and the Leader of the Opposition Tony Abbott were on hand when the Australian Olympic Team formally announced the Australian artistic gymnastics team to compete at the 2012 Summer Olympics. Melbourne-based Georgia Bonora and Ashleigh Brennan, Perth residents Emily Little and Lauren Mitchell, and Brisbane resident Larrissa Miller booked their trip to London.

Lundy announced the government's A$4.5 million support for the Green and Gold Room in London. This facility, supported by the Australian Institute of Sport's experts, enables performance analysis to help the Australian Olympians excel during the London Games. Lundy also mentioned Gillard's Prime Ministers Challenge, which is not just for Australia's Olympians and Paralympians, but seeks to encourage the nation's young to play sports.

Abbott started off with a quip that the only gymnastics he participates in is verbal gymnastics. The opposition leader then told the media present that Australia's Olympians have the country's support, and congratulated the competitors on the hard work they have put in for over ten years to get there. 

In a conversation with a Wikinews reporter following the press conference, Miller said the team does not feel pressure from the media or other teams to do well. They are very team-oriented and when it is time to compete, they ignore everything else going on and focus on performing their best. The team does not need to worry about anything but competing because the gymnasts get support from Gymnastics Australia and the Australian Institute of Sport to cover the cost of everything they need.

With encouragement for the Olympians, Abbott and Lundy spent time on the trampoline. In a show of bipartisan support, Abbott assisted Lundy out of the foam pit they jumped into, with Lundy returning the favour.
