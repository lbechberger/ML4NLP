Roush Fenway Racing driver Greg Biffle, who qualified fifth, won the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series 2010 Price Chopper 400 held on October 3, 2010 at Kansas Speedway in Kansas City, Kansas, United States. This became his second win of the season.

Biffle was chased by Jimmie Johnson up to the finish line, but was not able to catch him this weekend. Following the race, Johnson became the points leader after three of ten events in the Chase for the Sprint Cup.

Kevin Harvick managed the third position in the closing laps of the race, after starting twenty-fourth on the grid. Pole position winner Kasey Kahne collided with the wall earlier in the race, which prompted him to a thirty-seventh place finish.

Tony Stewart, from the Stewart Haas Racing team, clinched the fourth position, after leading the most laps with 76. Jeff Gordon followed Stewart in fifth, while Carl Edwards could only manage sixth.

Matt Kenseth, Paul Menard, Ryan Newman, and A. J. Allmendinger rounded out the top ten finishers in the race. Other drivers in the Chase, such as Denny Hamlin finished twelfth, and Kyle Busch finished in twenty-first.

Johnson now heads the Drivers' championship with 5,503 points, eight points ahead of Denny Hamlin. Manufacturers' Ñ�hampionship standings is lead by Chevrolet with 212, thirty-seven points ahead of Toyota and 77 ahead of Ford. Once the race concluded, Johnson commented, "I know we came [into Kansas] second. Of course, I wanted to be leading. I could care less where the 11 [Hamlin] was [Sunday]. It's just not time to worry about that stuff. After Talladega, teams and drivers can work on a strategy of protecting or taking chances. We have to get deeper into the Chase to be concerned about who the points leader is."
