Sir Alan Sugar will continue to front the BBC series The Apprentice after his appointment as "enterprise tsar" for the British government. Sugar will return as host for the sixth series in the spring of next year. Sugar was previously being pushed to choose between the roles. 

The BBC released a statment saying that "The BBC is satisfied that [Sir Alan's] new role as an Enterprise Champion to the government will not compromise the BBC's impartiality or his ability to present The Apprentice." 

Critics have raised concerns over Sir Alan holding both roles. They commented that they have stated that it would breach the BBC's impartiality rules. The Conservatives said that it would be impossible for him to continue both roles. They added the fact that the next series is due to start during the build up to a possible General Election.
