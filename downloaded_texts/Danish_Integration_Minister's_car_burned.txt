Copenhagen, Denmark - The Danish Integration Minister Rikke Hvilshøj's car was set ablaze outside her family-home on the morning of Wednesday 8 June. From there, the fire spread to the family's garage, and further on to the side of the house, damaging the roof above the kitchen and children's room.

At the same time, an e-mail was sent to several media agencies, where a group calling themselves "Action Group Beate" claimed responsibility, saying it is a "protest against the racist immigrational laws of Denmark". The police found the computer used for sending the mail within a few hours, and closed down the cybercafé whilst removing the computer.

Throughout the Danish political system politicians from both the ruling party and the opposition have expressed their outrage over the terrorism.

The insurance company is currently assessing the amount of damage done to the home, but so far they have made an estimate of £27.000, just for the house damages.
