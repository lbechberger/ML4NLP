After what was almost certain defeat, Ireland's Padraig Harrington has come back to win the 136th British Open in playoff after Spain's Sergio Garcia missed what should have been a game winning putt. 

Harrington originally was knocked out of the game when he landed his ball twice in Carnoustie Golf Links' infamous Burry Burn leading him to a double bogey. However, Garica bogeyed on the same hole leading to a playoff.

The two men had tied 277, seven under par.
