United States secretary of state, Hillary Clinton stated in an interview on Mexican radio that Americans are helping to fuel the illegal drug trade between the U.S. and Mexico. Clinton was on a two day tour of the nation. 

"Our insatiable demand for illegal drugs fuels the drug trade. Our inability to prevent weapons from being illegally smuggled across the border to arm these criminals causes the death of police officers, soldiers and civilians. I feel very strongly we have a co-responsibility," said Clinton. 

Clinton also gave thanks to and praised the effort Mexico was putting forth to stop the flow of drugs over the border. "Clearly, what we have been doing has not worked and it is unfair for our incapacity...to be creating a situation where people are holding the Mexican government and people responsible."

Mexico's president, Felipe Calderón responded by saying that "binational cooperation in this area should be strengthened." Mexico has used troops in some towns in an attempt to regain control of the cities, which has resulted in many gun battles with drug cartel members and Mexican troops. Ongoing trucking disputes between the U.S. and Mexico have also contributed to an already tense situation.

Increased drug related violence in towns and cities on the Mexico – United States border has claimed more than 6,000 lives since 2008.
