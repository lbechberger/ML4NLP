Alvin K. Hellerstein, a U.S. federal judge, has ordered the release of additional photos and video relating to the on-going Abu Ghraib Iraqi prison abuse case. The media, consisting of 74 photographs and 3 videos, were ordered for release on September 29, pending a 20 day opportunity for appeal. The American Civil Liberties Union filed a Freedom of Information Act Request in a motion to release the photos.

The Bush administration has claimed that the ordered media might provoke terrorists organizations into harming more American soldiers and citizens abroad. U.S. District Judge Alvin K. Hellerstein strongly disagreed, saying that suppressing the pictures amounts to submitting to blackmail. In a statement, Hellerstein said: "Our nation [ United States ] does not surrender to blackmail, and fear of blackmail is not a legally sufficient argument to prevent us from performing a statutory command."
