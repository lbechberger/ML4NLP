Boxer Joshua Clottey of Ghana is the new International Boxing Federation welterweight champion. He beat Zab Judah of the United States Saturday night in Las Vegas, Nevada after the fight was stopped in the ninth round. The IBF title was vacant ahead of this fight.

Clottey won by a technical knockout after Judah was declared vision impaired. Judah had suffered a cut above his right eye, which was ruled an accidental headbutt by referee Robert Byrd.

Boxing analysts, however, say replays show it was caused by a punch. Since it was past the eight round, the rules of the fight called for a decision from the ringside judges.

Clottey was declared the winner 86-85 according to two judges and 87-84 by the third judge's card.

Clottey has had two previous title attempts. One ended with what the The Canadian Press calls a "bizarre disqualification" to Carlos Manuel Baldomir in 1999. The other was a unanimous point defeat to current World Boxing Association champion, Antonio Margarito after he broke his right hand in the fifth round.
