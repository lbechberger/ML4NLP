The Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) chairman Prachanda and Nepal Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala resumed the fifth round of peace talks today evening, following a meeting in the presence of UN Secretary General's representative Ian Martin held on Sunday. The aim of the peace talk was to settle the issue of arms management.

The meeting was held at Baluwatar in Nepal to finalise the political package prepared by the ruling seven-party alliance (SPA) and CPN (Maoist). They tried to narrow down the differences to reach the final conclusion on all the issues.

Prachanda held a meeting with Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist) General Secretary, Madhav Kumar Nepal, and leader of the United Leftist Front, Prabhu Narayan Chaudhari, to discuss the political package in the morning before the talks.

The submit meeting was adjourned after six and half hours long talk. It is likely to resume in Tuesday morning.

Prachanda said that he will make his first public address in twenty five year in a mass meeting in Kathmandu this Friday.
