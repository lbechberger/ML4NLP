Romania's passenger train operator, CFR Pasageri, announced today that several train services will be cancelled between March 17 and 20 on the main Bucharest-Braşov line. The cancellation is due to construction on the access road over the railway line.

CFR said that any trains running between Bucharest and Braşov, including those that proceed towards western Transylvanian cities such as Cluj-Napoca and Oradea, are to be cancelled, either for the whole route or parts thereof. The cancellation will only affect InterCity, Rapid and Accelerat trains.

The InterCity services between Târgu Mureş and Braşov, as well as the Rapid services between Galaţi and Braşov are also affected by the roadwork, as are international trains from Budapest, Prague and Vienna, which go to Bucharest via Braşov.

For passengers who wish to make alternative travel arrangements, there are frequent private coach services between Bucharest, Braşov and beyond.
