, a separatist leader, was also placed under house arrest.



Tensions began in Kashmir after recovering the corpse of a teenager named Bukhari who went missing after his arrest this morning. "A missing report had been registered in the case and a special investigating team set up to establish the facts. Whosoever is found involved in the death of the teenager will be punished," a senior police officer said.

The security men are at their level best to prevent any kind of violence. Three people were injured when the forces tried to disperse a march from Palhalan who had come attend Bukhari's funneral. Also, forces killed four others elsewhere.

The militants have ambushed three army vehicles in Rajouri and killed three policemen at a local politician's house in Sopore.

So far, 51 people have been killed in the riots and curfews since June 11, 2010 in Kashmir.
