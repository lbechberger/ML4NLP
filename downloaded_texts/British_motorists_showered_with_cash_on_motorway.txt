Drivers on Britain's M3 motorway were stunned to be confronted with a shower of cash on Tuesday evening.

Eleven thousand pounds' worth of £20 notes were blown from the rucksack of a passenger on a motorcycle at 7:30pm, while the motorway was busy with traffic.

Just £500 was recovered; the rest is believed to have been blown away in the windy evening. At least four other drivers quickly stopped, causing Hampshire police concern for safety.

The police are now investigating as to why the pair were carrying so much money. Carrying large amounts of money is not illegal, but is highly unusual. The riders said they had been to a car auction, returning empty-handed.

The motorcyclists re-started their journey, but the cycle broke down just two junctions on.
