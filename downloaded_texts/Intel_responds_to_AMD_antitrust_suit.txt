Intel has filed its response to AMD's antitrust lawsuit of June 27, 2005, saying AMD's claims are "factually incorrect and contradictory". The 63-page response, filed in federal district court in Delaware, is 15 pages longer than the original lawsuit. The strongly worded reply from Intel prompted many industry watchers to comment that the legal battle could take years to settle. According to Intel, "the evidence will show that every failure and setback for which A.M.D. today seeks to blame Intel is actually a direct result of A.M.D.'s own actions or inactions."

AMD has already issued its own rebuttal. On September 29, a federal multidistrict court in North Carolina will decide whether or not to combine many class-action suits related to the same charges.
