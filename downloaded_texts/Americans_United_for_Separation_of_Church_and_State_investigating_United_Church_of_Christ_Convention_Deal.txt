Americans United for Separation of Church and State (AU) is investigating a deal between the Governor of Connecticut, the United Church of Christ (UCC) and the Hartford Civic Center to keep the UCC's biennial convention in Connecticut. The State of Connecticut is paying the $100,000 fee for the use of the Hartford Civic Center. 

The timing of the investigation coincides with another AU investigation of the National Baptist Congress of Christian Education (NBCCE) convention being in held in Maryland this month. The State of Maryland budgeted a $150,000 grant for the annual convention. 

Rev. Barry Lynn, the Executive Director of Americans United, is also an ordained minister in the United Church of Christ .
