Two have been killed and one seriously injured in a road traffic accident in Lancashire, England. The crash involved a driver in a green Rover mounting the pavement of a street in Accrington at 1500 GMT yesterday. Two pedestrians were hit by the Rover, travelling at approximately 30 miles per hour.

All three involved were taken to the Royal Blackburn Hospital by ambulance. There, the currently unidentified 89-year-old male driver died. The accident also seriously injured 30-year-old mother Jackie Bloomer. Her eighteen-month-old son Jayden, who was in a stroller that she was pushing at the time of the crash, died in hospital. Bloomer was later transferred to the Royal Preston Hospital, where she is currently being treated for serious injuries.

Lancashire Constabulary are currently appealing for anyone who was a witness to the crash to come forward, stated that they suspect the elderly driver had a heart attack and collapsed while driving. Sergeant Pete Sculpher, from the Accrington Road Policing Unit, said, "[t]his is a tragic incident and our thoughts go out to both families involved. The collision happened on one of the busiest roads in Accrington at a time when many people would be picking children up from school so I would ask anyone that saw anything to come forward and speak to police."
