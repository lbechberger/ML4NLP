Armenia's defense minister Seyran Ohanian has announced that nation will contribute troops to the ISAF forces in Afghanistan.

Colonel Seyran Shahsuvarian told Radio Free Europe (RFE/RL) that an Armenian military official is discussing the details of the deployment at a NATO planning conference in Germany. Armenia, as part of the USSR, has previously participated in the failed Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in the 1980s, and veterans have expressed a willingness to return to the front according to the Associated Press (AP). As of yet, no details have been revealed to the public of how many servicemen will be sent and from which branch of service they will come. Unnamed officials said Armenia is likely to send munitions experts or communications officers.

Armenia has participated in other Western military operations, including those in Kosovo and Iraq. About 50 Armenian sappers, military doctors, and other non-combat personnel served in Iraq until last autumn, leaving when the Polish contingent to which they were attached was withdrawn.
