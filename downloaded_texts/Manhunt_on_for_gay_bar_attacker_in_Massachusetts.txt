Authorities have killed the man sought in connection with an attack on patrons of a gay bar in New Bedford, Massachusetts Wednesday night, February 1. Jacob D. Robida, 18, of New Bedford was wanted on suspicion of three counts of attempted murder and hate crimes.

Robida entered Puzzles Lounge around 11:30 pm Wednesday night and asked if it was a gay bar. The bartender said yes and served Robida a drink acquired with a fake ID.

After finishing the drink and ordering a second one, Robida moved to the back of the bar where a game of pool was being played and started swinging a hatchet at a customer's head. While the bartender was calling the police, Robida struck a second patron with the hatchet and then pulled out a gun shooting the first victim in the face and the second twice in the head. A third person was also shot.

Robida was captured Saturday February 4, 2006 in Norfork, Arkansas after a gunfight with police. A police chase began after Robida killed a police officer who pulled him over for a routine traffic stop. After his car was spotted on Arkansas Highway 201 he was chased into Norfork and stopped at a police barricade. Once stopped Robida killed the passenger in his car and fired on police. At this point the police returned fire and shot Robida twice in the head, and he was then taken to a hospital in Springfield, Missouri.

Robida died at 3:38 a.m. Sunday February 5, 2006 as a result of his injuries. The female passenger who was traveling with Robida and was killed before the shoot out with police has been identified as Jennifer Rena Bailey of Charleston, West Virginia. She appears to have had a prior relationship with Robida, however his reason for picking her up and later killing her is still unknown.
