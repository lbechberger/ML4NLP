Pakistani officials have stated that a missile strike — suspected to have been launched from an American unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) — killed at least ten militants in North Waziristan, a tribal area near Pakistan's border with Afghanistan on Tuesday.

The attack targeted a Taliban-operated compound in the village of Dargamandi. It was the second attack in the vicinity within 24 hours. On Monday, five people were killed following a similar attack targeting a Islamic school in the Machikhel village.

Unmanned aircraft operated by the US are believed to have launched over forty missiles into northwestern Pakistan, a stronghold of the Taliban in the past few months.

The strikes were initiated after a suicide bomber killed at least 21 people at a border checkpoint last week.
