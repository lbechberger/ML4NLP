Near the western tip of Cuba, a poorly organized Tropical Depression has formed, the first of the 2006 tropical storm season in the Atlantic Ocean.

The thundershowers and torrential rain lie east of the center. However, over the weekend, if persistent convection develops closer to the center of circulation, the tropical depression could become Tropical Storm Alberto. 

This is the first T.D. of the 2006 Atlantic hurricane season. Some of the rain will hit the north-eastern part of the Yucatan Peninsula, but the bulk of the heaviest rain will remain east of the tropical depression over the western half of Cuba where 10 to 30 inches are possible by early Monday.

Deadly flash flooding and mudslides are possible. Grand Cayman picked up 22.7 inches of rain in the last 24 hours. From Sunday into Tuesday, the heavy rain will hit Florida and could become a good source of drought relief for much of the state. 

In the Pacific Ocean, clusters of thunderstorms extend westward from Central America to just south of Mexico. Any thunderstorms over land could produce flooding and mudslides in the higher elevations. Slow development of a low pressure system off the coast of Guatemala is possible over the next few days as it heads northwestward to along the southern Mexican shores.
