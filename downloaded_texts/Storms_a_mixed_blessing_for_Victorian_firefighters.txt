Firefighters in the Australian state of Victoria have received a mixed blessing overnight as storms crossed the state.

The Anakie fire in the state's west received a fair amount of rain helping firefighters to contain the fire.

The Kinglake fire North-East of Melbourne also received rain, but helped firefighters very little.

The large Grampians fire in the state's west and the fire at Moondarra in the Gippsland region did not receive any rain. The storms did however spark two spot fires alongside the Grampians fire.
