Kasey Kahne rode into victory early Sunday morning at Richmond International Raceway in the state of Virginia, USA, in his first Nascar Nextel Cup victory. Kahne, who drives a Dodge, and is sponsored by the same company, won automaker competitor Chevrolet's sponsored race, the Chevy American Revolution 400.

The 25-year old from Huntersville, North Carolina had previously gained the pole position for Saturday's night race on Friday. Early in the race, second-place finisher Tony Stewart took lead from Kahne, continuing on to lead over 100 cumulative laps in the race. At lap 234 of 400, Stewart spun out coming out of the fourth turn, which resulted in Kahne regaining the lead. After two more lead changes between the two, Kahne led the last 7 laps to take the checkered flag.

Points leader Jimmie Johnson crashed his car early into the race, taking a last-place finish. He continues to lead the cup series in points.
