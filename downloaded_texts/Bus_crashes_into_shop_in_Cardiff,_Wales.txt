A public bus has crashed into a shop in Cardiff, Wales. No one is believed to have been injured.

The nearly-empty bus was leaving the Cardiff central bus depot in Wood Street at approximately 7pm local time when witness say it failed to complete a left turn onto St. Mary Street, instead crashing into the shuttered doors of the Pure Rugby sport memorabilia shop. The shop was closed and empty at the time. Police and an ambulance were called to the scene of the accident and the area was cordoned off; St. Mary Street was closed to bus traffic and buses throughout the city centre were put on alternate routes for the evening.

While South Wales, along with much of Great Britain, has suffered from icy conditions in recent weeks, roads and sidewalks were clear. The accident comes three days after a three-bus collision injured a driver on Westgate Street, one street over from St. Mary Street.
