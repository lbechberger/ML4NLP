An earthquake measuring 6.9 on the Richter Scale has been reported off the coast of Japan's main island, HonshÅ«.

Whilst a major earthquake, the epicentre was well away from any population centres, and initial tsunami warnings predicting half-meter surges were later withdrawn.

Due to its size, the quake was felt in Tokyo, over 300 miles away.
