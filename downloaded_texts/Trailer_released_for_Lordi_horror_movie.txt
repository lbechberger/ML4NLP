A short trailer for the movie Dark Floors, a horror starring Finnish theatrical hard rock band Lordi, has been released. 

The film, set in a hospital, follows a group of people left trapped by a broken lift as they are attacked by monsters, and focuses heavily on one particular patient, a little autistic girl.

Dark Floors, acted in English by a largely Finnish cast, cost â‚¬4.2 million (approximately US$6 million) to make. It will make its full premiere in Finland on February 8, 2008, although advance screenings will begin this year.

Lordi recently attended the Cannes Film Festival to promote the movie, where the band's lead vocalist and frontman described it as a "traditional modern horror" and promised "horrific scenes."
