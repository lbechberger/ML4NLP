Westmeath managed to beat Donegal by the narrowest of margins in a thrilling game at Mullingar's Cusack Park earlier today. The Allianz NFL Division 1A clash had been tipped to end in a draw, but a late burst of energy by the lakelanders ensured a victory. 

Both teams scored a goal with Colm McFadden and Dessie Dolan both finding the back of the net, however both teams had several missed chances; with Ryan Bradley hitting the woodwork in an early penalty and Martin Flanagan unable to beat the goalie.

The final score was 1-12 to 1-11.
