The US Department of Justice in Washington, DC was temporarily evacuated Monday morning when a suspicious package was found on a nearby bus.

According to city transport officials, a vagrant had left a coat on the bus and an investigation by police had revealed this not to be a threat.

The evacuation, it was stressed, was purely a precautionary measure.
