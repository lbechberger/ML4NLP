Six people were arrested in northern England today under immigration laws. The arrests were made in a suburb of Leeds, where two of the suspected bombers of the London terrorist attacks lived. 

However the police say they are not linking the arrests with the London bombings. Early reports had suggested that the men had been arrested under anti-terrorism laws as part of the London bombing investigation, a statement on the West Yorkshire Police website said they were working closely with the Metropolitan Police as part of their enquiry, but at the current stage they were not linking the arrests with the recent incidents in London.

All six men remain in police custody and West Yorkshire Police have yet to release more details about the arrests.
