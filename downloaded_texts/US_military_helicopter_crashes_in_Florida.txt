The United States military has said that a MH-53 Pave Low military helicopter carrying seven soldiers crashed during a routine training mission in Florida near Eglin Air Force Base late Friday night.

At least two of the soldiers suffered non-life threatening injuries, while the other five were unhurt and are being kept in the hospital for further evaluation. No civilians were injured and no damage was caused to civilian property.

The cause of the crash is not known and the military states that the crash is under investigation.

"A board of officers will investigate the accident. As soon as additional details become available, they will be provided," said a statement posted on the website for Eglin AFB.

The soldiers were with the 20th Special Operations Squadron from Hurlburt Field in Florida.
