Senator George Voinovich (R-Ohio) provided a critical vote today to send John R. Bolton to the Senate for a vote on his nomination. Bolton is President Bush's nominee for United States ambassador to the United Nations.

The highly controversial and contested nominee has come under scrutiny from members of both parties for his political stance concerning the United Nations. Senator Voinovich previously voted "no", stopping the nomination from leaving the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Now that Voinovich is voting "yes", the nomination can be put before the full Senate for a vote. 

However, the Senator issued scathing remarks concerning Bolton, referring to him as a "bully" and claiming that he is a disgrace to the nation. Also, Voinovich stated that he would vote "no" in the Senate to Bolton's confirmation.
