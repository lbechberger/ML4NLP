Ottawa announced several proposed amendments to the Canadian Copyright Act, including signing onto two World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) treaties and requiring Internet Service Providers to keep records on users who transfer many files online.

According to the announcement, the changes would "clarify that the unauthorized posting or the peer-to-peer file-sharing of material on the Internet will constitute an infringement of copyright."

Recording industry representatives were ecstatic with the news. "This is terrific news," said Graham Henderson, who heads the Canadian Recording Industry Association. "Clearly, once we get implementation there will be no doubt ... it will be illegal to engage in unauthorized file-sharing."
