Six-year-old Christopher Michael Barrios, Jr. has been missing since Thursday night. He was last seen near his home in the Canal Mobile Home Park just north of Brunswick, Georgia. 

He is a hispanic/black male, 3'06" - 4'00", and 60-70 lbs. He has short black hair and brown eyes, and was last seen wearing a blue or green long sleeve shirt with a white T-shirt underneath and long black pants. He also was wearing white tennis shoes with a blue stripe on the side with a velcro closure on top.

Police say neighbors spotted a white car driving slowly in the area, but they are not sure if the car has anything to do with Christopher's disappearance.

If you know anything about this you are asked to call the Glynn County police at 912-554-7803 or First Coast Crime Stoppers at 1-866-845-TIPS (1-866-845-8477). There is a $27,000 reward for the return of the missing boy.
