The family of the 19 year old who was 'murdered' in a pub car park two days ago have made a statement regarding the death of their child. They said that "Jack is obviously dearly missed by all of his family. He was a much loved son and brother."

"Nothing can ever fill the hole that has been left in our lives," they continued. "We know that Jack had a lot of friends, but we have been amazed by the amount of messages that people have left. "

The family continued "we can not believe Jack has gone, we all keep expecting him to walk back in. Jack was an angel, he was amazing."

The death, which was treated as murder, resulted in two arrests. The murder, which occurred on Wednesday evening, took place near Highridge Road in Bishopsworth, Bristol.
