France yesterday ended Ireland's dream of winning the Grand Slam - European Rugby's top title. The RBS Six Nations clash, which took place at Dublin's Lansdowne Road finished with the French team ahead on 26 points against Ireland's 19.

After a French dominated first half, Ireland had a glimmer of hope as Brian O'Driscoll managed to get a try almost from nothing mid-way through the second half, sadly for the homeside, it wasn't enough as France responded with a second try to take them to 26 ponits.
