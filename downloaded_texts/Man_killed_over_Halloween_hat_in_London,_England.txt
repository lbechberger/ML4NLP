A man was beaten to death in London after he attempted to retrieve a Halloween hat that had been stolen from his girlfriend. Ben Gardner was on a night out with his girlfriend to celebrate Halloween when his girlfriend's witchâ€™s hat was stolen and spat in by a gang of people. 

When Gardner tried to get the hat back he was repeatedly punched and kicked by a group of people who appeared to be both men and women. The attack happened at 3:30 a.m. on Sunday morning. His girlfriend was also punched during the attack. 

Gardner died in hospital on Sunday evening after the attack in Sutton, in the south of London. Detective Inspector Bob Campany released a statement saying "This appears to be a violent unprovoked attack on an innocent man who was out enjoying Halloween night with his girlfriend."

Five men and two women are being questioned by police. Another man has been questioned but released with no further action being taken.
