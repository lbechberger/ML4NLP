US Representative John Conyers (D-MI) has brought three resolutions to the House which could begin a censure process of President Bush and Vice President Cheney, and begin an investigation. 

The first of the three resolutions, H.RES.635, would create a select committee to investigate the Administration's intent to go to war before congressional authorization, manipulation of pre-war intelligence, encouraging and countenancing torture, retaliating against critics, and to make recommendations regarding grounds for possible impeachment. 

The second, H.RES.636, calls for Censuring President George W. Bush for failing to respond to requests for information concerning allegations that he and others in his Administration misled Congress and the American people regarding the decision to go to war in Iraq, misstated and manipulated intelligence information regarding the justification for the war, countenanced torture and cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment of persons in Iraq, and permitted inappropriate retaliation against critics of his Administration, for failing to adequately account for specific misstatements he made regarding the war, and for failing to comply with Executive Order 12958.

The third, H.RES.637, calls for censuring Vice President Richard B. Cheney for reasons similar to those outlined in H.RES.636.

Rep. Conyers is the sole sponsor of all three resolutions, but Rep. John Lewis (D-GA) has joined Conyers in calling for an investigation of President Bush's handling of pre-war intelligence. Lewis released a statement Monday 12/19/05 using strong language to condemn the president. "In my opinion, the President has violated the law, and the House and Senate must pursue their inquiries into this illegal program."
