According to police investigating the death of a 2-year old boy in Hidalgo County, Texas, the boy's death may have been caused by a morbidly obese relative who fell on him, fracturing his skull.

"It didn't look like there was any foul play," according to Justice of the Peace Bobby Conteras. The boy was pronounced dead on Tuesday.

The boy was dropped off at the relative's house to spend the day there, according to the boy's mother. County Sheriff Lupe TreviÃ±o, who called the death "suspicious," is reported to be waiting for an official cause of death before making a decision to file charges or not.

The identity of the child is not yet known.
