Superman returned to theatres for the first time in nearly 20 years, when Superman Returns opened on Wednesday. The film earned $21 million on its first day of showing, making it the eighth biggest box-office draw ever for a Wednesday opening in North America.

The film has so far received generally positive reviews from the media. It is directed by Bryan Singer, who also did the first two X-Men films. Superman is played by Brandon Routh, and Lois Lane by Kate Bosworth, with Lex Luthor played by Kevin Spacey. It is the first Superman film since 1987's Superman IV: The Quest for Peace.
