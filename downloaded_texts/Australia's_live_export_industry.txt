According to the Australian Governments Department of Agriculture, the Australian Government does not tolerate cruelty towards animals. Yet Australiaâ€™s foremost national animal protection organisation, Animals Australia protest that live exporting in itself is animal cruelty, with 37 open investigations of abuse in countries around the world. Animals Australia claim many of the cattle die before they even get to their destination and the ones that do endure torture and are brutally slaughtered. 

As stated by the Australian Standards for the Export of Livestock (version 2.3), the country importing determines animal health and any other requirements for imported livestock and may advise the Australian Government of these from time to time. The Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service will provide a health certificate and the export permit when they are satisfied that the livestock being exported meet the importing countries requirements. 

Along with the 37 open investigations Animals Australia also has provided camera footage of identified Australian Sheep to ABC television show 7:30 of animals being tied by their feet and being bundled into car boots outside markets in Vietnam to be taken away for slaughter. 
 
Once the livestock has reached its destination and survived the journey, many of these animals endure routine abuse and brutal slaughter in places where laws do not protect them from cruelty. The Australian Standards for the Export of Livestock (version 2.3) may need an amendment to help protect Australian cattle when overseas. Stricter laws on live export and the welfare of the livestock could potentially save thousands of animals from torture overseas.
