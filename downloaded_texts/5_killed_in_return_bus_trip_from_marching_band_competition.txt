5 people were killed in a bus crash involving a truck on the return trip from a band marching competition from the University of Wisconsin-Whitewater.

The band director, his wife and granddaughter, the bus driver and a student were the five killed.

30 others were injured in the crash.

The bus was the first of four buses carrying 200 students home from the competition. The band was happy that they had placed third with their selection 'Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves'.

A Whole Foods Market truck had veered off the road and when it tried to get back it jackknifed and blocked all lanes of traffic, according to Capt. Doug Notbohm, the northwest regional commander for the Wisconsin State Patrol.

The truck driver did not sustain life-threatening injuries and was questioned by investigators at the scene of the accident.

Weather was not a factor, and toxicology tests were administered, said Notbohm.

At least 400 worried parents and students went to the school to gather information about the accident. Counselors and clergy were present to help cope with the rising emotions.
