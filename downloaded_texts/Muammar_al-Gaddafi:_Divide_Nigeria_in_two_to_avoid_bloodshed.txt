Libyan leader Muammar al-Gaddafi has said that Nigeria should be divided into two separate nations to avoid further violence between Muslims and Christians. He was quoted as saying that the spilt "would stop the bloodshed and burning of places of worship." 

During his speech to students, Gaddafi spoke about the partition of India. He called that division a "historic, radical solution" which saved the lives of "millions of Hindus and Muslims," despite reports that one million people were killed. 

He also called the recent violence in Jos a "deep conflict of a religious nature," and put the blame on the British stating that the federal state was imposed by Britain. 

Around 100 people have died already this year in violence near the city of Jos. A senior Nigerian diplomat responded to Gaddafi's comments saying that he "did not take the suggestion seriously."
