A Chilean policeman, GermÃ¡n Hugo Ulloa Valdivia, died after falling from a seven meter high roof, during a foot pursuit in Santiago on Tuesday. Ulloa was pursuing some criminals who tried to rob a computer store.

The policeman was taken to the Hospital de Carabineros (Carabiniers Hospital) where, despite medical efforts, he died on Thursday after the serious injuries caused by the fall.

Carabineros de Chile said in a statement that they were saddened by the "sudden death of one of our functionaries, afforded by the unconditional support of his wife and his three children, [we] distinguish his bravery and commitment to service of [the person] who gave his life for the well-being of the community." 

Ulloa worked twenty years in Carabineros de Chile.
