British singer Susan Boyle has been released from a private mental clinic. On May 31, Boyle was admitted by ambulance to the Priory clinic in London, England after she began to act strange in her hotel room, reportedly suffering an "emotional breakdown."

Boyle's brother, Gerry Boyle, told GMTV that Susan is "a lot more like herself," and that she is "much happier." He also added that Boyle is "now beginning to believe that, 'Yes indeed, I will be a singer.'"

Boyle, 47, from Blackburn, West Lothian, in Scotland, came in second place on the British reality show Britain's Got Talent (BGT). Boyle was beaten by the dance group Diversity on Saturday who got 24% of the public vote, with Boyle receiving 20%. She took the world by storm after her debut appearance on April 11 singing "I Dreamed a Dream" from the award-winning musical Les MisÃ©rables. Just a day after appearing on the show, Boyle became a YouTube sensation with her performance receiving nearly 9 million views. To date, the YouTube clip has been viewed by over 66 million people worldwide.

Traditionally, finalists of the show go on a concert tour of the UK, although producers for Britain's Got Talent will not say whether Boyle plans to be a part of it. A spokesperson stated they are respecting Boyle's privacy amid her health concerns. Rehearsals for the tour are reported to begin next week, with the first show starting on June 12.
