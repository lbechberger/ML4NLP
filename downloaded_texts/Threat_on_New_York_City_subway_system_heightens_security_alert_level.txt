A "credible threat" has been made against the subway system of New York City. NYPD and National Guard presence, as well as the terror alert level, have been increased. Nevertheless, the MTA subways and busses, as well as Metro-North and Long Island Rail Road, continued without noticeable delays.

During a press conference, Mayor Bloomberg stated that an unidentified news outlet knew about the threat as many as two days in advance, but did not release the story to the public for security reasons, and that the threat seems to have originated from abroad.

Part of New York's Pennsylvania Station was closed off Friday, the morning after a warning of a possible terrorist attack. The station was still operating but the area where the Amtrak trains operate was closed off. It seems a soda can was seen on the concourse level with a green liquid bubbling out. Workers in bio-hazard suits were seen and after a 2 hour delay the station was back to normal. Amtrak operations were not impacted.

While New York was on high-alert The Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Russ Knocke down-played the risk, "the intelligence community has concluded this information to be of doubtful credibility. We shared this information early on with state and local authorities in New York"
