Radioactive water is leaking from the nuclear waste store in Forsmark, Sweden. The content of radioactive caesium in sampled water is ten times the normal value. Statens strÃ¥lskyddsinstitut (SSI, the Swedish Radiation Protection Authority) believes that the leakage originates from waste barrels that have corroded, since the radioactive water is leaking out from the waste disposal area of the Forsmark power plant. The radiation is, however, still within the allowed limits according to SSI. The waste is low and intermediate level waste. No high level waste has been reported. A new roof is to be constructed for the chamber containing the barrels.
