Hazmat crews shut down and diverted traffic in the Holland Tunnel leading into New York City when a suspicious package was discovered after an accident.

Reports say that the package was found near the entrance of the tunnel outside a gas station in Jersey City on the Jersey Avenue and 12th Street intersection and that the toll booths at the tunnel's entrance have been closed.

Police used a robot to detonate the package, but it is not yet known what was inside the package.

Shortly after 8:00 a.m. (eastern time) the tunnel was reopened to traffic.
