According to reports from BBC News Online and Sky News Online, a maximum of 270,000 civil servants will go on a strike in the United Kingdom due to a dispute over reductions to redundancy terms in the public sector. Staff that are due to get involved in the strike, which will last for 48 hours between the dates of March 8–9 2010, will include driving test examiners, court officials, coastguards, tax workers, customs officers, and members of staff from Jobcentre Plus.

The UK Government has stated that the money that will be salvaged by the taxpayer after the modifications will amount to £500 million (US$760 million, €564 million). Individuals who are members of the Public and Commercial Services Union (PCS) took part in a vote in February 2010. The union announced that 81% of members had voted in favour of a ban of working overtime, and that 63% of those polled supported blockages.

Mark Serwotka, General Secretary of the British trade union for civil servants stated that "[t]hese cuts, which will see loyal civil and public servants lose tens of thousands of pounds if they are forced out of a job, are more about crude politicking than making savings. We have suggested ways in which the Government can make these savings whilst protecting the rights of existing members, yet it seems intent on penalising the people who keep this country running."
