The delegation representing Brazil at the funeral of Yasser Arafat returned today, November 13, 2004. The chief-minister of Civil House José Dirceu was a member of the delegation. Unfortunately they arrived too late for the funeral and the delegation watched only part of the funeral activities.

PCdoB (Brazilian communist political party) Deputy Jamil Murad, member of the delegation, said there was a "deep mourning" feeling. Jamil Murad had visited Yasser Arafat in April 2004, along with nine other Brazilian deputies. According to Jamil Murad: "Yasser Arafat was a Palestinian leader who became a world projection leader". He said Arafat had written him a letter thanking the Brazilian people for their support of the Palestinian cause and saying that he, Arafat, considered President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva a great world leader.
