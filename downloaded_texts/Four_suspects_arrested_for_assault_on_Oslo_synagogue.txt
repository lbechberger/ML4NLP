The Norwegian police have arrested and charged four men, aged between 20 and 30 for an assault on a synagogue in Oslo at 2:30 am on Sunday, September 17th. 

The four arrested are from different ethnic backgrounds and can be detained up to three days before appearing in front of a judge. Police have not ruled out further arrests over the incident.

At least 10 shots were fired at the synagogue. Nobody was injured in the incident. It is believed that the attack was carried out with an assault rifle. 

The Mosaic Religious Community, which owns the site had requested better protection following threats and an incident of vandalism last month.
