John Kerry's Yale transcript was released as a part of his naval records late last month.

A number of American news sources have drawn attention to the fact it shows that Kerry's grades were slightly lower than George W. Bush's. This is contrary to popular perception, which portrays Kerry as an "intellectual" and Bush as a "regular guy". Bush's transcript was published in 1999 by The New Yorker. Kerry earned a 76 percent cumulative average during his four years at Yale, while Bush earned a 77 percent his first three years and a similar average his fourth year under a non-numerical grading system. Both Bush and Kerry began their memberships in Skull and Bones while at Yale.
