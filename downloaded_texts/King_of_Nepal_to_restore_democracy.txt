In an address to the nation, the king of Nepal, Gyanendra said that he was turning the nation pro-democratic.

"We are committed to multi-party democracy and a constitutional monarchy. Executive power of the kingdom of Nepal, which was in our safekeeping, shall from this day be returned to the people. We hope peace and order is restored to the country by protecting multi-party democracy. We ask the seven-party alliance to recommend the name for the post of prime minister at the earliest," said the king in his address to the nation today.

Girija Prasad Koirala, the former Prime Minister of Nepal and leader of the opposition alliance said he will meet and discuss the announcement made by the king, before responding.

Earlier, United States Ambassador James Moriarty, had said that "his [the king's] time is running out" and that "ultimately the king will have to leave if he doesn't compromise. And by 'ultimately' I mean sooner rather than later."
