Tropical Storm Henri (pronounced awn-'REE), the eight named storm of the 2009 Atlantic hurricane season, formed on Tuesday approximately 600 miles east of the Leeward Islands.


The storm currently has winds of about 40 miles per hour (65 kilometres per hour), with slightly higher gusts. Henri is moving north-northeast at 18 mph (30 kph).

The storm is predicted to be weak and short-lived, avoiding any land masses. The tropical storm could die out as soon as Wednesday. 

However, the storm's intensification has already surprised some meteorologists: "The formation of Henri illustrates how difficult it is to anticipate the changes in convection that distinguish strong tropical disturbances from weak tropical cyclones", said a National Hurricane Center forecaster.
