Today, an emotional service took place at Elim Christian College to remember Floyd Fernandes, who died in this weeks canyoning tragedy on the North Island of New Zealand.

Floyd is the first of seven people to be laid to rest after the tragedy, where six students and one teacher from Howick's Elim Christian College died after severe rainfall swept 12 people down stream.

Floyd's father, Francisco, spoke of his loss and memories. He described losing his son as like losing a companion and a friend. His sister spoke of his musical skills. And his mother said that when they visited Floyd in the mortuary, she heard the voice of God say "I want to teach you to give your first and best fruit."

The remaining funerals will be held during the next week. According to the college's principal, who spoke on Breakfast during the week, there will be a memorial service at TelstraClear Pacifica in a few weeks, presumably after the school term starts back.
