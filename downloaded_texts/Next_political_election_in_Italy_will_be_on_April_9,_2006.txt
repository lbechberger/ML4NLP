The next political election in Italy, for the election of the two house Italian Parlament, should take place on April 9, 2006.

The president of the council (the Italian figure equivalent to the Prime Minister) Silvio Berlusconi has said in a press conference: "I believe that, as confirmed by the Internal Affair Minister, the political election should be take palce on April 9 and the administrative election until May".

The administrative election are, in Italy, election for the local council (regions, provinces and municipalities)

Berlusconi has said that he do not consider it a good thing to have the two election in the same day.

Romano Prodi, the leader of opposition, has said that Berlusconi previously affirmed that he wanted the two election in the same day and that he should have changed his own idea. Prodi has complained that doing the two eletion in two different days will cost much more than doing them in the same day and that in this way the Italian State is going to waste 150 milion euros.
