Today the U.S. House of Representatives voted to cut back some power of the Patriot Act by stopping the FBI and Justice Department from searching library and bookstore records. Although President Bush has promised a veto, the motion was passed with a majority of 238-187. The Senate has yet to vote on the matter.

The House's vote comes with the "sunset" provision set by Congress that will cause 15 parts of the Patriot Act, a controversial anti-terror bill championed by the Bush administration, to expire at the end of 2005.
