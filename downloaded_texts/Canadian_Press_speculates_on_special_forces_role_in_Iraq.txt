Canadian news agency the Canadian Press (CP) is speculating that Canadian Forces soldiers, specifically the elite Joint Task Force 2 unit, may have been involved in the rescue of two Canadian hostages in Baghdad, Iraq, James Loney and Harmeet Singh Sooden, Christian Peacemaker Team members both held hostage there since November 2005.

Prime Minister Stephen Harper has refused to answer questions about whether these troops were involved. It would be significant to Canadians if their troops were involved in Iraq, as Canada previously refused to contribute troops to the US-led invasion of Iraq.
