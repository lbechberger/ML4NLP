Recent heavy hailstorms occurring at approximately 4 o'clock in the afternoon today left parts of Sydney with the appearance of being snowed in, with thick blankets of hail covering streets and sidewalks with layers of hail.

The hail was observed in the Central Business District of Sydney, where cars were observed -- possibly sheltering from the worst of the downfall -- under awnings on Paramatta Road, and areas in the Inner West.

The Bureau of Meteorology's Sydney Harbour weather station recorded a drop in temperature with the storm: at 4pm the temperature was 17 degrees Celsius, while the temperature reached a low at 11 degrees half an hour later.
