West Indies have beaten England by 61 runs in the second One-Day International of the West Indies tour of England at Edgbaston, Birmingham, England.

West Indies recorded a challenging total of 278-5. Shivnarine Chanderpaul scored 116 not out off 122 balls to post his seventh century in One-Day Internationals. Marlon Samuels scored 77, while Chris Gayle and Devon Smith shared an opening partnership of 50.

The England batsmen struggled in comparison, with opener Alastair Cook departing for just 19 and a controversial LBW decision for Ian Bell reducing them to 30-2. Top scorers for England were Matt Prior with 52 and Owais Shah with 45. Ravi Rampaul was the pick of the West Indian bowlers with 4-41.

Conditions at Edgbaston were damp, with rain interrupting the match on three occasions.
