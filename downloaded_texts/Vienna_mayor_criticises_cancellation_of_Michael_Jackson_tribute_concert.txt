The mayor of Vienna has criticised the cancellation of the original Michael Jackson tribute concert that was due to take place on September 26 in Vienna, Austria.

Michael HÃ¤upl, the mayor of Vienna, has said: "[The show would have been] very interesting... had it been properly prepared and organised but it was not." The tribute concert, which was due to take place in Austria on September 26, was organised mainly by Jermaine Jackson, Michael Jackson's brother.

Funding for the original concert had been cancelled on September 11 due to the fact that many top stars such as Natalie Cole, Mary J. Blige and Chris Brown couldn't make the concert because, as Jermaine Jackson said, "Numerous stars were just not able to change their schedules".

A replacement concert is now due to take place in London, England at some point in June 2010.
