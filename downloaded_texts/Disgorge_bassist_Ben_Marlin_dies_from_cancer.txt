Ben Marlin, bassist for American brutal death metal band Disgorge, died Wednesday after a lengthy battle with cancer.

San Diego-based Disgorge announced his death in the following statement:

"We are regretful to say that after nearly a year and a half of battling cancer, our brother and bass player Ben Marlin has passed away just about the stroke of 5 a.m. this January 2nd, 2008. We are going to miss him so much and may he live on in all our hearts forever. Ben, thank you for all your years of friendship and brutality."

Upon hearing of Marlin's death Ruud Lemmen of Neurotic Records released the following statement:

"It is with great regret that I've just learned about Ben losing his battle with cancer. Ben was a great friend, and the time he spent in Europe with Disgorge (especially the nights off at my own home) have been nothing but great. Ben was a good guy, a funny fellow and I will never forget him. For one, I can't even imagine how thrilled I was when he took off his own personal, extremely limited Cranial Impalement (early band demo) long-sleeve and threw it my way, saying, 'Hey bro, it's yours.' This is just one of many perfect examples that showed what kind of humble person Ben was. My condolences go out to friends, family and band members."
