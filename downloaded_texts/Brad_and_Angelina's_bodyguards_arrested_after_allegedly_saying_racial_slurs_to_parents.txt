Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie's bodyguards have been accused of saying racial slurs to parents of an Islamic school in south Mumbai, India. The parents have told the media that the bodyguards said "YOU BLOODY INDIANS AND YOU BLOODY MUSLIMS" when they came to pick up their children from the school. The 3 bodyguards were arrested and later released on surety of Rs 25,000.

Brad Pitt appeared in an interview with NDTV and denied all charges on the bodyguards. He said that the bodyguards were fathers too and would never say such a thing. Pitt also said that he would have never even chosen bodyguards who weren't tolerant towards other religions. "I have to say that we are horrified by these allegations," Pitt said in an interview for NDTV, which will broadcast tonight. 

The incident occurred when the gates of the school, in which they were filming, were opened up to allow parents to pick up their children.
