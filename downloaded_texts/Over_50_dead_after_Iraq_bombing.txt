A bombing in the Iraqi capital of Baghdad has killed 51 people, according to local police. The car bomb exploded near a bus stop in the Hurriya area, which is mainly populated with Shia Muslims. 75 people were also wounded by the attack.

This bombing, which set over twenty shops alight, has a higher death toll than any other bombing in Baghdad over the last three months. 

The attack follows an effort by the Iraqi and US forces to increase the security situation in Iraq, which has suffered many attacks since the 2003 invasion by coalition forces.
