Although the next U.S. presidential election is more than three years away, U.S. senator Joseph Biden (Democrat â€“ Delaware) has already announced his intentions of running. Although he originally said in December 2004 that he would wait two years to make a decision, he told Face The Nation on Sunday that he will spend this year trying to "explore his support", adding, "[I'm going to take my] game on the road, letting people know what I think." He also told the CBS news show that he will make his decision as to whether or not to pursue the party's nomination towards the end of this year.

Should he decide to pursue the nomination, Biden may be vying for the nomination alongside several others, including former first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, 2004 Democratic candidate John Kerry, and Indiana senator Evan Bayh.

Described by Ron Williams in an opinion piece as, "the walking definition of a professional politician," Biden has been vocal in his opposition to the war in Iraq. He is a top-ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee where he receives press coverage for his criticism of the U.S. administration's handling of the war.

Biden ran an unsuccessful bid for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1988. Political analysts generally believe that Biden's early announcement for the presidency is good strategy when the hopeful presidential field includes other Democratic heavy weights.
