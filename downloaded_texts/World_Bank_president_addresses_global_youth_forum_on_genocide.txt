The president of the World Bank, Paul Wolfowitz, has addressed a global youth forum on genocide in Kigali, Rwanda, today, as part of a visit to four African countries this week.

Speaking on genocide, he said: "people say 'never again' too easily, It's happening today in Sudan. We all share responsibility to actually do things. The conditions of preventing genocide lie partly in helping people to have a better life. It's easier to incite people that have nothing to lose."

Asked why the international community ignored past genocide, Wolfowitz said: "There are many explanations but no excuses. We have to work with countries that are working to prevent conflict."

He said he would work together with African countries to cut poverty, citing Tony Blair's phrase of a 'deal for a deal': "So many governments here are stepping up to take responsibility.". He added that World Bank assistance to service debt repayments could now go towards meeting needs, following the cancellations of the debts of the 18 poorest countries agreed by G8 countries last week.

The forum organised by Never Again, which began at the Kigali Institute for Science and Technology today, has participants from Rwanda, the Congo, Burundi, the United States and Canada.

The forum continues today and includes discussions on the future of the Great Lakes region and the international community's responsibility to protect against genocide.
