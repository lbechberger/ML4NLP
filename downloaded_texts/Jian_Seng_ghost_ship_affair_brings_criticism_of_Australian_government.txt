Criticism was targeted to Government efforts in the affair of the Jian Seng in the Australian Senate March 28 and 29 over the handling of the ghost
ship, the tanker Jian Seng, which was found abandoned and unlit in
the Gulf of Carpentaria.

Senator Joe Ludwig (Labor,
Queensland) asked of the Minister for Justice and Customs Senator
Chris Ellison in Question Time whether he stood by his claim that
he made yesterday that the discovery of the Jian Seng demonstrated that the
Australian Government had in place "aerial and maritime surveillance to
intercept a vessel in these circumstances, and that was done", and asked why it
took the Government two weeks to intercept the vessel after it entered
Australian waters. Senator Ellison responded that at the vessel's first
sighting on March 8 "it was not doing anything illegal", and criticised the
Opposition's claim that the ship was drifting for seventeen days, saying
that "it was not stated as having drifted for the whole of the 17 days". Ludwig
went on to note that it was not Customs that spotted the ship but a "passing
Australian barge", but Ellison had defended this, stating that Ludwig "thinks
that commercial vessels have absolutely no role in looking out for Australia"
and that Ellison will "rely on reports to our hotline and go out and inspect
vessels".

Later, Senator Kerry O'Brien (Labor,
Tasmania) criticised the Government's implementation of coastal defense,
and highlighted the dangers of ignoring the ship for seventeen days, saying
that "it posed and possibly still poses unknown environmental and quarantine
risks" and that the Jian Seng "has been refused admission to Weipa
harbour...It could have been carrying literally anything. It could have been
carrying chemicals. It could have been carrying guns".

Senator David Johnston (Liberal,
Western Australia) went on to debate that there are no shipping lanes in
the area where the Jian Seng was found, and that devoting resources to a
harmless ship would leave gaps in the coastal defenses elsewhere.
