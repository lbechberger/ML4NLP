Ontario Provincial Police raided a farmhouse on Sunday, continuing an investigation into what is called Ontario's "biggest massacre".

On Saturday, eight bodies were found in or around vehicles near the village of Shedden, approximately 30 kilometres from London, Ontario. Police would not identify the victims, but believed they knew each other and were from the Toronto area. They also refused to comment on any possible links between the deaths and organised crime.

Neighbours believed the house was owned by a former leader of a motorcycle gang. Police have closed off a 15 square kilometre area while they search for clues. They would not comment on the reason for the raid.
