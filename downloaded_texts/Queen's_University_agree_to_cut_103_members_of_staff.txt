Queen’s University of Belfast, Northern Ireland has agreed to cut 103 members of staff and to close its German department. The ruling body agreed with the cuts claiming that it would save money and also increase the school's chances of entering the world’s top 100 universities. 

Originally announced as a staffing reduction of 150 positions, the number was lowered. The lecturers' union has commented, saying it is the "wrong decision"; they intend to “fight the job losses” despite the fact that the number is lower than expected. 

According to the BBC, the university wishes to ensure that most of the academic staff takes part in "high quality" research, so those who just teach students are most at risk of losing their jobs. 

Both the university management, and the union are to appear before the Employment and Learning Committee of the Northern Ireland Assembly at a later date. They were summoned after reports of job and subject cuts.
