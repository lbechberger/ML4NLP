Oliver Knezovic, who is suspected of killing a Bosnia and Herzegovinan football club fan in the southwest town of Siroki Brijeg, has escaped from the custody of judicial police, local media reported on Tuesday.

Police have launched an investigation and the officers responsible for Knezovic have been suspended. Media reports suggest he fled to Croatia.

The president of the Supreme Court of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Amir Jagnjac, said that Knezovic escaped at around midnight on Tuesday from the custody of police. He said that the officers who were on duty when Knezovic made his escape have been suspended.

Sarajevo resident Vedran Puljic, aged 24, was killed by a gunshot on Sunday in clashes that broke out as soon as fans of the Sarajevo team arrived in Siroki Brijeg to watch the game against the local football squad.
