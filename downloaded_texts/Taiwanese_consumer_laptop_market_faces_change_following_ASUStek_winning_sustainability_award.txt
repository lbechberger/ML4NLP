ASUS Eee PC, earlier launched world-wide for cost-saving and functionality factors, became a hot topic in 2007 Taipei IT Month. But the consumer market on laptop computer will be radically varied and changed after ASUS was awarded in the 2007 Taiwan Sustainable Award by Executive Yuan of the Republic of China.

Chairman of ASUS Jonney Shih said: "With this award, we [ASUS] are progressively approved by consumers with our quality and service," and stressed: "We'll have a great opportunity to look on bright factor on the Ratio of Sale on Eee PC world-wide including Taiwan."

Recently in fact, several laptop manufacturers launched multiple laptops not only low-price laptops but also others with Intel Centrino Duo or AMD Athlon 64x2 inside for different consuming population. And those manufacturers battled also on the high-definition AV market with theirs launch. No matter what their market battle will transform, the consumer will be the survivor and winner at this battle.
