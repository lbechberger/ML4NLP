"An earthquake struck Ottawa, Canada at approximately 8:45 p.m. Eastern Standard Time on February 24, 2006." said one area resident. Natural Resources Canada, however, says the earthquake of 4.5 magnitude struck Western Quebec on February 25 at approximately 1:39 UTC (Coordinated Universal Time) which is effectively GMT (Greenwich Mean Time). (Earthquakes are generally listed in UTC time to ensure an absolute and consistent basis of when they occurred.) This may have been felt several hundred kilometres away.
