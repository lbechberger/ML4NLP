Former Massachusetts governor and presidential hopeful Mitt Romney, 60, has announced his intentions to "suspend" his presidential bid. Romney spent millions of his own money during the campaign.

"If I fight on in my campaign, all the way to the convention, I would forestall the launch of a national campaign and make it more likely that Senator Clinton or Obama would win," Romney said during his speech when he announced he would be abandoning his campaign. "And in this time of war, I simply cannot let my campaign, be a part of aiding a surrender to terror."

With Romney's departure, most say that the Republican Party will nominate Senator John McCain at the 2008 Republican National Convention in St. Paul, Minnesota. McCain currently leads in delegate count. There is also speculation that McCain will pick Mike Huckabee, who remains in the race, as his running mate.
