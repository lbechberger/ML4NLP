At least six people died in a raid lead by Iraqi forces assisted by US troops near the Iraqi city of Fallujah Wednesday.

US Army spokesman Major Rob Philips says the troops went into an al-Qaeda hideout. Insurgents shot at the troops and they returned fire, killing six. Philips says the forces were searching for a top al-Qaeda official.

Reports from Fallujah police say seven people died and the raid was illegal and troops targeted civilians. They say there is high tension in Iraq's Anbar province over the government's military actions.

The raids comes after US president Barack Obama withdrew combat forces from Iraq, leaving 50,000 behind to aid Iraqis, two weeks ago.
