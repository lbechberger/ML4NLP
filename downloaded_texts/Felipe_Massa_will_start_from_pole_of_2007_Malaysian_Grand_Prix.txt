Ferrari driver Felipe Massa won the pole on the FIA Formula-1 2007 Malaysian Grand Prix on Sepang International Circuit. This occurred at the last possible moment. McLaren-Mercedes driver Fernando Alonso stayed in the lead for the most part of the third qualifying session, but was closely pursued by his rivals from Ferrari and by his teammate Lewis Hamilton who, after the fantastic debut in the previous race, surely has ambitions for the World Champion title.

A new interesting feature of the F1 cars was presented by Bridgestone, the tyre supplier. All tyres of softer compound will be marked by a white stria along the tyre groove starting from this race onwards. As intended, this will help audience to distinguish the tyres, it will be more helpful than the previous white heavy dot on the outer side of the tyre.
