The £16 billion Crossrail Scheme, that will run through London, Berkshire and Essex was given the go ahead; construction will begin by 2010 and it is expected to be finished by 2017. The line, that will provide 24-hour trains to the centre of London from the east and the west, will provide a better rail link to the West End.

UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown said "It was a great day for London, Crossrail and the economy" with the project expected to add £20 billion a year to the UK economy.

The government is providing a third of the money with the rest made up from borrowing against future fares and a levy on London business rates.

The news was also welcomed from the railway union RMT, who had been protesting to the government to go further for a new north to south high speed rail link.

Crossrail is also hoped to reduce the overcrowding to airports such as Heathrow and many others.
