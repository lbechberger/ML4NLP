Dark Floors, a horror film under production in Northern Finland and starring the hard rock band Lordi (who are famed for their monster costumes and lyrical themes), has received €300,000 (£200,000) funding from the Finnish government.

Lordi are also famed for their record-breaking 292 point victory in the Eurovision Song Contest 2006 with their song Hard Rock Hallelujah. It was also the first time a hard rock song had won the contest, and Finland's first ever victory.

The film is being shot in English, with a largely Finnish cast, and has a production cost of €4.2 million (£2.84 million). The plot features a "monster attack" on the world, with a young Autistic girl being the only person in a position to save it.

Lead singer Mr Lordi said that as their masks and costumes were derived from horror films it was "kind of natural" that they should make their own.
