Rob Broudie, one of Liverpool's best known lawyers and brother of Lightning Seeds singer Ian Broudie was found dead early on the morning of the 17th October after apparently jumping from the Tower of Liverpool Cathedral. An inquest is expect later in the week.

Mr. Broudie was a staunch critic of the Police and a slightly controversial figure, having once been charged with affray after fighting with another of Liverpool's lawyers whilst in the cells.

His company, R.M Broudie &amp; Co, is now based on Dale Street in city centre Liverpool.
