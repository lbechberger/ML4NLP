Dragan Paskaš, the president of the Generalštab, the main governing body of the Military of Serbia and Montenegro, announced that mandatory military service may get shorthened to six months.

So far, every capable male citizen had to serve for nine months in military, or thirteen months in civil service. "I think that mandatory service should last for six months, which would eliminate barriers caused by its length, and we could start new military programs," Paskaš said. 

Military of Serbia and Montenegro has been under a lot of pressure lately, as the government froze Defense Ministry's fundings, and the military has been unable to sell buildings in downtown Belgrade attractive location, which were heavily damaged during NATO bombing in 1999.
