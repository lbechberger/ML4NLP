As the Canadian Forces were assuring the nation that they felt the Taliban incapable of launching a spring offensive, and talked of launching a new strike against insurgent forces in Afghanistan, a convoy of Canadian Coyotes and Nyalas was ambushed in Kandahar, Afghanistan. 
 
Two separate RPG attacks were made by the Taliban as the Canadians held to their route. The second attack came when vehicles damaged during the first barrage broke down and presented an easy target for the Taliban fighters. 
 
No Canadians were killed in the attacks, or in the small-arms skirmish that followed, but an Afghan civilian was shot by Canadian troops when he reportedly ignored warnings and approached the Canadians. An Afghan police officer was also killed during the firefight.
