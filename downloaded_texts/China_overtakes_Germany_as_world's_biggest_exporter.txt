Chinese officials have said that their country's exports surged last December to edge out Germany as the world's biggest exporter.

The official Xinhua news agency reported today that figures from the General Administration for Customs showed that exports jumped 17.7% in December from a year earlier. Over the whole of 2009 total Chinese exports reached US$1.2 trillion, above Germany's forecast $1.17 trillion. 

Huang Guohua, a statistics official with the customs administration, said the December exports rebound was an important turning point for China's export sector. He commented that the jump was an indication that exporters have emerged from their downslide.

"We can say that China's export enterprises have completely emerged from their all-time low in exports," he said.

However, although China overtook Germany in exports, China's total foreign trade -- both exports and imports -- fell 13.9% last year.
