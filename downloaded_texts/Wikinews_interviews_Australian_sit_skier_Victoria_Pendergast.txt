Yesterday, Wikinews spent time with with Australian Paralympic skier Victoria Pendergast who was in Copper Mountain, Colorado for this week's IPC Nor-Am Cup.

  I'm interviewing Victoria Pendergast who is an Australian female sit skier on the development team.
::Victoria Pendergast: Yer, that's right.
  How have you been doing here [Copper Mountain] so far?
::Victoria Pendergast: Yer, its been alright. Like some races not so good, other races I was pretty happy with the results. We've got Winter Park to look forward to, so bit of a warm-up, but, trying to get results.
  Before this [skiing] the other sport you've done is athletics? You competed at that for the games or was that somebody else?
::Victoria Pendergast: No, that was me. I did it for the school, did shot put and did swimming for a bit.
  Why would someone switch from athletics to be a crazy mono skier?
::Victoria Pendergast: It was a bit of a crazy sort of events kinda went here with my family and then one thing lead to another and like wanted to give sit skiing a go.
  Australia doesn't have many female sit skiers, are you shooting for Sochi?
::Victoria Pendergast: It would be nice to get it. It'd be a bit hard to get points to get into it but, you know, if I can get the points to get into Sochi, I've got some [...]. 
  Cool. Thank you very much.
