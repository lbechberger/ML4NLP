Clint Brown, sports presenter for 3 News on TV3 in New Zealand has resigned amid the allegations that he had verbally attacked a taxi driver which resulted in him being admitted to hospital with a concussion and a broken eye socket.

TV3 has confirmed that they have accepted the resignation of Brown.
 
Rick Friesen, Chief Operating Officer of the TV Works division of CanWest MediaWorks NZ, that runs TV3, said: "We wish to acknowledge Clint's significant skills as a sports broadcaster, and thank him for his 17 years of very loyal service to TV3. Clint Brown is a passionate New Zealand sports fan, and he has been at the forefront of some of New Zealand's biggest sporting moments."
 
Brown said: "The last month or so has been enormously stressful for me and my family. I am pleased that the investigation into my violent assault has clarified what was and was not said. As a family we have decided that it is now time for a change. All that is left to say is thanks to TV3 for 17 great years and to the loyal viewers over that time."

Friesen said the TV3 does not believe that Brown uttered the remarks attributed to him.
 
"We will celebrate Clint's 17 years of service to TV3 with an appropriate send off," Friesen said.

TV3 has said that they wish Brown well in his future endeavours.
