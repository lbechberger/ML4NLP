Turner Prize winning artist, Wolfgang Tilmans has donated an image to Quaker Social Action which has been used for their first ever greeting cards.

Wolfgang said,

"Being an occasional attender and in the process of learning more about Friends, I've been impressed with the Quaker tradition of putting one's beliefs into action. Groups like Quaker Social Action are living testimony to that practice. There is a direct connection between spiritual and social activity, that serves us as a constant reminder to live in the Here and Now. Not all of us are able or willing to commit time to social issues, others can or want to commit only money or support; both are essential to those helping and to those in need. 
That's why I decided to support QSA."

Judith Moran, QSA Director followed, "We are extremely grateful to Wolfgang, not only for donating the image but for his support in producing the card, we think it looks wonderful!"
