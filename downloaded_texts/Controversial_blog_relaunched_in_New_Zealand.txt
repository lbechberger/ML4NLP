A controversial blog that posts personal details about many workers at New Zealand's Child, Youth and Family Services (CYFS) has been relaunched after Google's Blogger removed the site due to a death threat.

The controversial blog, named CYFSWATCH NEW ZEALAND posts personal stories about how CYFS workers have treated them and their family, and then posts personal details about those workers. It also is targeting the chief executive of the Ministry of Social Development. The recent relaunch sees 127 more CYFS workers' personal details being posted on the online blog.

The site is now hosted by a Masterton, New Zealand man known as, "Kiwi 1960", Wikinews suggests that the man's first name is Peter. Russell Brown, media commentator, found out that "Kiwi 1960" was hosting the new site. 

"Kiwi 1960" could be charged with criminal offences, but says that he is not worried about it, stating that he is a "victim" of CYFS. However Ursula Cheer, associate professor at Canterbury University said that although the content could be described as defamatory, no criminal charges are likely as there is nothing stopping anyone from setting up Internet sites.

The death threat posted online that led to Blogger removing the blog, was aimed at being the first political assassination in New Zealand. It was made against Sue Bradford because of her publicly unsupported bill that would make smacking, or correcting, a child illegal.

Ms Bradford says that she is disappointed that the blog is now running again.
