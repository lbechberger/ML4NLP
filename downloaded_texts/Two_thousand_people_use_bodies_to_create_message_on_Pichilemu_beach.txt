More than two thousand people assembled at the Las Terrazas beach in Pichilemu to create the message "Viva Chile: Bicentenario Cardenal Caro" (English: "Viva Chile: Bicentennial [in] Cardenal Caro") using their bodies.

Julio Ibarra, the governor of Cardenal Caro, organized the event in two days, gathering people from schools, neighborhood councils, Huasos clubs, surfers, and policemen.

People started to arrive at the beach at around 10:00 AM local time (1400 UTC). Ibarra said to Radio Universidad de Chile that "the objective of the activity was to create a post that will be distributed all around the world."

Pichileminian Huasos created the sentence "Viva Chile," and other schools created letters of "Bicentenario" and "Cardenal Caro." Graciela Vargas UrzÃºa, teacher from Colegio Preciosa Sangre, said that "it was a beautiful experience that [she] had never seen before in Pichilemu."

The pictures were taken by photographer Philip Muller, in an Army helicopter.
