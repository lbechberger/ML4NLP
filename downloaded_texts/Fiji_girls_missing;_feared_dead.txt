Three teen-aged sisters went missing on Sunday, June 26th, and Fijian police have called in navy divers to aid in the search.

Ashika Sherin Lata, 19, Renuka Roshni Lata, 18 and Radhika Roshni Lata, 17 were taken on a boat trip to Malake island near Viti Levu by a family friend. The friend "was found alone in the boat and then he informed the family that he was assaulted by three Fijians", Constable Prashila Narayan told Radio New Zealand International.

Divisional Crime Officer Vijay Singh reported additional officers have been called in on the case, but told Fijilive that the navy divers were necessary for the case.

"Until [the navy divers come in] we are just searching around the island where they disappeared and hopefully try and get clues as to which direction they may have been heading."
