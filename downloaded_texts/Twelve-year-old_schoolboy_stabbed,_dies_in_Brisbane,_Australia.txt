A twelve-year-old pupil at a private all boy's school on Brisbane's north side has died in the Royal Children's Hospital this morning after being stabbed in the chest with a knife by a thirteen-year-old fellow student.

St Patrick's College, a Catholic school with around 1,100 students, by The Christian Brothers in the bayside suburb of Shorncliffe, Queensland, went into lockdown at around 8.15am AEST for three hours; they have since assured parents their sons are safe to remain at the school until the usual time. In a prepared statement the school headmaster, Dr Michael Carroll, said, "I have informed students and staff of this tragedy and counselling services are available to all students and staff. While I'm unable to discuss the details of how the injury was sustained, I can confirm that it did involve another student from the college and that other student is now assisting police with their inquiries."

The accused student was found near the school with a minor self-inflicted neck wound. There were no other people injured. Subsequent reports indicate he has been charged with murder.
