Emails allegedly hacked from Syrian government accounts, leaked onto the Internet, indicate Iran and Syria are supplying weapons made in Ukraine and Belarus to Hamas in Palestine.


The online activist group known as Anonymous takes responsibility for the leak, which comprises over 2,000 emails and other files totaling around 1 gigabyte. The leak is part of Anonymous' ongoing campaign known as '#OpSyria' or 'Operation Syria' on the social networking website Twitter. 

On Monday at 2030 Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), 'Par:AnoIA,' one of many Twitter accounts connected to Anonymous, stated that the group would "release a stash of Syrian Government emails in the next 24h, featuring Kofi Annan correspondence, cash &amp; weapon deliveries." Three hours later the same user announced a leak of "1 Gigabyte [of] internal emails from [the] Syrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs" onto the internet. 

The first email leaked was called a "teaser", from the Syrian embassy in Tehran on November 20, to the British embassy in Belarus. In the communique, the embassy confirms the Iranians are supplying helicopters and Ukrainian made weapons to Hamas, which operates mostly from the Gaza Strip in Palestine. "1.2D projectiles of Ukraine origin found in Egypt and Syria" are some of the weapons being sent to Palestine along with "EC725 Helicopters". 

"Since 2008 Iran is the main transit point for Palestine armament", says the email. It also goes on to say the weapons are made in Ukraine as part of "2008 arms trade operations sanctioned by The [Ukrainian] Minister of Defense Anatoly Gritsenko.

This is not the first time Anonymous has hacked into Syrian government email accounts. In February, the group hacked into 78 Syrian government email accounts and leaked the usernames and passwords associated with them. The accounts accessed reportedly belonged to aides of Syrian president Bashar al-Assad. One of the leaked emails, allegedly written by a press aide at Syria's mission at the UN in New York named Sheherazad Jaafari, talks about Assad's preparation for a December 2011 television interview with ABC News' Barbara Walters. In it, Jaafari wrote about ways the Syrian president might be able to manipulate the television audience. 

"The American audience doesn't really care about reforms. They won't understand it and they are not interested to do so.... American Psyche can be easily manipulated when they hear that there are 'mistakes' done and now we are 'ï¬�xing it.' ... Its worth mentioning also what is happening now in Wall Street [Occupy Wall Street] and the way the demonstrations are been suppressed by police men, police dogs and beatings," wrote Jaafari.
