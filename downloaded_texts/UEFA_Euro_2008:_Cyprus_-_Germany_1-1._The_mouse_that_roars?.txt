Unfavoured Cyprus held mighty Germany to 1-1 draw in Nicosia’s new GSP stadium on the 15th of November.

 Michael Ballack of Chelsea FC gave Germany the lead in the 16th minute and it appeared that the Germans were on their way to a fourth consecutive victory in Group D. But Yiannakis Okkas of Olympiakos Piraeus leveled the game on the stroke of half time driving a long-range volley past German keeper Timo Hildebrand.

Despite several chances for both teams the game ended in a draw leaving the 3 times world champions disappointed and the home fans celebrating one of their proudest results to date.

This result follows Cyprus’ 5-2 thumping of Ireland in their previous home game.
