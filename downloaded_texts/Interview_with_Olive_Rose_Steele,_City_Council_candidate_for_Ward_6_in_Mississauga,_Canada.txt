The upcoming 2006 Mississauga municipal election, to be held November 13, features an array of candidates looking to represent their wards in city council.

Wikinews contributor Nicholas Moreau has contacted as many candidates as possible, including Olive Rose Steele, asking them to answer common questions sent in an email. There is no incumbent in the ward; also competing for the position are Matanat Khan, Sean Semper-Whyte, Terry Pierce, Jr., Ron Starr, and former MP Carolyn Parrish.
