Wellington City has dropped the speed limit of some of its streets to 30 km/h from June 6. The speed limit was changed after a student was killed in a bus lane, Willis Street.

Wellington Coroner Garry Evans suggested the changes.

Lambton Quay, central Wellington, is one of the routes affected.

"104 crashes have been reported in the past five years in the Lambton Quay area - a third of which involved pedestrians. The council hopes to reduce the number and severity of accidents. The lower speed is more appropriate for the area and better reflects the speed many drivers already travel at," says Deputy Mayor Alick Shaw. 

The mother of the student killed, Brenda Bongiovanni, said that she is relieved to hear the changes.

The new speed limit will apply from Lower Willis St to the Lambton interchange &amp; bus terminal adjacent to the Central Railway Station, and Mercer St and Bunny St, the distance is 1.3 km.
