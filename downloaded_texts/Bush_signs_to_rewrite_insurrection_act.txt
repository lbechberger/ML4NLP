During the night of October 27, President George W. Bush has signed a bill into law that changes the Insurrection Act (10 U.S.C.331 -335). Public Law 109-364 allows the president to declare a state of emergency anywhere at any time and move United States troops to suppress any public disorder. It also allows the president to take control of any state troops, forces, or national guard.
