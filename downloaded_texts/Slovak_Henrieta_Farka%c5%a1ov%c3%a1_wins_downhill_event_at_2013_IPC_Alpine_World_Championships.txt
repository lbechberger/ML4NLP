This morning in La Molina, Spain, Slovak B3 classified skier Henrieta Farkašová and guide Natália Šubrtová won the IPC Alpine World Championships's women's visually impaired downhill event.

The field in the women's event was not as deep as the men's vision impaired, with only four visually impaired skiers competing. Russian B2 classified skier Alexandra Frantseva and guide Pavel Zabotini finished in second. B3 classified British skier Kelly Gallagher and guide Charlotte Evans finished in third place. United States B2 classified skier Danelle Umstead and guide Robert Umstead finished just off the podium in fourth place.

The women's visually impaired skiers are next scheduled to compete on Friday in the Super-G event, with a start time of approximately 9:30 local time, 8:30 UTC. Farkašová then tries to get her second gold, out of the five she targets at these Championships.
