Maryland State Police have issued an AMBER alert for two teenaged boys who were reportedly abducted in a 2004 black BMW 645 with Maryland temporary tags. According to the Baltimore Sun, the vehicle was later found, but the victims are still missing.

Police say that at 3 a.m. EDT (UTC-4), early Tuesday morning, six armed men wearing masks forced their way into the two-story house. They bound and gagged the residents and when they left at around 11 a.m. they took the two brothers with them.

A relative of the boys witnessed them being led from the house to the BMW car. He began to approach but, according to police, the assailants fired a shot at him and drove away.

Baltimore County police spokesperson, Mike Hill, said that the remaining victims in the house initially refused to give information, though they later gave some information. He said it was not known if any property was stolen from the house.

The boys have been identified as Stephon and Sterling Blackwell. Stephon is described as five feet seven inches and 145 pounds and last seen wearing blue jeans and a gray sweatshirt. Sterling is said to be five feet four inches tall and 150 pounds. He was last seen wearing blue jeans and green hoodie sweatshirt

The police are requesting anybody with information that may help in locating the victims to call (410) 307-2020 or 911. The vehicle tags are Maryland 04350D.
