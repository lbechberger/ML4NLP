A brief look around major league baseball. . . 

Philadelphia 8, Tampa Bay 5

The Philadelphia Phillies snapped a five game losing streak, defeating Tampa Bay 8-5 between a Father's Day crowd of 42,658 earlier today at Citizens' Bank Park in Philadelphia. Phillies first baseman Ryan Howard homered and knocked in four runs, and Phils' closer Tom Gordon, in a game for the first time in over a week, pitched 1 2/3 shaky innings for his 19th save. The Phillies are 15-5 in games in which Howard hits the long ball. Tampa OF Carl Crawford was 2 for 5 with a homer and 2 RBI for the losing Rays.

With the Phillies getting farther away from the Mets in the NL East, the Phils are likely to start concentrating on the NL wild card race if not now, very soon.

Washington 3, N.Y. Yankees 2

Further south, Washington Nationals' third baseman Ryan Zimmerman hit a walk off 2 run shot in the bottom of the 9th to lift Washington over the visiting New York Yankees, 3-2. Zimmerman, whose hitting has gotten hotter with the temperatures, hit the game winner off of Yankees losing pitcher Chien - Ming Wang spoiling his major league debut
