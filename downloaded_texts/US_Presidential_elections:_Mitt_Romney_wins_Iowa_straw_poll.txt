Massachusetts Governor and Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney won a recent straw poll in Iowa, gaining 31.6 percent of the votes, with Mike Huckabee following with 18.1 percent.

John Cox finished the Republican straw poll in last place, ending with less than 0.5 percent of the vote.

Over 14,000 valid ballots were cast in the straw poll, which was conducted by the Iowa Republican Party. 

Earlier, a malfunctioning voting machine used in the Iowa straw poll forced at least 1,500 ballots to be counted by hand.
