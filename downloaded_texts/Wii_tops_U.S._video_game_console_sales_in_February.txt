NDP Group released the independent February United States video game sale reports today leaving gaming companies with things to both worry, and jump for joy about. Nintendo had a strong lead last month with the DS and Wii at the top of the list at 485,000 and 335,000 units sold, respectively. Nintendo alone sold 54% of industry wide merchandise.

Microsoft beat out Nintendo for best-selling game of the month with its Xbox 360 exclusive game, Crackdown. Nintendo filled the other 3 spots in the top 4 with Wii Play with Wiimote at number 2, Diddy Kong Racing at number 3, and The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess coming in 4th.

Sony only made one spot on the top 10 best-selling games list for February with Guitar Hero 2 bundle coming in 5th overall.

The president of the American Nintendo, Reggie Fils-Aime said, "We're gratified that the explosive appeal of Wii, in terms of both new players and new ways to play, has created unprecedented demand, substantially beyond supply."
