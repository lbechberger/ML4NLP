With three full competitions complete as of this morning at the 2013 IPC Alpine World Championships in La Molina, Spain, Great Britain's women skiers have delivered all three of the nation's medals.

In the women's visually impaired downhill, Kelly Gallagher and guide Charlotte Evans earned a bronze medal on the first day of competition. Gallagher and Evans were the only members of Team GB to compete in the downhill event. Gallagher and Evans earned a silver on the second day of competition in the Super-G event, with Jade Etherington and guide John Clark earning a bronze medal in the same group.

In yesterday's slalom event, no one on Team GB made the podium: Etherington and Clark finished fourth in the women's visually impaired group. Gallagher, women's LW12 classified sit skier Anna Turney, and men's LW12 classified sit skier Michael Brennan each earned a Did Not Finish (DNF) in the same event on their first runs. Men's LW5/7-3 classified standing skier James Whitley and men's LW12-1 classified sit-skier Timothy Farr earned DNFs on their second runs.

In the Super-G event, Turney and Brennan also each earned a DNF.

Farr, Turney, and Gallagher were all members of Team GB at the 2010 Winter Paralympics in Vancouver. The 2013 IPC Alpine World Championships is scheduled to continue today with the Super Combined event.
