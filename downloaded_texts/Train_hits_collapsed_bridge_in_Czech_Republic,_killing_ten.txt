An express train struck a collapsed motorway bridge in the Czech Republic, leaving 7 people dead and 64 injured. The EuroCity train, which was en route from Kraków, Poland to Prague, derailed after it collided while traveling at 134km/h (84mph).

According to Czech Railways spokesman Radek Joklik, "it probably hit part of a motorway bridge under construction which fell onto the track." It is believed that the bridge, which is near Studénka, may have fallen onto the train, crushing carriages below it.

The train, which was carrying 400 people, saw a derailment of its locomotive and first three passenger carriages.

Rescue operations are underway, with 16 fire brigades and 30 vehicles at the scene, which is 215 miles from Prague and close to the Polish border. Numerous ambulances and several helicopters are transporting the wounded to hospital.

Many of the passengers were traveling to a music festival in Pardubice. The toll of dead and injured could rise further as investigators release information.
