A 17-year veteran of the Laval, Quebec police force
was shot dead and another injured during a drug raid in Brossard, Quebec.

Constable Daniel Tessier was shot in the head and was pronounced dead on arrival at hospital. 

The second officer, Constable Stephane Forbes, was shot in the shoulder and is reported to be in stable condition. 

The officers were taking part in concurrent drug raids in the Montreal area, which involved as many as 30 officers at 8 locations.

The wounded officers were shot while taking part in a 5 a.m. raid at a Brossard home. Tessier and Forbes were shot after entering the house with 4 other officers. A woman was injured during the skirmish, according to Constable Marc Butz of the Surete du Quebec, the provincial force who have taken over the investigation. Two suspects were arrested at the scene.

The coordinated police raids were the follow-up to investigations into cocaine drug rings, according to Jean-Pierre Gariepy, a Laval Police spokesman.

The funeral for Tessier, when it takes place, will be attended by fellow police officers from across the country.
