The Swiss yachting team, Alinghi, have defeated Team New Zealand in the fifth race for the 32nd America's Cup. The overall score is now 3-2 to Alinghi.

Alinghi won the race by 19 seconds, though throughout the pre-start race each yacht was within close distance of each other. Team New Zealand, racing with NZL-92, crossed the start line first and reached a 12 second lead at the first mark. But when Team New Zealand were preparing to fly a new kite, their spinnaker ripped in two and went flying into the air. Their second spinnaker was not tied on properly and the third one got tangled half way up.

Team New Zealand managed to free the first two and untangle the third to continue the race, making up some of the 140 metres Alinghi had created in the three minute hold up.

Grant Dalton, managing director of Team New Zealand, said, "That was an important race and it wasn't one we should have lost on a mistake on a move we've practised time and again."

The team first to five wins, wins the "Auld Mug".
