Today, a dust storm struck the Japanese capital city of Tokyo, covering it in a plume of brown dust and blocking out the sunlight.

A spokesperson for the Japan Meteorological Agency said, "A rapidly developing low pressure system in the north was moving down south. It was bringing a snow storm in the north, and strong winds in Tokyo and surrounding areas".
