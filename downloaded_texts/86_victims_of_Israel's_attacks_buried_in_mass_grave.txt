Because the morgue in south Lebanon's city Tyre is full of dead people killed by indirect fire, 86 victims, more than half children, were buried in a mass grave near the hospital. Since there are only few people left in Tyre and the dead often consist whole families, only twenty people were present at the funeral.

Three victims have still not been identified. DNA samples were extracted, in hopes of identifying them.
