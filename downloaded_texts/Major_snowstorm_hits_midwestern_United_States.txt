A major winter storm is dropping snow, ice, and freezing rain across the Midwestern United States. 

Over 12 inches (30cm) of snow is expected in parts of Ohio and Indiana. Along the Ohio River, freezing rain and sleet is expected to make driving hazardous. The precipitation is forecast to continue through the evening Tuesday and into early Wednesday morning, before moving out towards the East Coast.

Blizzard warnings have been issued for much of Northwest Ohio and Northern Indiana, with very cold temperatures, considerable snowfall, and blowing and drifting snow.

Many flights have been canceled or delayed at Port Columbus International Airport, especially those destined for other cities in the midwest. 

Schools have been canceled, and some businesses are sending employees home early. The Ohio State University, University of Cincinnati and many other colleges decided to cancel classes, sending home all non-essential staff.
