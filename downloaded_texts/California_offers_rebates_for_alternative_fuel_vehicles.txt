California, the most populous state in the United States, is offering rebates of up to US$5000 to residents who purchase alternative fuel vehicles. $1.62 million in rebates are scheduled to be granted statewide by California Center for Sustainable Energy, an independent nonprofit organization based in San Diego.

Owners of Vectrix electric motorcycles may qualify for up to $1,500 and Global Electric Motorcars owners may receive $950 and $1,300. The largest rebates will go to owners of full-sized zero-emission cars, which have not yet been approved by the state. Compressed-gas vehicles also qualify, but the agency has already awarded its budgeted allotment for this type of vehicle. 

The eligible period for purchases and leases is May 24, 2007 to March 31, 2009. Applications will be accepted on a first come, first served basis. A complete list of qualifying vehicles can be seen at the California Center for Sustainable Energy's website.

The program is part of $25 million authorized in 2007 by California Assembly Bill 1811 to promote alternative fuel infrastructure and vehicles. According to the California Air Resources Board, about 25,000 dedicated alternative fuel vehicles are in use in California.
