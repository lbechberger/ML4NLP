76 businesses in Bristol, United Kingdom have been given zero stars out of a possible five, for food hygiene, by the food department of Bristol City Council. This is considerably higher than the number of 0 star ratings awarded by neighboring councils. The scores, which are collected by inspectors from the council, are displayed on a website funded by the UK government.

Restaurants including Spice Out Tandoori on Wellington Hill West and Taste of India in the largely up-market area of Clifton have been presented with a zero star rating, in addition to restaurants like the Family Kebab House in Fishponds.

The owners of one of the restaurants on the list defended his restaurant. He said "we [workers at the restaurant] were visited before Christmas and have done what we had to do, which was to put up a new shelf and do some minor cleaning." 

Customers of these businesses have told Wikinews that they are unconcerned by the changes. One, a customer of the Spice Out Tandoori, told Wikinews that they "have no issues with the food" and that they "will continue to get my [the customer's] food here." 

Some businesses were however, awarded with a five star award. One of these was Waitrose on Northumbria Drive, Henleaze. A customer there told Wikinews that it is "reassuring" to find out the shop received a five star award for food hygiene.
