Multiple car bombs in Iraq's capital of Baghdad have killed at least 58 and wounded a further hundred. Some media reports put the death toll as high as 69.

Most of the explosions took place near Shia mosques during prayers; the deadliest attacks, meanwhile, were in Sadr City. There were at least six total bombings, although some reports put the figure as high as thirteen.

Baghdad security spokesman Qassim Moussawi told Reuters news agency the bombings targeted "prayers in areas with a certain majority", referring to Iraq's Shia population.

A top official accused al-Qaeda as being responsible for the attacks. Meanwhile, Qassim Moussawi, a security spokesman in the capital, said to Reuters that the blasts were "revenge for the losses suffered by al-Qaeda", adding that he believed "such terrorist acts" will continue.
