A virtual orchestra opened in London on August 19th 2006 outside the Royal Festival Hall on London's South Bank. But unlike a normal orchestra, this one features 58 specially designed cube-shaped seats which activate a musicical note. As more people sit down on the seats, more of the score is revealed. 

The music will be added to an online sample library. Jude Kelly, Artistic Director of South Bank Centre, said: "This is exactly the way we are looking at developing our site by fusing the community with the artistic world of ideas and technology in our many versatile spaces." 

Alistair Mackie, chairman of the Philharmonia Orchestra, said: "Central to the Philharmonia Orchestra's vision is exploiting new media to take music out to the widest possible audience, breaking down the barriers which have stood in the way of their access and enjoyment." 

Bethany, aged 10, went to the orchestra launch and she said: "It is a good experience. You get to see what it's like to be in a real orchestra." One of the main aims of the virtual orchestra is to get more people interested in classical music.

Every Saturday, a musician from the Philharmonic Orchestra will be visiting and they will bring their sound recording equipment.
