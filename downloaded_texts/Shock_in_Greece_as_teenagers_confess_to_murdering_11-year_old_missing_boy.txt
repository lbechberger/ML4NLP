Alex Meschisvili, 11, was missing from his home in Veria, northern Greece, since February 3, 2006. Five months later, Greek public opinion is numbed as the developments of the missing child case bring five children, aged from 11 to 13, to admit that they killed Alex after a fight. According to the Police directorate of Imathia, the alleged murderers are two Greek brothers, one Romanian and two Albanian boys.

The juveniles allegedly confessed to the act and have indicated the place where they buried the body in the center of Veria, at an abandoned house just behind the Municipal building. 

While the search for the finding of Alex' body continues, the local Police bureau in collaboration with the Thessaloniki Police department continue their own investigation, based on all the information available since the disappearance of the 11-years old boy, reviewing all scenarios and any relevant information. 

If there is confirmation of Alex Meschisvili's murder by the alleged juveniles, it will be the first known case of a teenager's murder by teenagers in the crime history of Greece.
