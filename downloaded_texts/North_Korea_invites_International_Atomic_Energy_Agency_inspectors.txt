North Korea has invited the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to send inspectors to Pyongyang for the purpose of discussing the shut-down of the country's nuclear reactor.

The announcement comes on the heels of news that US$25 million had been released to North Korea from a Macau bank. The IAEA inspectors are part of a deal worked out in the six-party talks.

"I talked to IAEA today and I know there is going to be contact ... with DPRK representatives as early as today, so they may be able to tell us pretty soon when they will be able to get to Pyongyang," said Christopher R. Hill, assistant U.S. secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific Affairs.
