On Monday the electoral council of Haiti decided to move back the presidential elections, slated to take place on November 6th, to a new date of November 20th. The first round will take place on that date and the second round of voting will take place on January 3.

Also the council announces that the previously moved municipal elections will take place on December 11th. Before it was only known that they had been moved to December. The postponement come off of concerns of security and registration problems.
