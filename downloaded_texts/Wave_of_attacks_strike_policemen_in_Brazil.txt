PCC (Primeiro Comando da Capital, Portuguese for First Command of the Capital City) criminals have been backing several attacks against security forces in the state of São Paulo, Brazil. Since Friday, there have been 81 deaths: 22 military and 6 civil policemen, 8 prison personnel, 3 city guards and 4 civilians have been targeted. 180 attacks against personnel, police departments, busses and banks have been recorded.
 
In the meantime, there have been 53 prison riots across São Paulo, Mato Grosso do Sul and Paraná, with hostages. There is no confirmed count of wounded and dead, but early information indicates that rival faction members have killed criminals during the riots.

This has been a response to the government's decision last week to isolate the leaders of the group. Criminals have also set fire to more than forty buses and banks, but there haven't been any confirmed victims.

As a response to these incidents, the State Police of São Paulo have arrested 82 suspects. They have closed streets near police departments, and armed policemen are patrolling regions of the city.
