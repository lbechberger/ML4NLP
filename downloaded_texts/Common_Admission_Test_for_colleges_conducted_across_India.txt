Over 1,90,000 students appeared for the Common Admission Test (CAT) which was conducted in 23 cities in the country. The test is taken by those seeking admission into the six prestigious Indian Institutes of Management (IIMs) and 80 other top management institutes in India. The test began at 10:30 a.m. (IST), and the results are expected in the first week of January. 

IIM-Ahmedabad is the only institute which has already specified the minimum marks it will take for students to make the cut. There has been a 20% rise in the number of entrants over last year. Students who score over 33% in the written test will be invited to the interview and group discussion rounds of the exam. CAT-2006 also saw some changes being made to the format of the test :-
*The age limit for candidates was scrapped.
*No limit will be set on the number of attempts at the test.
*Graduates need to have at least 50% aggregate to apply.
*Students awaiting their results can sit for the CAT but would need to produce their passing certificates upon admission.
