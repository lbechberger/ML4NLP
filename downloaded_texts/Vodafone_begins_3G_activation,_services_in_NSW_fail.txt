Customers of Vodafone Australia in New South Wales, Australia have had issues with their service today as Vodafone activates its 3G network. Customers in NSW have had intermittent issues since 8:00 AM AEDT (2100 UTC). At 7:30 PM, Vodafone was yet to advise an ETA on a resolution.

Customers report a range of issues such as intermittent loss of reception, voice calls where no voice can be heard and the inability to access mobile internet and picture messaging.

Ahmed Mazloum, a spokesman for Vodafone, told Wikinews that the issues have been caused by the activation of Vodafone's 3G network.

"We have commenced switching on 3G on the network and this has caused an unforeseen issue with around ninety percent of the network in New South Wales," said Mazloum.

"We are aware customers may be frustrated with their lack of service, but they can be assured that Vodafone will be working around the clock until services are returned to normal."

In December 2007, it was revealed that Vodafone would commence a program to rollout 3G to 95% of the Australian population by December 2008. Vodafone's current 3G network is only active in capital cities and its 2G network covers 93% of the Australian population.
