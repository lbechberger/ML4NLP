The Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) has received US$25,000,000 frozen in 2005 as part of the general crackdown on the communist state.

The funds had been frozen in a Macau bank after the United States earlier alleged that the money was gained from activities including money laundering and counterfeiting. 

The DPRK had demanded return of the money as a precondition to engaging in the six-party talks. In February, the U.S. agreed to allow North Korea to retrieve their funds.
