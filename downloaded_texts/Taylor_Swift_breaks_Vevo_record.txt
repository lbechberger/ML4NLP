Taylor Swift has set a new Vevo record with her music video Bad Blood getting 20.1 million views in 24 hours this past week. The artist took the title from Nicki Minaj who had 19.6 million views for Anaconda in August 2014. 

The country-turned-pop singer premiered the video at the Billboard Music Awards where she won several awards including Top Artist and the Billboard Achievement Award.

The video featured celebrities including Mariska Hargitay, Zendaya, Cindy Crawford, Ellen Pompeo, Lily Aldridge and more. Selena Gomez portrays the antagonist. 

Victorias secret model Karlie Kloss believes the video could turn into a feature length film. 

"I think she should turn it into a movieâ€¦ premiering next year at Cannes," she said.
