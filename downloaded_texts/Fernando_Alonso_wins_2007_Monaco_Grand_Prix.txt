McLaren Mercedes drivers Fernando Alonso and Lewis Hamilton win the FIA Formula-1 2007 Monaco Grand Prix at the Circuit de Monaco in Monte Carlo from top two places of the starting grid. 

As Ferrari driver Felipe Massa said after the race his car was completely "out of pace" and was not able to compete properly. While in the first half of the race he was trying to stay close to Hamilton, in the second part the gap increased to more than 40 seconds. This was due to the traffic, Anthony Davidson from Super Aguri-Honda team even got a drive-through penalty for ignoring the waving blue flags. Massa ended up on the third place.

All the other pilots, starting from Giancarlo Fisichella from Renault lose at least one lap to the podium third.

Kimi Räikkönen, who started 16th because of his error in the second qualifying session, struggled hard and got up to the 8th place scoring one additional point to his championship standings. Scott Speed driving for Toro Rosso-Ferrari also was highly successful, the only American pilot attached himself to the rear wing of Finn and managed to get 9th from his 18th place.
