Police are still looking for the suspect that killed Denver Broncos cornerback Darrent Williams, 24, in a drive by shooting January 1. Williams was killed by a single gunshot wound to the neck.

Police say there was a disagreement at a nightclub birthday party for Kenyon Martin, a forward with the Denver Nuggets National Basketball Association team, and Williams and his two friends left. His two friends, a man and a woman, were hit along with him.

The suspect was in a white 1998 Chevrolet Tahoe. Police said earlier they where looking for a Tahoe or Suburban with dark-tinted windows.

Williams teamates honoured him at a memorial service today.

"We'll have a memorial service on Wednesday with our players and coaches and Darrent's family," Broncos coach Mike Shanahan said at a press conference on Tuesday. "I don't think he had a guy that wasn't his friend," added Shanahan. "That's the way he lived life. He always had a smile on his face."

"[Receiver Javon Walker] just went through a tragic experience," Shanahan said about one of the other injured passengers. "A lot of times when somebody has that happen to them, they wonder why it (wasn't them). That's just human nature and obviously the counselors are talking with him about that. It's a process. It takes some time."

The entire Denver Broncos will attend the funeral service for Williams on Saturday in his hometown of Fort Worth, Texas, according to Shanahan.

The investigation remains ongoing.
