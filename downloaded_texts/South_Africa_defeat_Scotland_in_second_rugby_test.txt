South Africa defeated Scotland in the second of two rugby tests between the two nations, with the Springboks also winning the test in Durban the previous week. The match was played in Port Elizabeth at the EPRU Stadium.

Percy Montgomery got the first points of the match as he kicked an early penalty goal for South Africa to put them out in front three to nil within the first couple of minutes. Montgomery kicked another penalty for South Africa in the fourth minute, taking South Africa out to an early six to nil lead, as well as taking his own international points tally to 600 points, becoming the first Springbok to do so. Scotland's Simon Webster scores the first try of the match. Although Chris Paterson misses the conversion, Scotland are now just a point behind, the score now six to five. The Springboks furthered their lead with another successful penalty kick from Montgomery in the 16th mnute, as well as Jaco van der Westhuyzen kicking another around the 25 minute mark, taking the score to 12 to five. A late try was disallowed by the television match official to Scotland's Webster, so the sides entered half-time at 12 to five.

Montgomery opened up the scoring in the second half, kicking a penalty goal five minutes in. Subsequent penalties to Scotland's Paterson, as well as another to Montgomery saw the score move to 18 to 8 with over 25 minutes remaining. South Africa score their first try through Fourie du Preez and although Montgomery misses the conversion, the Springboks now move ahead to a 23 to eight lead. With around ten minutes remaining the match, Donnie Macfadyen scores a try for Scotland, and with Paterson's conversion, the score moved to 23 to 15 with the Springboks still in front. Montgomery got the final points of the match, with another two successful penalty goals. The final score was 29 to 15.
