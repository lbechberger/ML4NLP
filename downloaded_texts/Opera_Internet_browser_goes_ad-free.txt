Until now the program displayed an advertisement when being used, however the program had an option that would remove the advertisement in return for a fee.
Company Officials expressed hope that this move would prompt more users to download the Opera browser and thus increase the company's revenue from its search engine product.

Opera's features compete directly with Mozilla Firefox, and include tabbed browsing, pop-up blocking, integrated search, mouse gestures and voice control for various features. Its license does not compete with Mozilla Firefox, since Mozilla Firefox is free software, which can be freely modified and redistributed.
