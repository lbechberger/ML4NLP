Nearly a million commuters were immobilized and some businesses closed as Toronto Transit Commission workers walked off the job yesterday and formed picket lines outside subway stations, bus terminals and other TTC facilities. None of their buses, streetcars or subway trains were operational.

Some service in the Greater Toronto Area continued through other transit services, but was of limited use without a link to downtown Toronto.

TTC workers said they'd been locked out, but Toronto Mayor David Miller and the Ontario Labour Relations Board ruled yesterday afternoon that the walkout was illegal and ordered employees back to work. They complied with this order. They had not complied with a cease-and-desist order issued that morning.

Service resumed sporadically during the evening (after rush hour) and is expected to continue as normal today.
