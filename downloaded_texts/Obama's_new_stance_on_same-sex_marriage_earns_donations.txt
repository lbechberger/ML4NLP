Following the announcement this week by U.S. President Barack Obama that he supports the legalisation of marriage for same-sex partners, the Obama campaign claims to have received an increase in donations and support from lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) supporters.


Financial support for Democratic politicians by LGBT groups had fallen to the lowest rate in 16 years, with only $590,000 raised so far in the election cycle. A June fundraising event planned in Los Angeles and focused on the LGBT community is likely to sell out and Obama's campaign team is seeking to expand the event. 


Chad Griffin, the incoming head of LGBT campaigning group the Human Rights Campaign, said that the President's statement on marriage "will further energize an already excited base". Obama supporter and Silicon Valley entrepreneur Wade Randlett said that the announcement "reminds people of the Obama they worked hard for in 2007, 2008. Someone who takes strong, bold stands".

The sex advice columnist Dan Savage wrote on Twitter: "Gay people better get out there and support the president. If he loses in November, we'll be blamed."

Opponents of same-sex marriage have also used the President's statement on the issue to raise money: the National Organization for Marriage (NOM) have run a three-day long "money bomb" fundraiser this week which raised $20,000. NOM plan to increase the amount spent on supporting candidates in federal elections this year.
