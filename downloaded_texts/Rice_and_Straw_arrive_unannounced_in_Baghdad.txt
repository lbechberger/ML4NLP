United States Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and United Kingdom Foreign Secretary Jack Straw have made a surprise visit to Baghdad, Iraq to meet Iraqi officials.

The pair, who have been together for the past few days as part of Rice's visit to the United Kingdom, arrived at 10:30 a.m. local time (0630 UTC) to visit Iraqi Prime Minister Ibrahim Jaafari and Iraqi President Jalal Talabani, among others. Mr. Jaafari, who is of the majority Shia Alliance, is under increasing pressure to stand down after failing to gain adequate support from the opposing Sunni and Kurd minority groups.

According to leading Shia politicians, who are also losing faith in the Prime Minister, the US Ambassador to Iraq Zalmay Khalilzad has claimed that George W. Bush "doesn't want, doesn't support, doesn't accept" Mr. Jaafari's decision to stay at his post. Mr. Jaafari responded by claiming the comments undermine President Bush's commitment to a democratic Iraq.

The unannounced visit comes after her brief trip to Jack Straw's constituency of Blackburn, England, where she faced anti-war protests. At one speech, she admitted that the United States had made "thousands of tactical errors" in Iraq, but later dismissed the comments as being made purely figuratively.
