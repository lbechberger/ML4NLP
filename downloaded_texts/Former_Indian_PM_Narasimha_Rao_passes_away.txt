Mr. P V Narasimha Rao, former prime minister of India, passed away this morning after suffering cardiac arrest in a private hospital in New Delhi. He had been in critical condition for the past few days. He was admitted to the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) on December 9 after he complained of breathlessness. 

Mr Rao has been credited for Indian economic reforms during his tenure from 1991 to 1996, and for supporting then finance minister and current Indian prime minister Manmohan Singh's economic reforms, which allowed for the greatest sustained GDP growth in the country's history. 

He has also faced several accusations of bribery, although he has been acquitted on all such charges.

He was the first person outside the Nehru-Gandhi family to complete his full tenure as Prime Minister. Rao is survived by three sons and five daughters.
