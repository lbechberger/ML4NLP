According to a confirmed report by police, four officers in the Oakland, California police department have been shot and are in critical condition. The incident was reported to have occurred around the 7400 block of the city's MacArthur Boulevard at approximately 1:15 PM Pacific Daylight Time after two motorcycle officers pulled over another vehicle, after which they were both fired upon by the suspect driving the car.

Oakland Police chief Howard Jordan said in a statement that a call was made to the police department at around the same time stating that the two officers had been shot. Police units were then dispatched on a manhunt for the shooter.

At 3:20 PM Pacific Daylight Time, an unnamed caller reported sight of the suspects on a near street, East 27th Street, causing police to create a blockade, surrounding the suspect. This is where the other two wounded officers were shot, this time in an exchange of gunfire while attempting to take the alleged shooter of the two officers into custody. The suspect was killed by police gunfire.

All four of the officers have been taken to Highland Hospital in Oakland, where they are all listed in critical condition. Currently, police are investigating whether there was more than one shooter, but it is believed that the suspect that was attempted to be taken into custody was the only one involved with the crime.
