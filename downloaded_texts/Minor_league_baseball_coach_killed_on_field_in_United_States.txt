An United States man from Tulsa, Oklahoma, was killed by a baseball during a game in North Little Rock, Arkansas, against the Arkansas Travelers. Tulsa Drillers coach Mike Coolbaugh, 35, was struck and killed by a line drive while coaching first base. 

He leaves his wife, Mandy, and two young sons, Jacob and Joseph. Mandy is expecting a daughter who is to be named "Mandy" as well. Coolbaugh spent seventeen years in professional baseball. He played Major League Baseball for two seasons and Minor League Baseball for the remainder, before becoming a coach.

Coolbaugh was coaching first base in the ninth inning, when a line drive off the bat of Tino Sanchez struck Coolbaugh in the head causing him to lose consciousness. CPR was administered on the field. An ambulance transported Coolbaugh to Baptist Medical Center where he fell into respiratory arrest. He later died at the hospital at 10:47 p.m.

The game was then called off in the ninth inning with the Drillers behind 7-3. No make up date has been announced.

The North Little Rock Police Department are currently conducting an investigation, though all indications are that it was an accident.
