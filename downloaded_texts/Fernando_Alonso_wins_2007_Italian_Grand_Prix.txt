Fernando Alonso wins the 2007 FIA Formula-1 Italian Grand Prix at the Autodromo Nazionale Monza, Monza, Italy, with his teammate, Vodafone McLaren Mercedes driver Lewis Hamilton second. The pair won the top two places of the 78th Grand Prix held in Monza, starting from the front line. This win became the first for Fernando Alonso on this track and his another hat-trick.

During most of the free practice and the qualification McLaren seem to be clearly ahead of their rivals from Ferrari, resulting in that Alonso easily took the pole position. Since the start the defending World Champion performed extremely well and stayed in full control of the race. Hamilton's position was not as stable, however, when Felipe Massa overtook him on the start, but the Londoner took back his position on the first chicane.

After ten laps Massa drove his car to the pits, possibly too soon, then suddenly slowed down on the track. It became clear that the race was spoiled for Ferrari team, with only the red car of Kimi Räikkönen, doing his best not to fall too far behind Hamilton, remaining in the race. His risky single pit-stop strategy allowed him to stay ahead of Hamilton for a couple of laps, but the fresh tyres of McLaren after their second pit-stop left no additional chances to Raikonnen who suffered a crash into the wall of tyres in the Friday practice session.

Both BMW Saubers of Nick Heidfeld and Robert Kubica took 4th and 5th places.

Top eight closed by Nico Rosberg's Williams-Toyota, Heikki Kovalainen's Renault and Jenson Button's Honda.

As a result, McLaren strengthen the lead over Ferrari to 23 points, with 166 points total. Alonso is now only 3 points close to Hamilton, who has 92 points.
