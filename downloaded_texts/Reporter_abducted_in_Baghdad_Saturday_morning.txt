Freelance writer Jill Carroll, currently working for The Christian Science Monitor, was kidnapped in western Baghdad Saturday morning. During the abduction, her Iraqi interpreter was fatally wounded, although her Iraqi driver escaped and was unharmed.

Carroll was attempting to gather direct and accurate views of political leaders when she entered western Baghdad's Adil area on Saturday morning.

Christian Science Monitor's editor Richard Bergenheim said, "Jill's ability to help others understand the issues facing all groups in Iraq has been invaluable. We are urgently seeking information about Ms. Carroll and are pursuing every avenue to secure her release."

At present, no one has claimed responsibility for her capture.
