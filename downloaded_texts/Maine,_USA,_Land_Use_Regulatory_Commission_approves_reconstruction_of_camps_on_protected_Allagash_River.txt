The Maine Land Use Regulatory Commission (LURC) affirmed on April 6 its previous finding that two cabins on the Allagash River in northern Maine would be permitted to be rebuilt, the Bangor Daily News reports. The commission's initial decision had been appealed; with this decision, the appeal is rejected. The construction is contentious because the river has been protected by the state since 1966. According to the paper, the commission noted that the task of rebuilding the cabins had been listed in the 2003 River Driver's Agreement. The only mention of the so-called Taylor camps in the 3-page agreement is as follows, under the heading "Creation of Historical/Cultural Visitor Center": "Explore idea of Michaud Farm historic place, that could involve restoration of Taylor camps and historical demonstrations--canoe access only."

According to the Maine Bureau of Parks and Lands, the Taylor camps are three log cabins built in the 1930s by Henry and Alice Taylor. Mr. Taylor worked as the Allagash game warden. The Bangor Daily News noted that the other buildings in the area, such as the Michaud Farm, are not included in the permit that was granted this week.

Local resident Gary Pelletier began reconstructing the cabins in the summer of 2004, but was halted by the appeal of the permit granted by LURC, according to the Bangor Daily News. Now that the appeal has been rejected, Pelletier will resume work. Pelletier is quoted by the Bangor Daily News as saying "We're going to gear up," in reference to his preparations for the reconstruction, Allagash resident and town selectman Roy Gardner that there was an ice jam in the river that he estimated was "ten feet thick" earlier this week, according to an article on April 6 in the Daily News.
