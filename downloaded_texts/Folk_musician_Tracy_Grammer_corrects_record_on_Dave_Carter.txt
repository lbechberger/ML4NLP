Folk musician Tracy Grammer, formerly of the duo Dave Carter and Tracy Grammer, has posted to Wikipedia to correct misrepresentations and misconceptions about her time with Dave Carter, who died of a heart attack in July of 2002. Grammer addressed the persistent rumors about whether she and Carter were involved in a romantic relationship, confirming that they entered into one in 1997, a year after they met, and had lived together from 1999 to 2002, although their relationship had been "in transition" at the time of Carter's death as he began pursuing a gender change in 2002. Prior to her comments on Wikipedia, the only public comment on the matter had been the repeated assertion that Carter and Grammer were "partners in all things" due to their desire to "keep the focus on their music."

Grammer also explained why she did not own the rights to Carter's songwriting catalogue, stating that the rights passed to Carter's ex-wife due to a will dating from before Carter and Grammer began their partnership. Grammer's offer to purchase the catalogue was rejected, and after "considerable acrimony," the catalogue was purchased by Carter's sister, Elise Fischer, who made arrangements with Grammer to administer the catalogue.

An album, Seven is the Number, containing Dave Carter's final recordings with Tracy Grammer will be released in October.
