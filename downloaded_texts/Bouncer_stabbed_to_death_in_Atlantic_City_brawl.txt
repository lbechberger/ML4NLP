A bouncer at the Irish Pub in Atlantic City, New Jersey was stabbed to death Saturday morning while trying to break up a fight.

Luis Martinez, 25, of Newark, was arrested on two charges of aggravated assault for the brawl that left 27-year-old Richard Rivera dead.

Richard Kutch, another bouncer at the bar on St. James Place, was injured and hospitalized after the fight.

Martinez was committed to Atlantic City Jail in lieu of $250,000 bail, with additional charges pending.

The fight occurred around 4:30 a.m. Authorities believe the two bouncers were trying to break up a fight involving Martinez, but they are still trying to determine what sparked the brawl and have declined to released further details.

Media reports said Rivera was well known and well liked by patrons at the Irish Pub, which has been open since 1972.
