Organizers of the upcoming London Live 8 concert have announced that legendary rock band Pink Floyd plans to perform on July 2. Guitarist David Gilmour, bassist Roger Waters, drummer Nick Mason, and keyboardist Richard Wright will play their first performance together since playing at Earls Court, London in 1981.

The band will come together, along with other musical acts such as Coldplay, Elton John, and Paul McCartney for this event. Live 8 is a series of free concerts at each of the G8 nations organized by Bob Geldof. These concerts, set on the 20th anniversary of Geldof's Live Aid, have been planned to support the Make Poverty History campaign, which aims to reduce African poverty. 

This lineup of Pink Floyd has not played together for 24 years due to a conflict between David Gilmour and Roger Waters over leadership and creative influence of the band. However, it seems that they are willing to put their differences behind to support Live 8; "Like most people I want to do everything I can to persuade the G8 leaders to make huge commitments to the relief of poverty and increased aid to the third world," said David Gilmour and added, "Any squabbles Roger and the band have had in the past are so petty in this context, and if reforming for this concert will help focus attention then it's got to be worthwhile."
