Newcastle United appointed Sam Allardyce as manager on May 15, following the resignation of Glenn Roeder on May 6.

Allardyce had turned the opportunity to manage Newcastle down when offered it in the past as he chose to stay on as manager of Bolton Wanderers. However, Allardyce's eight year stint as Bolton manager came to an end following his resignation on April 29, 2007. Allardyce cited that his need for a rest as well as his desire to win silverware was behind his decision.

When asked what made Newcastle a more likely destination for trophies than Bolton, he replied: "Everything about it. The resources, the facilities, the fans, the amount of revenue that can be generated by a club of this size. No disrespect to Bolton, it is a club I love, but this club is massive in terms of what it can achieve."
