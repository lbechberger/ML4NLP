In Auckland's Harbour, a suitcase containing a dead body has been found. Police, first suspecting a possible kidnap and ransom plot, have now arrested two male students from China. They have not been accused of any crime, but they are in custody and "are helping police", as Detective Inspector Bernie Hollewand told IOL reporters.

Specialists say the body had been dead for about 24 hours by the time it was found and had multiple injuries. Forensic police believe that the murder took place in an inner-city Auckland hotel.
