A Muslim preacher has used a Gaza radio station to praise the "blessed actions" of those responsible for the London terror attacks. The unidentified preacher made an appearance Saturday on the controversial station Sawt Al-Quds, during which he praised both the London attacks and the assassination of Egypt's Ambassador to Iraq, Ihab al-Sherif.

In a statement translated by the right-wing Israel National News, the preacher also attributed the bomb attacks in London to Osama bin Laden, saying they were a timely response from the terrorist leader to scenes of public celebration following London's successful Olympic bid. 

"The sirens of joy were heard in Britain, and Osama bin Laden again redrew the map, thus announcing that the voice of the subjugated will be heard everywhere."

Sawt Al-Quds ("Voice of Jerusalem") is a Syrian-based radio station broadcasting to the Gaza Strip. It is believed to be affiliated with Islamic Jihad.

The London bombings have been condemned by many Muslim clerics. Speaking of the response by Iraqis to the London bombings, a UK spokesperson for the Multi-National Division (South-East) said, "Most of the feed back from Friday pray[ers] in the British Area of Operation were against the attacks on London."
