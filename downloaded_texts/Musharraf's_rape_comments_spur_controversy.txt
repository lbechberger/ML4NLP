Sparking controversy and eliciting widespread condemnation in an interview with the Washington Post, Pakistan's President, Pervez Musharraf, has made some poorly-judged comments about rape and rape victims.

Musharaff was quoted as having said, "Rape has become a money-making concern" and he suggested that getting raped was a method of getting a visa to western countries.

Activists and opposition MPs alike condemned Musharaff's comments. The high-profile rape victim, Mukhtar Mai, dismissed the idea that any woman could allow herself to be subjected to such treatment for money. Her case attracted widespread international media attention with it being alleged that her rape was ordered by the local panchayat (town council).
