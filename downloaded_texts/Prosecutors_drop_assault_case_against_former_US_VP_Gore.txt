Former United States vice president Al Gore will not be facing assault charges due to allegations made by a masseuse in 2006, according to the Portland, Oregon district attorney's office.

Molly Hagerty, 54, claimed Gore "sexually assault[ed] me in his [hotel] room." Hagerty was called to Gore's Portland hotel room to give him a massage. Hagerty said Gore pinned her down and "he kept trying to have sex with [her]."

Prosecutors closed the case, but after tabloid National Inquirer interviewed Hagerty they reopened the case. Hagerty refused to take a polygraph test.

Deputy DA Don Rees said there is "contradictory evidence, conflicting witness statements, credibility issues, lack of forensic evidence, and denials by Mr. Gore." 

Rees continued saying Hagerty and her attorneys were uncooperative in the investigation.
