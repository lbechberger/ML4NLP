The Chinese news agency Xinhua reports that there have been two massive explosions within seconds of each other, at about 11:30 p.m. local time, in a warehouse in the port of Dongjiang in Tianjin, a city of 15 million, near Beijing, in north-east China.

At least thirteen people have been killed and between 250 and 400 people injured. Two firefighters are also believed to be missing at the scene. Mobile phone footage taken by locals shows a large fireball in the Binhai New Area of the city. The warehouse is thought to belong RuiHai Logistics, and may have been storing explosives.

The two blasts were significant enough to register approximately magnitude 2.3 and 2.9 on the seismic scale as reported by the China Earthquake Administration.
