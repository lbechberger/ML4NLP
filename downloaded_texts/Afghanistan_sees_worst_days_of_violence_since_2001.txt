A military compound in Southern Afghanistan came under insurgent fire today killing a British soldier and injuring seven others. In response to the attack 10 militants were killed. It is reported that 40 gunmen stormed the Musa Qala district, ensuing a three-hour gunfight between the rebels and the ISAF (NATO). Reports that civilians had been killed prompted Afghan President Hamid Karzai to launch an inquiry into the deaths. British ISAF soldiers took over operations at Musa Quala from a Danish contingent that was attacked almost daily during their tenure.

Brigadier Ed Butler, Commander of the British forces in Afghanistan - "The current tempo of operations in northern Helmand, including those in Musa Qaleh, is demanding, but manageable. We are making good progress in helping to bring security to areas that have had little by way of law and order for over 30 years, most recently with the establishment of a large number of Afghan police in the heart of the town. The Taliban are a determined enemy, and the challenge of bringing security to Musa Qaleh is a continuing one. But we are well on track to succeed."

In Western Afghanistan two police officers were killed and two others injured when insurgents opened fire. Details of the incidents are still emerging. Separate reports indicate they police officers may have been killed by a roadside bomb.

Kabul, which has been spared much of the violence also came under attack today. Four missiles fell in the western part of Kabul in the vicinity of a district police station. No fatalities or injuries were reported.

NATO forces have faced increasing violence in Afghanistan's northeastern and southern districts as of late, increasing tensions between the residents and NATO personnel who's primary mission is nation building, the destruction of herion growth operations and to curb terrorist activities in the region.
