Beginning in 2006, all horses in the EU will be required to have passports, according to new rules from the European Union. Two thirds of all horses in Sweden are estimated to not have passports, Britta LundstrÃ¶m at the Swedish Ministry of Agriculture (Jordbruksverket) told news agency TT.

If the owner of a horse doesn't get a passport for their animal before the end of the year, they will be breaking the law. The Ministry of Agriculture has had problems reaching horse owners who don't read horse magazines. Because of this, the ministry is planning a campaign this autumn.

The passport contains information on the owner, the race and number. A photograph isn't mandatory but a description of the horse's appearance is required.
