U.S. golfer Michelle Wie made the cut yesterday in the 2006 SK Telecom Open in Inchon, South Korea, finishing the second round with a 3-under-par 69 and 5-under-par overall, tying her for 17th overall.

This was Wie's eighth attempt at making it past the halfway point in a men's professional golf tournament. She had played in seven tournaments on the PGA, Canadian, Nationwide, and Japanese tours, failing to make the 36-hole cut in all seven attempts.

The 16-year old golfer from Hawaii became the second woman to accomplish this feat in a Korean men's tournament, after Se Ri Pak made the cut in the 2003 SBS Pro-Golf Championship and went on to finish 10th.
