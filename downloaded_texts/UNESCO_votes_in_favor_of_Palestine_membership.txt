The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization has voted in favor of Palestinian membership in the organization. This coincides with the Palestine bid for United Nations membership also known as Palestine 194.

In early October, the UNESCO executive committee voted in favor for a resolution that allows a vote by all of its 193 members that will decide the membership of the State of Palestine into the organization. 

UNESCO decided in a meeting of its General Council in Paris on Monday to admit Palestine as a full member. 107 votes approved entry, 14 opposed, and 52 abstained. 

The move coincides with the Palestinians' bid for full membership in the United Nations. The United Nations Security Council is currently reviewing the application. Becoming a member of UNESCO is generally perceived as having a positive impact on all of its future bids. 

The Palestinians have been demanding full membership of the United Nations, and this is seen as being one part of that effort. The Palestinian National Authority is now likely to have greater control to nominate potential world heritage sites on the Occupied Palestinian Territories, such as the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem.
