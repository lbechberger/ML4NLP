The International Maritime Bureau, an agency of the International Chamber of Commerce, has stated that 30 sailors were murdered by pirates during 2004. The Bureau's 2004 Annual Report on Piracy and Armed Robbery against Ships shows that the number killed has increased from the 21 who died in 2003, according to data collected by the IMB Piracy Reporting Centre in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.

However, the total number of attacks has decreased--325 recorded attacks, down from 445 in 2003. 

Indonesian waters are the most violent, with 93 incidents; one-quarter of the global total of attacks. Tugs and barges are common targets, with crew members often being kidnapped.

Nigeria has the most dangerous waters of any African country. In 2004, there were 28 attacks (down from 39), the third highest number of incidents in the world.
