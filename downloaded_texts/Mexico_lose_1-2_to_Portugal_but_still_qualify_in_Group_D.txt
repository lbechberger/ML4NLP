Portugal struck two early and held on to beat Mexico in their final Group D match in Gelsenkirchen, Wednesday.

The three goals came in the first period of a match in which Mexico had a player sent off and missed a penalty in the second.



Portugal had rested Deco, Ronaldo and Pauletta but with Figo, Simão and Maniche still packed an offensive threat.

Five minutes into the game Simão ran down the left side of the penalty area and passed a ball square. It deceived the Mexican defence and Maniche, who ran on to it, placed the ball high beyond Oswaldo Sanchez.

The second goal came after 23 minutes when Rafael Marquez reached with his hand to meet a cross from a corner. The resultant penalty saw a theatrical display by Sanchez on the goal line but Simão scored hard to his right.

If Mexico's Omar Bravo had a better game the result might have been a Mexican victory. In the first half he volleyed wide and via a Ricardo leg-save hit the crossbar; on 63 minutes through on goal he blazed over.

Bravo's best chance came on a 56 minute penalty kick after a move of neat passes ended with Miguel's arm connecting with Luis Perez's ball control in the area. Bravo stepped up and hit well over.

Statistics say ball possession was equal and shots on goal were just shaded by Mexico despite the fact Ricardo La Volpe's side had to play the last half hour with 10 men.

Perez received his second yellow card four minutes after Bravo had missed his penalty - sent off for foul simulation in the Portuguese penalty area, in an apparent attempt to get another. 

The biggest threat to Portugal's goal was posed by Jose Fonseca. He got four of six shots on target and scored the only Mexican goal, a glancing header from Bravo's corner kick.

Defeat to Portugal did not alter the top two positions in Group D. Luiz Felipe Scolari's Portugal would next play the team placed second in Group C in the round of sixteen, while Mexico had to play the winner of that group.
