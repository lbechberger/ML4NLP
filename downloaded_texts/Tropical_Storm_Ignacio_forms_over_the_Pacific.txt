The National Hurricane Center (NHC) has upgraded Tropical Depression Twelve-E to tropical storm status. The storm, now officially Tropical Storm Ignacio, is the 11th named storm of the 2009 Pacific hurricane season. 

The storm currently has maximum sustained winds of 50 miles per hour (85 km/h). Ignacio is located 675 mi (1090 km) to the west-southwest of the southern tip of Baja California, and is currently tracking west-northwestward at 12 miles per hour (19 km/h).

The storm is expected to intensify slightly as it tracks into an area more conducive for tropical cyclones, before weakening once it enters cooler waters. NHC forecasters say the storm will most likely remain below hurricane status, and the storm is not currently expected to directly impact land.
