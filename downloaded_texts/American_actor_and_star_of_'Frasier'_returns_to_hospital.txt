American actor Kelsey Grammer has checked into a hospital in New York after feeling faint. It is the second time the actor has checked into a hospital after he suffered a heart attack in Hawaii two months ago. His current condition is not life-threatening. 

According to his publicist, Stan Rosenfield, the symptoms may have been caused by a mix up in his medication. "His doctor is changing the medication and they will monitor him overnight," he said.

Grammer blamed the heart attack on the pressure from his canceled sitcom Back To You; the attack occurred while paddle-boating with his wife in June.

Grammer is best known for his roles on television sitcoms Frasier and Cheers. He won the Primetime Emmy Award for "Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series" three times and one Golden Globe Award for "Best Performance by an Actor" in a TV Series in 2001.
