John McCain, a prominent U.S. Senator from Arizona will launch a 2008 exploratory committee next week, said Republican Party officials. According to an official, McCain has already opened a bank account for the committee.

Aides to McCain say the senator will discuss whether to seek the presidency with his family over the Christmas holiday, and make a final decision thereafter. This decision was later disputed by a McCain advisor, but later evidence showed that McCain in fact has opened a bank account for an exploratory committee.

McCain's team is exploring office space in Virginia, hiring staff and building infrastructure in key early-primary states such as Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina.

In addition, Joe Biden, a US Senator confirmed he will seek the Democratic 2008 Presidential Nomination and will probably hire a Exploratory committee early next year. Russ Feingold, a US Senator from Wisconsin who had previously been suspected to run has denied interest in the nomination saying he wants to continue his work in the US senate.
