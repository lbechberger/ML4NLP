Unconfirmed reports say that at least one person has been shot and killed, and several others were seriously wounded, during a rally against the re-election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, in Azadi Square, Tehran, Iran. Reports say that pro-government militia opened fire on protesters after they attempted to storm a Revolutionary Guard compound.

The defeated candidate, Mir Hossein Mousavi, appeared at the rally and addressed the crowd earlier in the day, in contravention of a ban. In the past few days there have been reports of violence and rioting, with many people arrested.
