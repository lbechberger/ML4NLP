Hugo Ch치vez, President of Venezuela, has accused the United States of supporting a separatist movement in the oil-rich state of Zulia. Zulia has a large portion of Venezuela's oil and gas reserves and is ruled by governor Manuel Rosales, a friend of the United States.

The Zulian political organization, Own Course, a group of right-wingers opposed to Ch치vez, has proposed holding a referendum to form a neo-liberal capitalist economy in the Zulia state which shares borders with Colombia.

Ch치vez described the secessionist attempts as a crazy move and warned that the separatists could face military action. He said that the imperialists are attempting to give strength and form to the secessionist movement, with the goal of controlling the oil in the region.

President Ch치vez also claimed the secessionist movement is part of a plan by the U.S. to overthrow and kill him.
