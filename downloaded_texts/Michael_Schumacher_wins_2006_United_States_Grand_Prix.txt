Ferrari driver Michael Schumacher and his teammate Felipe Massa won the first and second place on the FIA Formula-1 United States Grand Prix on the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. Schumacher became the winner on this track for the 5-th time.

Renault driver Giancarlo Fisicella pushed hard on Ferrari's, but finished third. Fernando Alonso, his teammate, was only fifth.

A major incident right after the start terminated the race for a number of drivers, including the only American Formula-1 driver Scott Speed and both the McLaren-Mercedes cars of Kimi Raikkonen and Juan-Pablo Montoya.

Also tough luck for both MF1-Toyota team drivers, Tiago Monteiro, who collided with Japanese driver Takuma Sato, and Christijan Albers, who ended the race due to technical problems.

The race ended with only nine cars finished, much better though, than a year before, when Michelin's tyre scandal broke.
