The weather forecast on Wednesday 27th July was poor which was unfortunate for Ross-on-Wye citizens, many of whom were dressed in historical costumes to greet the judges for the Heart of England in Bloom visit.

Friends faithfully turned up - women in their Quaker grey and white bonnets, and the Meeting House and burial ground were a hive of activity throughout the day. We welcomed Nelson and his lady, the Town Crier and John Kyrle, a well-known local benefactor from the 16th century as well as representatives from the Elizabethan, Victorian and Edwardian times right up to the world war two era. After some initial hesitation, our children entered into the fun of the day and looked very sweet in their Quaker costumes which they refused to take off at the end of the day.

Four short periods of Worship were held throughout the day and these were well-attended. Many enquiries about our ways followed and local people who had passed the outside gate frequently were surprised to find our 17th century building and the garden and burial ground at the rear. We were informed of a Gold award from Ross in Bloom for our ‘Secret’ garden and community involvement.

A display of old Quaker bonnets was offset by modern tee shirts and the Quakers Today exhibition from Friends House attracted much interest. Contents of a book box sold well and several people expressed their intention to worship with us. It was a good enlivening day.
