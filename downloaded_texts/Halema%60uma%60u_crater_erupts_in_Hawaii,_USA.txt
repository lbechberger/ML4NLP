What began as a new gas vent (fumarole) in Halemaumau crater sometime between March 10 and March 12 2008, has progressed to be the first explosive eruption in Halemaumau Crater since 1924, and the first lava erupted from the crater since 1982. The gases accompanying the eruption have prompted the Hawaii Dept. of Health to announce no-burn days for the island sugar cane industries.

The March 19 explosion of the gas vent partially destroyed the Halemaumau Crater Overlook. On April 9 2008, thousands of people were evacuated from Hawaii Volcanoes National Park and the nearby villages because sulfur dioxide reached critical levels creating a very dangerous vog. The evacuation lasted two days. Two more explosions occurred on April 9 2008 and April 16 2008, the latter spreading a faintly pink ash on the Overlook parking lot. Scientists think molten lava may reside at a shallow depth within the new vent.

Halemaumau is a pit crater located in the summit caldera, of KÄ«lauea, Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. The roughly circular caldera measures 3x5 km (or 6x6 km, including the outermost ring faults). According to the traditions of the native people, Halemaumau is home to Pele, Goddess of Hawaiian volcanoes.
