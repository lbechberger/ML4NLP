A royal decree published in Thailand's Royal Gazette has endorsed the lifting of martial law in 41 of the country's provinces. Martial law has been in place in the country since a coup on September 19 that ousted populist Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra.

The remaining 35 provinces will remain under martial law. This includes the south of the country which has been experiencing a separatist insurgency, and parts of the country where support for the ousted Prime Minister is still strong.

Indications that the restrictions put in place by the army appointed government would be lifted came as early as October last year when current Prime Minister Surayud Chulanont mentioned the possibility during a visit to Indonesia.
