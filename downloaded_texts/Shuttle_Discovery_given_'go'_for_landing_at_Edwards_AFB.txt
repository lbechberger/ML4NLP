The Space Shuttle Discovery STS-114 has been given a 'go' for landing at Edwards Air Force Base today. 

The de-orbit burn is expected at 6:06 a.m. Central Daylight Time (CDT) (Mission Control's local time), and landing is expected at 7:12 a.m. CDT. Weather conditions are clear at landing site, with scattered clouds at approximately 20,000 feet, with winds peaking at about 12 knots at the number 22 runway, which is where Discovery has been cleared to land. 

Shuttle Pilot Jim Kelly will be providing the human piloting for the main part of the flight, with Shuttle Commander Eileen Collins taking over most of the piloting duties as Discovery enters the subsonic range.
