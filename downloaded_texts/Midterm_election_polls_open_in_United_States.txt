With the polls now open throughout most of the United States (US), voters are reporting long lines as US citizens line up to vote in the 2006 United States general elections, frequently referred to informally in the US as the "2006 midterm election". Predictions of an unusually high level of voter turnout seem to be coming to fruition as voters throughout the country report longer than expected lines. One voter from Kansas City, Missouri reported a 90-minute wait, while voters in southwest Michigan reported that they had to park several blocks from the polls because of the crowds. Typically, fewer than 40% of registered voters go to the polls during non-presidential election years. The highest midterm voter turnout on record occurred in 1970, when 47% of registered voters went to the polls.
