The Australian Medical Association (AMA) announced that it has withdrawn from the Northern Territory National Emergency Response.

The AMA head, Rosanna Capolingua, said that working with the Government has been fraught with problems and is too costly. 

Prime Minister Kevin Rudd said that he is not concerned about the future of the Northern Territory Intervention and that the Australian Government would look at other organizations to take over the AMA's role. 

The Northern Territory National Emergency Response also known as the Intervention was put in place by the former Howard Government in response to the Northern Territory Government's Little Children are Sacred report.
