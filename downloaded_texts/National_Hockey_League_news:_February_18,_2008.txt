There were 8 games played in the National Hockey League on February 17, 2008, including the top two teams in the West, the Detroit Red Wings and the Dallas Stars, going head to head.


A goal by Jerred Smithson put the Predators on the board early, his 5th goal of the season. Petteri Nummelin would put the Wild on the scoreboard just past the half-way point of the first period on a break-away, assisted by Eric Belanger. Mark Parrish would give Minnesota their first lead of the game with 23 seconds left in the opening period. Pierre-Marc Bouchard would add to the Wild lead at 14:19 in the second period with a power play goal. Martin Erat would cut the Wild's lead in half at 4:05 in the third, but Marian Gaborik would score his 31st goal of the season on a delayed penalty to put the Wild back ahead by two moments later. Nashville would tie the game when Ryan Suter scored at 8:54 in the third period, and Shea Weber scored on a Predator power play at 14:05. No goals would be scored through the rest of regulation, so the game was sent into overtime. Pavol Demitra passed across to Gaborik, who beat Nashville goalie Chris Mason, to win it for the Wild with 4 seconds left in the 4-on-4 overtime. Gaborik had a three point night, with two goals and an assist on the Parrish goal.
