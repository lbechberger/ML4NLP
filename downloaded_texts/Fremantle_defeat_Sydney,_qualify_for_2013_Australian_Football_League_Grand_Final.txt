The Fremantle Dockers defeated the Sydney Swans 99 to 74 this past Saturday in their Australian Football League preliminary final at Patersons Stadium, Perth, Western Australia. Fremantle will play the Hawthorn Hawks in their first Grand Final appearance in their 19 year history. 
 
The 25 point win over the reigning premiers, Sydney, came as a result of an early push by the Dockers, who led by 39 points at half-time. The Swans came to the game missing several key players, including Adam Goodes, who is recovering from a knee injury. 

Top goal kickers for Fremantle were Michael Walters, Matthew Pavlich, Nick Suban and Nathan Fyfe, while Sydney's Gary Rohan and Harry Cunningham were their only dual goal scorers.

Fremantle led by 43 points at three quarter time in front of a crowd of over 43,000, securing a place in the Grand Final despite six late goals from a resurgent Sydney. They are now scheduled to play Hawthorn, who beat Geelong 102 to 97 to qualify for the Grand Final this coming Saturday.
