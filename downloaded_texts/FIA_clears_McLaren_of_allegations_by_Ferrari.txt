FIA governing body ruled not to penalize Vodafone McLaren Mercedes because of the lack of evidence that the team used the information possessed by Mike Coughlan, team's ex-Chief designer, improperly to gain an advantage in the championship.

World Motor Sport Council agreed that McLaren breached the article 151c of the International Sporting Code by unauthorised possession of 780 pages of Ferrari's technical documentation.

Still, if Ferrari could prove the use of those documents by McLaren to commit detriment to the championship the team will face the possibility of exclusion from not only the 2007 championship but also the 2008 championship.
