A female teacher was fatally stabbed late Monday morning at the she taught in at Leeds, West Yorkshire, England, in front of students. A 15-year-old pupil is being questioned about the incident and police recovered a knife at the scene.

The female teacher, Ann Maguire, 61, was stabbed in front of her class of 30 while teaching a Year 11 Spanish lesson in the secondary school Corpus Christi Catholic College on the outskirts of Leeds. Maguire was sent to hospital with multiple stab wounds, but later pronounced dead. Police recovered a knife at the scene and arrested a 15-year-old pupil, whose name hasn't been released.

At the end of September, Mrs Maguire planned to retire after teaching for nearly 40 years, more than 10 years spent as the Head of Year 11. Describing the killing, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom David Cameron said it was "profoundly shocking and absolutely appalling". Leeds authorities emphasised the isolated nature of the incident. Other staff members in the school said they restrained her attacker at the scene after being drawn there by screams. The police were then called at 11:48am. It was also announced professional counselling would be given to the pupils.

The incident follows an investigation from Sky News finding nearly 1,000 United Kingdom pupils in the past three years were caught in schools with weapons. It also comes in the aftermath of an alleged 'Columbine-style' plot from Michael Piggin, 16, a year older than the alleged attacker of Ann Maguire. Piggin's alleged plot reportedly included multiple targets including his former school in Loughborough, Leicestershire; Loughborough University; and a local cinema.
