Following an attack on Israel by Palestinian militants, Palestinian Authority (PA) Interior Minister Nasser Yousef has declared a state of emergency. Yousef claims militants opened fire on PA security forces when the security forces stopped the militants firing rockets into Israel. In the firefight 6 militants were injured. Other firefights have broken out in northern Gaza. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) blame Hamas militants for the attacks.

A masked militant in Gaza City told reporters "Resistance is legal and as long as the Zionists are violating the Hudna, or truce, no one would prevent us from responding to these violations, and we would cut the arms of those who would try to halt us".
