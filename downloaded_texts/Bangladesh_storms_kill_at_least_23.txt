Stormy weather in Bangladesh left at least 23 people dead over the weekend and thousands more homeless. The storms, which are common between April and June, swept over the Mymensingh area and destroyed crops and trees.

Most of the deaths were said to have occurred when farmers harvesting rice paddy fields were struck by lightning. Six were in the Habiganj District. Additionally, the lightning killed two teenage brothers in Haluaghat tending to cattle in a field near their home. 

Dozens of other people received injuries and were transported to hospitals. The Bangladesh Meteorological Department had issued warnings for continued severe weather.
