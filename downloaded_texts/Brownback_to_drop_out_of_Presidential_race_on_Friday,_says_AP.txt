The Associated Press is reporting that Republican Kansas Senator Sam Brownback is expected to drop out of the presidential race on Friday in a speech scheduled in Topeka, Kansas. "I know Senator Brownback enjoyed campaigning and meeting new people in talking about ideas for the future of America, but I think it came down to money," an anonymous source told AP. "It's just time," said a source to Reuters. "He is not going to endorse anyone else right away." 

In an interview with Wikinews, Brownback confirmed money was an issue. He reported raising only US$800,000 in the third quarter of this year, his lowest since entering the race. Brownback said he was baffled by how poorly candidates appealing to the Christian right were doing in the Republican party primaries. "Why we haven't gotten more traction," Brownback said, "I don't know." Originally Brownback said that he would pull out if he did not finish better than fourth in the Iowa caucus; AP's report anticipates a sooner-than-expected announcement. 

"That a guy can grow up on a farm in Eastern Kansas and run for President of the United States," Brownback reflected, "I love a country like that."
