Following the days since Steve Irwin died of a stingray attack, at least 10 stingrays have been found dead on two Australian beaches, with their tails cut off. While it was reported that fishermen occasionally cut the tails off stingrays they accidentally catch to avoid being stung, however, state fishery official Wayne Sumpton said that this practice was "uncommon".

It is suspected that these killings were done in revenge for Irwin. "That's the last thing Steve would want," said Michael Hornby, a friend of Irwin. However, other sources point out that fans of Irwin would generally not commit such actions.

In general, stingrays are not aggressive and will not attack unless provoked.

Meanwhile, a public memorial service for Irwin is planned next week.
