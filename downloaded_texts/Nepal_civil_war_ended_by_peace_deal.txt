Nepal's 10-year civil war has come to a peaceful conclusion with the signing of a historic accord between Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala and Prachanda, leader of the Maoist rebel faction that had been fighting for political change. The deal was signed in Kathmandu on Tuesday.

The deal would allow the Maoists into the Nepalese government, and place both Maoist and government weapons under UN scrutiny. The Maoists had been observing a ceasefire since its declaration more than six months previously.

Prachanda said that the peace agreement would end the 238-year old feudal system. He added that his party would work with new responsibility and make new strong Nepal.

Meanwhile, Koirala said that the deal ended the politics of terron and violence and started the politics of co-operation. He thanked Prachanda to find out a peaceful solution in the country.

The government and the Maoist rebels were accused of human rights abuses in fighting that killed more than 13,000 people.

Nepalese king Gyanendra Singh has welcomed Tuesday's peace deal between the government and the Maoist rebels.
