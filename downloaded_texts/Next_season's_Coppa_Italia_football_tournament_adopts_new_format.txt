A new format will be in place this year for the Coppa Italia (TIM Cup).

72 clubs will take part - all 20 from Serie A, all 22 from Serie B, and 30 clubs from Serie C.

All but the 8 Serie A clubs participating in UEFA's European competitions will begin play in the first elimination round. Those 8 will not join until the Round of 16.

The clubs will be seeded 1 (Inter, as defending champion) through 72 with matchups determined accordingly (not through a random draw). So in the first round, #9 seed will play #72, #10 vs #71, etc.

The first three rounds will be just one match, at the field of the lower-seeded team. Overtime and penalties will resolve ties (not replays). From the Round of 16 on, ties will be home-and-away.

The calendar:

* Aug 7 - First elimination round
* Aug 14 - Second elimination round
* Aug 21 - Third elimination round
* Nov 30/Dec 8 - Round of 16, 1st leg
* Jan 5 - Round of 16, 2nd leg
* Jan 25 - Quarterfinals, 1st leg
* Feb 1 - Quarterfinals, 2nd leg
* March 22 - Semifinals, 1st leg
* April 12 - Semifinals, 2nd leg
* May 3 - Final, 1st leg
* May 11 - Final, 2nd leg
