Chinese media and former ROC President and spiritual leader of the pro-independence TSU Lee Teng-hui (李登輝) responded on Monday to the massive rally held Saturday in Taipei.

In mainland China, the China Daily published an editorial under the headline, "March sets stage for secessionist scheming" in which it labeled the rally as "secessionist scheming" and a "misuse of people power".

China Daily said of President Chen that, "his participation in the protest added to his record as a man of bad faith. Only one month ago, Chen solemnly pledged to develop cross-Straits relations during his meeting with PFP chairman James Soong. Unfortunately he has failed to honour his word."


In Taiwan, former President Lee Teng-hui (李登輝) asked for the ROC government to follow up on the large turnout with concrete measures.

The Taipei Times quoted Lee, "The March 26 march ended perfectly, yet it wasn't just the close of a political carnival." Lee continued, "It was a new starting point for consolidating people's identification with Taiwan and declaring the Taiwanese people's strong will to defend their right of self-determination."
"That 1 million Taiwanese people came out was a display of the mainstream of Taiwanese public opinion, and officials should respond to that with practical actions and policies," Lee told a symposium. "Otherwise the march will just have been emotional venting, which won't solve the current [cross-strait] problems."

Lee made his remarks at the Taiwan Advocates symposium.
