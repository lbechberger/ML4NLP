A new television advert for Diet Coke featuring singer Duffy has been cleared by the Advertising Standards Authority in the United Kingdom after they received twenty two complaints.

The advert depicts Duffy cycling through a supermarket during a concert she was performing in. Eighteen viewers complained because she was not wearing reflective clothing and her bicycle had no lights. Four other viewers complained because they believed children could copy her actions.

ASA upheld Coca Cola's argument that the ad was supposed to reflect Duffy's fantasy and her escape from the pressures of celebrity and that children would realise cycling around a supermarket was not a realistic idea.
