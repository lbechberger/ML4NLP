On May 27, 2008, in Salt Lake City, Utah, a woman stole two 14-karat gold bracelets from a pawn shop by swallowing them, as shown by a surveillance tape. The bracelets were worth US$2000 each according to the pawn shop.

The clerk noticed the bracelets were missing minutes after she had swallowed them and asked the woman for an explanation. She responded, "You can search me." The bracelets were not found. It was only clear who the thief was after the shop reviewed the surveillance footage.

Norma Porchas-Robles, 41, who had been a regular customer at the shop for over four years, has been charged with retail theft and will appear in court June 19. The pawn shop, however, must continue to do business with her, as she had pawned several items which have not yet been sold.
