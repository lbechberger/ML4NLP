Finland now holds the world record for the longest non-stop round of karaoke singing. The country already holds the record for the largest number of karaoke singers at any given time.

The previous record was 145 hours, as held by China. However, in a karaoke bar in Kouvola, a small town on Finland's southern coast, the record was surpassed on Wednesday, with the ultimate goal being 240 hours non-stop.

Finns travelled long distances to participate at the event, which was broadcast live on the internet.

The record goes alongside Finland's other record for karaoke, that of the largest number singing at any given time. This is held by 80,000 fans of the Finnish hard rock band Lordi, who had met in Helsinki for the band to give a brief free concert to celebrate their victory at that year's Eurovision. The show culminated with all 80,000 joining in with the band on the winning song, Hard Rock Hallelujah.
