Bob Barker, the out-going host of American TV game show The Price Is Right has taped his final show.

"I will regret not being at the show, I know, probably for the rest of my life because I've enjoyed it so much," said Barker, 83, who has been host of the show for 35 years.

The audience, who is also a pool of possible contestants, gave a round of applause and a standing ovation. Confetti was also sprayed about to celebrate his time with the show.

His final words were, "Help control the pet population. Have your pets spayed or neutered." Barker has said those words at the end of every show for many years. The show originated on September 4, 1972.

The finale will air on 15 June. A new host has yet to be determined but auditions have started in December 2006. The show and its staff have won six Daytime Emmy Awards. Barker has won seventeen Emmy Awards for hosting the show.
