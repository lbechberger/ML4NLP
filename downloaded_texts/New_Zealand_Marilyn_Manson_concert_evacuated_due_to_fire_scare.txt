A New Zealand Marilyn Manson gig was evacuated after a fire scare. Four songs into the performance by the shock rock act at Auckland Town Hall, a fire scare caused an evacuation of the venue. On-site security stopped the performer from continuing and asked the audience to leave immediately.

Fire and ambulance crews responded, but discovered that the alarms had been caused by dry ice smoke machines.

Manson was able to continue his performance after a delay of ten minutes.
