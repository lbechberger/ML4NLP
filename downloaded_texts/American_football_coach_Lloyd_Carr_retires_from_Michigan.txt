University of Michigan Wolverines head coach Lloyd Carr, who had coached the college football program for thirteen years, announced his retirement from the coaching profession, effective after the Wolverines' bowl game.

"Yesterday was one of the most emotional days of my life," Carr said at his press conference, referring to when he informed his team of his retirement. "I’ve cried more tears than I knew I had. I’ve never laughed so hard in my life. There’s so many memories. It was a wonderful day."

During his tenure at Michigan, Carr won five Big Ten Conference championships and a national championship in 1997. He had a disappointing 1-6 record vs. Jim Tressel's Ohio State Buckeyes, though his overall record vs. Ohio State was 6-7. Carr's last victory over Ohio State came in 2003. He amassed a 121-40 overall record while at Michigan and ranks seventh among active coaches with a 75.2 winning percentage.

There has been a lot of speculation, even before Carr's retirement, regarding who would become the next Michigan head coach. Current Louisiana State University head coach Les Miles is viewed as the top candidate to replace Carr.

Observers see Les Miles as the front-runner despite his recent comments. "I want to stay just where I’m at," Miles said. "I don’t want to think about it. Don’t want to envision it. I want to go forward and prepare."
