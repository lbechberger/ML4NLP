A high school student is in custody tonight after the alleged shooting of another student in the second floor hallway of a Saginaw High School in Michigan Thursday. According to Saginaw Public Schools spokesperson Michael Manley, the incident occurred during the lunch period at Saginaw High School.

Manley stated in an email that both the victim and the suspect attended the Saginaw Juvenile Center during the same periods. Both students were accepted into the school district at the beginning of the school year.

Following the incident, Manley stated that metal detectors have been installed inside the school, and that all students and visitors are required to pass through them starting Friday morning.

The victim was taken to a local hospital, where his condition has been reported as critical but stable. It is expected that the student will survive.

Earlier this year, high schools in the area rescheduled all night events to take place during earlier times in the day, due to an increase in security concerns. When asked about the increase in violence, Manley said "The violence we have experienced has been the result of community problems, feuds, disagreements, etc. that have found there way into schools."

The high school had previously been a target in a shooting last month. No injuries were reported.
