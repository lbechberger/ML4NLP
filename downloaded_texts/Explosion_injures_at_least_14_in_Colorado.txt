At least fourteen people were injured today by an explosion at the remote Electric Mountain Lodge, in Paonia, Colorado.

The blast was reported at 2:30pm local time (9:30 UTC).

A county investigator suspects that the explosion was caused by propane gas.

"We're starting to get patients now, but I can't tell you how many we're expecting â€“ a bunch," hospital administrator Tom Mingen told Denver's CBS4 news from Delta County Memorial Hospital. He continued, "Electric Mountain Lodge is probably in the most remote part of our county. About 20 miles north of Paonia and 17 miles in by snowmobile."

The lodge, located in the Gunnison National Forest area at an elevation of 9,200 feet, is only accessible by helicopter or snowmobile during the winter season.
