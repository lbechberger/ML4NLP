Brian Fields, a retired United States Air Force Colonel, has photographed what he claims are two UFOs hovering over his home in Van Buren, Arkansas.

Fields said, "I believe these lights were not of this world, and I feel a duty and responsibility to come forward. At first I thought they were landing lights from an aircraft. As I continued to observe them they began to slowly disappear, then suddenly one reappeared, followed by two, then three. On at least one occasion four or five appeared. Each time they would slowly fade and eventually disappear. This occurred several times and when they would reappear they might do so in differing numbers and in different positions, sometimes in a triangular shape, sometimes stacked on top of each other, sometimes line abreast, etc. When the objects appeared they might stay illuminated 10 or more minutes. I'm certain it wasn't an aircraft [from Earth]. It's not anything I ever had any experience with. ... They were some kind of energy or something.â€� 

Fields ruled out the possibility of the UFOs being flares saying that the movements made by the UFOs did not resemble that of a flare. In 1997, lights seen over Arizona and Nevada were also claimed to have been UFOs before the US Air Force identified them as flares dropped by an airplane on a training mission. 

Fields, now 61, was in the military for almost 32 years of his life, flying F-16 fighter jets.
