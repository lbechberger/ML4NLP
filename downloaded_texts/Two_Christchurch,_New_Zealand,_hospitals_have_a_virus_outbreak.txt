Two Christchurch hospitals, Christchurch Hospital and Princess Margaret Hospital, have had an outbreak of norovirus.

A special isolation ward in the Christchurch Hospital has been setup for 20 patients and 12 staff, who have contracted the disease.
Princess Margaret Hospital has also setup similar conditions.

Norovirus causes severe vomiting and diarrhoea. People who get this disease usually recover within 48 hours.

It is possible to get this disease from infected's vomit or feaces, contact with the sick, eating infected food, or touching infected surfaces.

Visitors are urged to stay away from wards 23 and 29, where the outbreak occurred, unless it is absolutely necessary.

This happened in 2004, as well, when 200 patients and staff got the disease.
