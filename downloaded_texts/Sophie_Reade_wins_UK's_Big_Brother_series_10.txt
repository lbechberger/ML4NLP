Glamour model Sophie Reade has won the tenth series of the British version of reality TV show Big Brother.

Sophie is a 20-year-old from Nantwich, Cheshire, England who has posed nude for Playboy UK and changed her name to "Dogface" for the purposes of getting onto the show. She won the prize fund of £71,320 (US$118,846) on the final on Friday night, beating runner-up contestant Siavash Sabbaghpour, with final votes of 74.4% to Siavash's 26%. Sophie was also the bookmasters' favourite to win.

She said: "I never thought I could win...I could hardly believe it." The British public earlier phoned in and voted David Ramsden third, Charlie Drummond fourth, and Rodrigo Lopes fifth.

Channel 4, the channel which has been showing Big Brother in the United Kingdom for the last ten years, recently announced that next year's series would be the last due to a decline of six million viewers since the 2002 series, which got a maximum of eight million viewers. Kevin Lygo, Channel 4's Director of Television, said that Big Brother "had reached a natural end point on Channel 4 and it's time to move on".

Production company Endemol have said that they were enormously proud of their partnership with the British television channel and stated: "We have every intention of celebrating the show's historic run on Channel 4 with great final series of both Celebrity Big Brother and the summer series in 2010. As for 2011, stay tuned. Big Brother will get back to you…"
