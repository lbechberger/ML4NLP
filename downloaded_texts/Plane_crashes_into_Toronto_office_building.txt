A Cirrus SR-20 aircraft crashed into an office building in Markham, a town near Toronto, at 12:30 p.m. local time yesterday. Both people on board were killed.

The aircraft, which crashed into the roof of the two-storey building at Woodbine and Hooper streets, was engulfed in flames. Witnesses say that it looked as if the pilot was trying to find somewhere to land and that the aircraft was trailing smoke and rolled before it crashed.

First reports state that the pilot and passenger were killed on impact, and the 14 employees at Thinkway Toys manufacturing all escaped the two-storey building and explosions from the crash.

The crash site is near Buttonville airport where many amateur and flight training flights occur.
