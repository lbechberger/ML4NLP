Honolulu police on Saturday fatally shot a man who reportedly fired a shotgun at them on a residential street in rural Oahu.

Police received a call at about 6:30 p.m. HST that a man in a black trench coat had fired a shotgun at a parked car on Kaukama Road in Ma'ili, on the west coast of Oahu. The Specialized Services Division of the Honolulu Police Department was called to the scene.

When officers ordered him to get out of the car, the gunman fired a shotgun at the officers, then pointed two handguns at an officer, who fired at the gunman, hitting him in the head. The man was pronounced dead at the scene.

The officer involved has been placed on administrative leave, as per standard HPD procedure after a fatal shooting.

The gunman was later identified as Tracy Peters, 47, who had a long criminal history with 23 criminal convictions, including drug possession, firearms violations, and second-degree robbery. 

Peters had reportedly been experiencing family problems, and had warned acquaintances that he was going to do something drastic. "The next time you see me, I'm going to be in a casket," he said.
