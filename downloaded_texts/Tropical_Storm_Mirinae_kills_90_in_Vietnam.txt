Vietnamese media reported on Wednesday that at least 90 people have been killed after Tropical Storm Mirinae passed through the country. Another 22 people were reported to be missing.

According to Vietnam News, the storm completely destroyed 154 houses, damaged 2,500 others, and flooded 1,800 hectares of farmland. Some dikes in the Phu Yen province were overloaded with water, further exacerbating the damage.

Around 2,000 soldiers were dispatched to assist with rescue efforts, and local authorities had asked for food aid from the government.

The Vietnamese disaster committee said that "it's the most devastating flooding in more than 30 years in Phu Yen."

Two people were also killed by Mirinae in neigbouring Cambodia, and a further 27 in the Philippines.
