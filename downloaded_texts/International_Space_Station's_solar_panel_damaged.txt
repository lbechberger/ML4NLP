Astronauts and ground controllers are looking at apparent damage to the International Space Station P6 4B solar array spotted by the crew during deployment. NASA halted the deployment of the solar array wing to evaluate the damage. Deployment is about 75 percent complete with 25 of 31 bays deployed.

The crew has been asked to photograph the area on the solar array wing and downlink the images to the ground.

Shuttle Discovery is presently docked to the ISS during mission STS-120.
