B'Tselem, an Israeli organization purporting to be seeking the improvement of human rights in the West Bank, released a short video, showing a soldier shooting from close range at the feet of a blindfolded Palestinian protester. The Israel Defense Forces soldier used a rubber coated or plastic bullet. The Palestinian man, Ashraf Abu Rahman 27, says he was lightly wounded at his toe due to the shooting. He also claims to have been beaten up earlier during the protest. 

B'Tselem says a lieutenant colonel was at the scene, responsible for tying the man before the shot was taken and demands an investigation. Later, Israel authorities announced that they arrested the Israeli soldier whose picture was on the video for investigation.

The shooting which took place on July 7 in Nilin, West Bank. Was taken slightly after a violent protest against the construction of Israel's separation barrier. Some Palestinian rescue organizations claimed that ten Palestinians were shot by the rubber bullets during this protest.

The separation barrier, which was decided upon following a wave of Palestinian suicide bombings in Israel during the Second Intifada, has been a source for contention due to what the Palestinian claim to be land grabbing by the Israeli government.
