London, England â€” At London's Olympic Basketball Arena last night, Australia men's national wheelchair basketball team decisively beat South Africa by a score of 93 to 39 before a crowd of 2,106. The game was the first played by both teams at the 2012 Summer Paralympics. Justin Eveson led Australia in scoring with 21 points. Richard Nortje led his team in scoring, and was the only South African player to reach double digits in points scored. Australia's next match is against Turkey, and South Africa's next match is against Spain later today.
