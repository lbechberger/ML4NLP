In a policy change prompted by activists staying in Gaza protesting Israel's plan to close Jewish settlements there, Israel announced that nonresidents will not be allowed into the territory.

Israel's Southern Command on Thursday announced "only residents of the Israeli communities in the Gaza Strip will be allowed [entry into Gaza]", where the Jewish state plans to end its decades-long presence. 

Israel also will stop issuing permits to close relatives of settlers.
