Chicago Cubs manager Lou Piniella announced Sunday that he will retire from Major League Baseball after almost fifty years of coaching, managing, and playing the sport. 

Piniella's announcement came after the Chicago Cubs lost to the Atlanta Braves 16-5 at the Cub's Wrigley Field. The 66 year-old Piniella said that he was retiring because of family issues. For much of the 2010 MLB season, Piniella's 90 year-old mother has been ill.

"This will be the last time I put on a uniform. This has been very special for me. I'll go home, do what I have to do there...and enjoy my retirement," said Piniella. "My mom needs me at home; she hasn't gotten any better since I've been here. In fact, she's had other complications. Rather than continue to go home, come back...It's not fair to the team, not fair to the players. The best thing to do is to step down, go home and take care of my mother," he added.

During his 18 year career as a player, Piniella logged 1,705 hits. As a manager, he also won 1,800 games over the course of 23 years. Mike Quade, The Cub's third-base and outfield coach, will be Cubs manager for the remainder of the 2010 season.
