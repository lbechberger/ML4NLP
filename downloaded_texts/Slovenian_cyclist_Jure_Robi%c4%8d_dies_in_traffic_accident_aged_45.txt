Jure Robič, the Slovenian cyclist who won the Race Across America five times, has died in a traffic collision at the age of 45. Robič died after colliding with a 55-year-old driver whilst riding down hill in Jesenice. He was on a training ride in preparation for the Australia's Crocodile Trophy mountain bike race. An investigation into the accident is underway.

Robič was a five-time winner of the Race Across America men's solo, with his first victory in 2004. He dropped out of the 2009 race whilst in second place due to a time penalty he felt he unfairly received. His last victory in the race was earlier this year. Robič's five wins is a record in men's solo races.

Before competing in ultra-marathons, Robič was a member of the Slovenian national cycling team from 1988 to 1994. He twice set the world record for the 24-hour road race and won the Race across Slovenia three times. During his career he had over 100 victories and 150 podium finishes.
