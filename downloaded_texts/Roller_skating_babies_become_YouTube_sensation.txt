Registering 5,081,441 views in the past week alone, an international advertisement featuring roller-skating babies has become a YouTube sensation. French and US versions of the advert for Evian mineral water have also seen 500,000 and 1.5 million visitor hits respectively.

"It's one of the cutest things I've ever seen," said one YouTube viewer. Reviewer Saul Relative says, "You'll find yourself watching this feel good video commercial again and again."

The babies roller-skate to a remix of The Sugarhill Gang's top 40 hip hop single Rapper's Delight.

Euro RSCG began the web video campaign on Friday, July 3. The advertisement has been aired on television in France, Belgium, and Canada. "It's working so well virally that plans for TV in the UK are still under review," said an Evian representative.
