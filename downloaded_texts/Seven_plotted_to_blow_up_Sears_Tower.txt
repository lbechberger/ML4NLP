Seven people arrested in Miami allegedly planned attacks on Sears Tower in Chicago and other buildings as part of pledge to al-Qaeda to wage war against the United States. They are also accused of having planned attacks on FBI buildings.

Attorney General Alberto Gonzales said Friday that "seven young men arrested in Miami were part of a group of "homegrown terrorists" who sought to work with al-Qaida but ended up consorting instead with a law enforcement informant."
