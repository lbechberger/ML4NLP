Former Genesis band member Phil Collins has announced that he will never play the drums ever again. 

Collins says his decision is due to a spinal injury which makes it too painful for him to hold up his drumsticks. In an interview with British tabloid, the Daily Mirror, Collins, age 58 said, "I've got a condition that means I can't play any more. After playing drums for 50 years, I've had to stop."

"Obviously I'm very sad about it. My vertebrae has been crushing my spinal cord because of the position I drum in. I can't even hold the sticks properly without it being painful. I even used to tape the sticks to my hands to get through," added Collins who also said that he is still able to sing.

One of Collins' friends said to the Daily Mirror, "He is devastated as drumming is everything to him. It's how he made his name and it set him on the road to superstardom."
