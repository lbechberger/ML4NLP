An airline stowaway, possibly of Senegalese origin was found dead this morning by U.S. customs and NY Port Authority personnel, his body badly mangled by the landing gear of a South African Airways aircraft.

A Nassau County woman returned home from work to find part of the man's leg lying on her lawn.

The identity and nationality of the man are not yet known. The flight on which he stowed away originated in Johannesburg, South Africa and made one stopover in Dakar, Senegal.
