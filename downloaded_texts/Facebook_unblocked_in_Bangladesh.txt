After a week's block, the social networking website Facebook is finally back in Bangladesh. Facebook was blocked by local authorities in Bangladesh after some "offensive" content of local politicians were uploaded and one man was arrested. 

The block was lifted 23:58 local time (17:58 UTC). According to BDNews24.com, Mir Masud Kabir, the Mango Telecom Services managing director, had received a phone call from Major General Zia Ahmed at 11:57 p.m. (17:57 UTC), asking him to lift the Facebook block. Kabir unblocked Facebook a minute later.

The authorities had decided to unblock Facebook after the company promised to remove the content considered blasphemous as well as the "obnoxious" pictures of the country's leaders.
