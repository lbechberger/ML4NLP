Expedition 10 Commander Leroy Chiao, on board the International Space Station (ISS), caught a candid shot of the Shuttle craft Discovery on its way to launch pad 39-B at the Kennedy Space Center.

Chiao used a digital camera from an altitude of 220 statute miles to photograph Discovery during its roll out in preparation for the first launch of a shuttle in the two years since the Columbia disaster. The shot was made at 4:35 Eastern Daylight Time when the ISS flew over the launch site.

Two pads at Launch Complex 39 are visible in the image. Discovery's launch pad, 39-B, is on the left.
