On Saturday, it was announced that the first non-white Governor had been elected for the State of Louisiana in the United States in over 100 years. He is also the youngest Governor ever elected in Louisiana.

Bobby Jindal, 36, an Indian-American and Republican, won the election receiving 54% of the votes, with the nearest opponent, Walter Boasso having only 18% of all votes.

"Let's give our homeland, the great state of Louisiana, a fresh start. They can either go quietly or they can go loudly, but either way, they will go," said Jindal during his victory speech. He plans to improve education throughout the state and cut taxes.

The local and statewide results from Louisiana's primary election yesterday have cast doubt upon the theory that the Republican Party was injured politically from the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina.

Jindal will be sworn in as the fifty-sixth Governor of Louisiana on January 14, 2008.
