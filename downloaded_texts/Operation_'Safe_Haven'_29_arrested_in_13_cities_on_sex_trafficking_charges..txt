Federal authorities arrested 29 people in 13 cities across eight states on sex trafficking charges, as part of a sweeping southern states operation called “Safe Haven,” according to US officials. 

The undercover investigation identifies a loose organisation of independent traffickers who worked together to transport and exploit Hispanic women for prostitution in southern states, authorities said. 

The arrests were made in Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Florida, North Carolina, South Carolina and Texas. 

"Human sex trafficking is a cancer that we must cut out, and then aggressively fight with all of our resources," Michael Moore, the U.S. attorney for the Middle District of Georgia, said in a news release.

Investigators also rescued 15 people they believe are victims during raids on brothels and homes, authorities said. 

The victims were either kidnapped and forced into sexual slavery, or were promised a better life then held them hostage by keeping them financially invested or threatening to shame their name or their families. 

Operation ‘Safe Haven’ began in July 2014 and is lead by U.S Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents. The task force directed significant intelligence, funding and analytical support from multiple DHS agencies to strengthen the special agents investigating this criminal network. 

"To the criminals behind these illegal enterprises, these women are just pieces of meat used to pull a quick profit and then discarded or passed on to the next trafficker down the line," said Special Agent in Charge Nick Annan, who heads ICE's Homeland Security Investigations division in Atlanta.
