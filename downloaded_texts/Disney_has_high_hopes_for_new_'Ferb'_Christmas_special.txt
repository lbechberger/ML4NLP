The Walt Disney Company has today announced the inclusion of a Christmas special in its animated comedy series Phineas and Ferb. The special, entitled "Phineas and Ferb's Christmas Vacation," will follow the series' protagonists, stepbrothers Phineas and Ferb, trying to spread Christmas cheer across their city after the mad scientist Dr. Doofenshmirtz uses a machine to cancel the holiday.

Disney has high expectations for the special. On November 27, the company will stream one of the seven musical numbers that will be showcased in the special on its public radio network Radio Disney. The official special is set to air accordingly the following month on December 6, 2009, on the company's cable network Disney XD. Soon after, it will air on fellow Disney networks Disney Channel and ABC Family.

The crew of the series too have high hopes for the Christmas special. Zac Moncrief, who directed the special, announced that he believes it will "go down in history as a cartoon classic." When asked about the special, co-creator Jeff "Swampy" Marsh explained, "It's kind of intimidating. You sit down and think, 'This is something that's going to live at Christmas for a long, long time.'" Dan Povenmire, the other co-founder, said of his excitement over the featured musical numbers, "[H]opefully they'll be songs that this generation of kids will think of as Christmas songs the same way that kids think of 'Dahoo dore' (from 'How The Grinch Stole Christmas') or 'Rudolph The Red-Nosed Reindeer.'"
