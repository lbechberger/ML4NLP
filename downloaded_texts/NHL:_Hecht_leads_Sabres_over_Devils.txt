The Devils came into Wednesday night's game trailing the Buffalo Sabres by five points in the Eastern Conference, and with the Pittsburgh Penguins hot on their trail. New Jersey needed the win to close the gap to three points, and to stay ahead of the Penguins. Neither happened, however, as the Sabres defeated the Devils before 18,690 at HSBC Arena in Buffalo, New York.

Just 1:55 into the first period, Jochen Hecht scored his first of two goals, his 18th of the season, assisted by Jason Pominville and Dmitri Kalinin, who would pick up two assists in the game. At 6:42, Scott Gomez responded for the Devils to tie the game at 1-1. Patrik Elias and Brian Rafalski were credited with assists. In the second period, Buffalo would make it 2-1 at 7:25, when Daniel Paille, assisted by Adam Mair and Teppo Numminen scored. The Sabres scored again at 11:47, when Jochen Hecht would tally his second goal of the game from a pass by Daniel Briere. Dmitri Kalinin was also credited with an assist on the goal. Trailing 3-1, New Jersey came back with their own goal at 13:49, when Paul Martin picked up his third goal of the season, narrowing the deficit to one goal. Ales Kotalik would put the game out of reach at 15:52, when he would beat Martin Brodeur for his 15th goal of the season. Dainius Zubrus, along with Chris Drury, would be given credit for assisting the play. With two seconds remaining in the game, the Devils Zach Parise scored, but it was too late, as the Sabres would hold on for the win.

Martin Brodeur saved 19 of 23 shots faced. Ryan Miller, the 3rd star of the game, stopped 28 of 31 shots faced, accumulating a .903 save percentage in the game.
