At dawn this morning a team of 250 policemen, some armed, some in chemical weapons gear, stormed a building in Forest Gate, London, England.  Two men were arrested in the raid made under the 2000 Terrorism Act.

Deputy Assistant Commissioner Peter Clarke, the Meteropolitan Police's anti-terror chief, said he had acted on specfic intelligence: "we planned an operation that was designed to mitigate any threat to the public either from firearms or from hazardous substances." 

The injury to the man who was shot was not life threatening and the Independent Police Complaints Commission, who have opened an investigation into the incident, say a single shot was fired. At Royal London Hospital where the man, later arrested, was taken armed guards were seen at the entrances.

The man who was not shot, said to be 20 years old, has been questioned at Paddington Green police station. Others at the address have been moved out - two residents have been treated in hospital for shock.  

The search at the house in Lansdown Road is said to be ongoing. Police have closed Lansdown Road, Rothsay Road and Prestbury Road and a blind has been errected around the premises. The Civil Aviation Authority report a four-day "no fly area" below 2,500ft is in force over east London.

British intelligence agency MI5 and the Health Protection Agency also had a role in the operation, which British Prime Minister Tony Blair had been told about. The suspected bomb nest is not thought to be linked to the London tube and bus bombings in July 2005.
