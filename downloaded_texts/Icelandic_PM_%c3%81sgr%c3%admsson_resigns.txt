The Icelandic Prime Minister, Halldór Ásgrímsson, announced his resignation on June 5 after the governing Progress Party suffered losses in recent local elections.

Ásgrímsson's successor will be Minister of Foreign Affairs Geir Haarde. Haarde is leader of Ásgrímsson's coalition partner, the conservative Independence Party.
