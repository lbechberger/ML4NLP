Egyptian rescue workers have ended a search for possible victims of a collision between two ferries on the Nile River.

Local officials said that they found no bodies and have accounted for everyone, after initial reports suggested dozens of passengers and crew members were missing following the collision on Friday. 

Rescuers searched on Friday night and early on Saturday for possible victims; officials say at least six people were injured.

The two ferries collided near the northern city of Rashid, causing one of the boats to overturn. At least 30 people were on board the boats at the time of the accident. Officials are investigating the cause of the incident.
