Police are currently on the hunt for a suspect in two Ontario, Canada, murders.

22-year-old Jesse Imeson, a native of the Windsor, Ontario area, is already wanted for the first-degree murder of Carlos Rivera, 26, a bartender at a gay strip club in Windsor, last week. Now Ontario Provincial Police are issuing a Canada-wide warrant for him in connection of the slaying of an elderly couple in their rural home near Grand Bend, on the shore of Lake Huron.

"I have to stress again the importance of not approaching the individual and contacting police immediately," says Ontario Provincial Police Const. Jeff Walraven on Tuesday. "We'd much rather deal with a suspicious person at the time than have to deal with the circumstances that arise."

Investigators have warned the public to be on the lookout for a grey 2006 GMC Sierra pickup truck with the licence plate JK8334. It is the slain couple's vehicle and they suspect that Imeson has stolen it.
