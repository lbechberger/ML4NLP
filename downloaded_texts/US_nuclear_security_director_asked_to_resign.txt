The head of the United States National Nuclear Security Administration, Linton Brooks, has been forced to resign due to security issues. United States Secretary of Energy, Samuel Bodman asked for Brooks' resignation because of issues including "serious security breaches" in several laboratories, including the Los Alamos National Laboratory.

In a statement issued by Bodman, issues such as lab management were brought up. 

:"The deputy secretary and I repeatedly have stressed to NNSA and laboratory management the importance of these issues being addressed, rectified and prevented in the future. While I believe that the current NNSA management has done its best to address these concerns, I do not believe that progress in correcting these issues has been adequate."

Brooks issued a statement to President Bush, and NNSA (National Nuclear Security Administration) employees, saying that he would resign "shortly".
