The BC Teachers' Federation (BCTF) and the government have both accepted mediator Vince Ready's recommendations. 

Premier Gordan Campbell announced in a news conference today that he will accept the plan unconditionally.

However, Jinny Sims (head of the BCTF) has said that she will only accept the proposal if the government provides firm class-size numbers and support for special-needs students.
"We need for our students a guarantee in writing that this government will make changes to the School Act to put firm class-size numbers" Sims also said, "And in the School Act, they will address class composition. And that means support for special needs kids".

Sims will recommend to her union to accept the proposal if these conditions are met.

Key points of the proposal to which both sides have agreed include:
* Government spends $40 million to "harmonize" teachers salaries across BC
* Another $20 million is spent on top of current funding to reduce class-size and help special-need students. This brings that funding up to $120 million.
* The government consults with the BCTF about how class-size reduction should take place.
* The government puts $40 million (one-time) into the unions long-term disability fund.
* The government raises pay for substitute teachers to $120 a day.
"I believe the recommendations provide a fair basis for resolution of the present dispute, especially in the context of the additional opportunities for the BCTF to address these and other issues in the next few months," Ready's report said.

If the union votes this weekend, classes could be in this Monday.
