Having drawn with Israel twice in their last two games, the Republic of Ireland football squad have received a much needed confidence boost. They beat the Faroe Islands 2-nil away to earn the three points which takes them to the top of Group 4; one ahead of Switzerland. However the Irish have seven games played - one more than most of the other Group four members.

After a fruitless first half, Ireland gained the upper hand in the 51st minute thanks to a solid penalty taken by Ian Harte. The penalty was given after the home team's keeper, Jakup Mikkelsen, brought down Stephen Elliott.

The second goal came shortly after when Kevin Kilbane found the back of the net to finally settle the Irish nerves.
