Four men were arrested at 04:30 BST (4:30 a.m.) in police raids at two addresses in Birmingham, West Midlands in relation to the failed London bombings of 21st July. 

One of the four men, arrested in Heybarnes Road in the Hay Mills area, is thought to be suspected of being one of last Thursday's bombers, and has been taken to the high security Paddington Green police station in London. Police have acknowledged using a Taser stun gun in the arrest, but no firearms were used.

The other three arrests were made shortly afterwards in Bankdale Road, Washwood Heath. Police said a suspect package was found at one of the addresses and local residents were evacuated. 

Two men were also arrested at Grantham railway station after information was received from off-duty policemen on a GNER train travelling between Newcastle and Kings Cross.
