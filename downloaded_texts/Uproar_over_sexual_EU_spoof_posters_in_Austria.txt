Posters produced and printed by the art project 25peaces, in Austria have caused huge public outcry and debate. The posters depict Britain's Queen Elizabeth, having sexual intercourse with US president George W. Bush, and French President Jacques Chirac. A number of public figures including Wolfgang Schuessel, the Austrian Chancellor, have publicly denounced the posters.

Its creator, artist Carlos Aires, says he had no desire to offend anyone, "I suddenly had this image of three decision makers who are having an orgy while everything around them collapses".
