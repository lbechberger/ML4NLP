In October 2015, the courts of New Delhi sentenced a 26 year old man to prison for 7 years. for raping a woman. After two years of India's legal landscape fighting to catch up with the social need to address rape, it is a significant legal precedent. It is one of the first cases in India where a rape case has been persecuted based primarily on the victims testimonial. 

The 26 year old man working for the Delhi Police, was repeatedly raping an Indian woman who was also an employee of the Delhi Police. The woman was a divorcee, and the rapist would insist that he was raping her as he intended to marry her. Even though the victim struggled to maintain a straight story, the man was still found guilty. The court states that "It is well settled that the evidence of a hostile witness, to the extent, it supports the case of the prosecution, can be relied upon, if it is corroborated by other reliable evidence."

The case is of great importance to India’s law enforcement as it sets precedent for other hearings. It recognise that "Though prosecutrix, during her cross-examination, resiled and took a U-turn from what she had deposed in examination in chief, but her such reversal does not falsify or negate her categorical deposition made during examination in chief which has been found to be natural, clear, convincing, reliable and trustworthy," says Delhi Judge MC Gupta.

Furthermore, during sentencing, the judge echoed India’s Supreme Court in saying, “sexual violence is not only an unlawful invasion of right of privacy and sanctity of woman but also a serious blow to her honour...It leaves a traumatic and humiliating impression on her conscience, offending her self-esteem and dignity. Rape is not only a crime against a woman, but a crime against the entire society."

The social movement to better address the crime of rape in India began when a woman was gang raped on a bus in Delhi in 2012. In 2013, India amended and implemented laws to better protect victims of rape.
