A power line to the Fukushima I Nuclear Power Plant in Japan was completed Thursday, which will allow cooling systems at one of the facility's reactors.

The new line, roughly one kilometer (0.6 miles) in length, connects the power grid to the power plant's second reactor. It was completed at about 1730 local time (0830 UTC) on Thursday, and will be energized once spraying of seawater over reactor three is complete.

According to a Tokyo Electric Power Company spokesperson, once the power line is energized "we will be able to activate various electric pumps and pour water into reactors and pools for spent nuclear fuel," thus cooling temperatures within the reactor.

The International Atomic Energy Agency has said that the stricken power plant is currently stable, though there is still the chance of matters growing worse. An official at the agency said that "it's reasonably stable at the moment compared to yesterday."
