North Korea has again agreed to abandon its nuclear weapons and development programs.

The country agreed to again return to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and follow International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards. 

Five other countries have agreed to give North Korea energy assistance. There also would be discussion "at an appropriate time" about providing a civilian light-water reactor.

The day after the agreement, North Korea demanded the new reactor before it ends its other nuclear programs. U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said the light-water reactor issue was to be discussed "down the road" â€” not immediately.
