A Philippine daily reported that peasant group Kilusang Magbubukid ng Pilipinas (Peasant Movement of the Philippines or KMP) plans to file electioneering case against Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) claiming that fully armed troops have been deployed in various areas around the country with strong presence of progressive organizations and party lists groups.

The military says that politicians running for elections have sought the military's protection against what it says is harassment and extortion by the Communist Party of the Philippines and its military wing, the New Peopleâ€™s Army.

Danilo Ramos, KMP Secretary General, said they also seek to exclude AFP members from voting in the upcoming May elections, pointing out the possibility of the soldiers as "flying voters".

Prior to that, another group, an urban poor organization Kadamay, hit the increased presence of soldiers in areas where the group is active. The group suspects that the deployment of soldiers in a number of barangays in Quezon City and parts of Metro Manila is an attempt to flush out activist leaders.
