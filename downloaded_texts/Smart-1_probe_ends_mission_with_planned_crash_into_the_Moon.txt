"Our closest neighbour remains an enigma," writes The Times Science Editor, Mark Henderson, "It is the celestial object that lies closest to us... ...yet, despite the proximity we, there is still uncertainty about what it is made from and where it comes from." 
Common theory is that the Moon was created after a large asteroid hit the Earth four and a half billion years ago breaking of large chunks which later formed the Moon. Evidence for this would be provided if the Lunar chemical structure closely matches that of ancient earth. The SMART mission is the first step in performing this analysis.

Observatories around the world watched the skies early on Sunday morning as a European space probe, the SMART-1 crash landed on the Moon; the first time a European made object has landed there and, as the first, it made quite a bang. For the culmination of its three-year mission the probe left its orbit around our nearest neighbor and smashed into the Lake of Excellence at around 4,500 mph. The impact created a brand new crater and scattered debris up to 30 miles, in contrast to the gentle touchdown of the Eagle lander (when Neil Armstrong became the first man on the moon) 37 years ago.
