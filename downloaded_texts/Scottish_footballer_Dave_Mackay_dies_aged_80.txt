Scottish footballer Dave Mackay died in an English hospital on Monday. He was 80.

"Dave was one of the most influential players of his era[...] a superb player who possessed all the technique, passing ability and talent to be the complete footballer", said Tottenham Hotspur, an English team Mackay played for in the late fifties and early sixties.

Mackay's career took him to England after competitive success at Scottish team Hearts, where he was captain. With Hearts he won the Scottish Cup and twice won the Scottish League Cup. He won three FA Cups, one being a 'Double' won in the same year as the English league, with Tottenham Hotspur. He also appeared 22 times playing for the Scottish national side.

In the early seventies Mackay turned his attention to managing, taking the top job at various English and Middle Eastern sides. Derby County won the league under him in 1975. Mackay's management career continued until 1995. He has held the title Footballer of the Year in both Scotland and England.

Late Manchester United player George Best has previously called Mackay the "hardest man I have ever played against". A minute's applause is planned as tribute when Scotland takes on Northern Ireland at home on March 25.
