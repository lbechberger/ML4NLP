Bertie Ahern has today announced that he intends to stand down from the office of Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) on the 6th of May. Mr. Ahern made the announcement today at a press conference in Government Buildings in Dublin. Ahern's imminent resignation comes on the back of over a year of controversy surrounding payments received by him in the early 1990's while he was serving as Minister of Finance. He has been forced to give evidence on these payments to a tribunal of inquiry and his evidence there is ongoing. 

Mr. Ahern has been a TD (MP) for 31 years and has been Taoiseach for the past 11 years, making him the second longest serving Irish Premier after Eamonn de Valera. He won a record 3rd term in office following the general election last year. He currently leads a coalition of his own party Fianna Fáil, the Green Party, the Progressive Democrats and various independent politicians.

Ahern noted, "Never, in all the time I've served in public life, have I put my personal interests ahead of the public good." Further going on to say, "I have never received a corrupt payment, and I've never done anything to dishonor any office I have held." Adding, "I know in my heart of hearts I've done no wrong and wronged no one."

Táiniste (Deputy Prime Minister) and Minister of Finance Brian Cowen is expected to succeed Mr. Ahern as both Taoiseach and leader of Fianna Fáil.
