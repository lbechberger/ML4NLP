Finland is to be represented at the Eurovision Song Contest 2008 by heavy metal band Teräsbetoni with their song Missä Miehet Ratsastaa (Where Men Ride).

Teräsbetoni picked up 38.9% of the vote, with Kari Tapio second at 33.9% and Cristal Snow came third with 26.5%. The selection show was arranged as three qualifying rounds, with two songs selected to go through from each. The remainder competed again amongst themselves for one wild card position, then it went to the public vote.

Teräsbetoni will compete on May 20 in the first of the Eurovision semi finals for a place in the final. Both events will be held in Belgrade, Serbia.

Finland won the contest in 2006 when hard rock band Lordi's Hard Rock Hallelujah scored a record 292 points. However, the following year in Helsinki Finnish entrant Hanna Pakarinen's Leave Me Alone finished outside the qualifying positions for this year's contest at number 17, with 53 points, meaning that if Teräsbetoni are to make the final they will have to qualify.

Missä Miehet Ratsastaa was released as a single by Warner Music Finland on February 2.
