Law enforcement authorities in New Orleans are confiscating firearms, sources in the city say. The confiscations come after a wave of gun violence swept over the flood-ravaged city, with looters shooting at other refugees, police and military authorties, rescuers, and even hospital personnel.

"Only law enforcement are allowed to have weapons," said police superintendent P. Edwin Compass III. And although this is being enforced, private guards with permits are being allowed to keep their firearms.

Blogger Michael Barnett, who is manning a New Orleans datacenter, said he would turn in his weapons if authorities came for them. "I'm not gonna die on the 10th floor of this building to enforce my right to keep and bear arms."
