Chad has declared their border with Sudan a "military operations zone" and has also declared a "state of belligerance" exists between Chad and Sudan. Chadian President Idriss Deby described Sudanese President Omar Hassan al-Bashir as an "enemy of Chad." The government also called on its citizens to "mobilize against this Sudanese aggression." This comes at the heels of increased aggression between the two nations, namely the December 18 attacks against the border town of Adre.

While the Chadian government fell short of declaring war against Sudan, this is the toughest statement President Idriss Deby has made so far. [cited] link title
