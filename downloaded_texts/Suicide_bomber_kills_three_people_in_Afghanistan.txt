A suicide bomber has killed three people and wounded eight others in the southern town of Spin Boldak in the Kandahar province of Afghanistan on Saturday, according to the local police.

The explosion happened after a man detonated a motorcycle containing explosives at a bus station.

"Including the suspect, five were killed and eight were wounded," said the police chief, Jawad Ahmad.

Ahmad said the bomber had stopped near a restaurant at a bus station when the motorcycle exploded. The police chief said the man had wanted to blow up a police station, but the bomb had gone off before reaching the target.

The town of Spin Boldak is located in southern Afghanistan, and is a major crossing point between neighbouring Pakistan.
