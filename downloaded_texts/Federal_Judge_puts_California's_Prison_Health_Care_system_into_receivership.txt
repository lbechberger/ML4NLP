U.S. District Judge Thelton Henderson of San Francisco has ordered the state's health care system for prisoners be put under the control of a receiver to stop deaths of inmates due to medical malfeasance. The system provides medical care to 164,000 inmates at a cost of US$1.1 billion annually. Reportedly the judge described conditions in the state's medical system as barbaric. The appointment of a receiver was the last resort available after repeated failures of Governor Schwartenegger's administration to improve medical conditions at state prisons.
