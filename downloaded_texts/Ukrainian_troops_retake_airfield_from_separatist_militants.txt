Yesterday, Ukrainian troops seized an airfield from pro-Russia separatists in the nation's east. The attack comes after warnings from officials in Moscow not to interfere with the minority groups in regard to civil unrest.

The acting Ukrainian President Oleksandr Turchynov spoke prior to the mission, stating that it would be "conducted step by step, responsibly, cautiously". Reports of up to eleven deaths during the seizure have since emerged; Ukrainian officials have denied the claims. 

The airfield resides near the city of Kramatorsk, in the Ukraine region of Donetsk notable for its population of ethnic Russians. 

Geneva is to host an international conference held on Thursday; it is feared Russia may leave the meeting. UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon's press office said the secretary-general told Russian President Vladimir Putin he should help "de-escalate" the situation.
