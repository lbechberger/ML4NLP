Kenny McKinley, an American football player for the Denver Broncos, has been found dead at the age of 23. The wide receiver was found dead in the master bedroom of his home in the Denver suburbs. The cause of death is suspected to be suicide by a self-inflicted gunshot to the head.

President and CEO of the Denver Broncos Pat Bowlen released a statement about McKinley's death on the Broncos' official website. He said "Everyone with the Broncos is shocked and saddened by the loss of Kenny McKinley. He was part of the Broncos family and will be greatly missed by our organization. My most heartfelt condolences go out to Kenny's family and friends."

Andrew Bondarowicz, McKinley's agent, said McKinley had been visiting family in Atlanta and had only shortly returned to Denver at the time of his death.

Originally from South Carolina, McKinley was selected in the fifth round of the 2009 NFL Draft. In college, he became only the 12th player in SEC history to collect more than 2,700 receiving yards.

McKinley has become the third young Broncos player to die in recent years. Darrent Williams was shot dead on New Year's Eve in 2007 and Damien Nash died after he collapsed during a charity basketball game a month later. ESPN's Adam Schefter said on his twitter page "No NFL team has been hit harder than Denver. Darrent Williams, Damien Nash. Kenny McKinley. RIP."
