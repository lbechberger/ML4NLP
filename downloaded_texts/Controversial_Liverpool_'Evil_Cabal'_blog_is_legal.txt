Merseyside Police concluded after a brief inspection that the controversial blog Liverpool Evil Cabal does not break criminal law. However the council officers continue to search for the editor.

The blog has been blocked on computers controlled by Liverpool Direct Ltd, a company jointly owned by Liverpool City Council and British Telecom. The council's elected officials have denied ordering the block and are currently investigating its origin.

Previous fights between Liverpool city councillors and executive staff have resulted in controversy before, most notably in the resignation of leader Mike Storey and CEO Henshaw.
