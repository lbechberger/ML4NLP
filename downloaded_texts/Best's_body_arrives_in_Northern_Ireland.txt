The body of former Manchester United player, George Best, has arrived in Northern Ireland. It was flown into RAF Aldergrove, on a chartered plane accompanied by his son, Calum, and his agent, Phil Hughes. Bests Family, including his father Dickie were waiting at the runway of RAF base in County Antrim.

Mr.Bests body was then driven in a black herse along a 20-mile route to the home of Best's father, Dickie, in the Cregagh Estate in east Belfast, where it will be kept overnight.

Up to 500,000 people are expected to line the streets to Stormont, the Northern Ireland Parliament buildings, where a public funeral ceremony for the former Manchester United and Northern Ireland football player will be held tomorrow.

Mr Best died at the Cromwell Hospital in London last Friday afternoon, aged 59. A private family service will be held at Best's Fathers home, which has been turned into a shrine to his son. Then a service will take place in the Great Hall at Stormont, before Best is buried in a private family service beside his mother Ann at Roselawn Cemetery. Among the people attending the private ceremony will be Best's lifelong friend Denis Law, Harry Gregg and Derek Dougan.
