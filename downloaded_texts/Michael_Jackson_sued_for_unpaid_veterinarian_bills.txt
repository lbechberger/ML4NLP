Martin Dinnes, the owner of Dinnes Memorial Veterinary Hospital, alleges that Michael Jackson owes him over $91,602 in veterinary bills.

The pop star's exotic animals were looked after by the veterinarian at the Neverland ranch, where Jackson has not lived in since the last child molestation trial in June 2005.

Dinnes helped Michael acquire animals for his zoo which include flamingoes, giraffes, elephants and orangutans.

His lawyer, Brenton Horner, stated that Dinnes filed this lawsuit with great reluctance. "He has a lot of admiration for Michael. This is just a business matter."

A hearing was set for May 2.
