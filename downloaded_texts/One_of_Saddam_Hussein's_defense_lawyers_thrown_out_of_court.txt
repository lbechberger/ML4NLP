Bushra Khalil, one of the defense lawyers for former Iraqi President, Saddam Hussein, was thrown out of court by Chief Judge Raouf Abdel after speaking out of turn.

"The right of defence is sacred. We have never seen in our whole career a lawyer ordered out of the court room like this. We should not be treated like this, we are defending those men who defended the honour of the nation, yes they are the honour of the nation," said an Egyptian lawyer, in court for Hussein's defense.

Khalil was attempting to make a speech when Judge Abdel told her to stop talking. When Khalil continued to speak out of turn, Judge Abdel ordered court guards to remove her from the courtroom. Khalil then threw her lawyer's robe onto the floor and walked out of the courtroom.

"You have to stick to the rules, you are a lawyer, you should behave by the rules," said Judge Abdel to Khalil while she left the courtroom.

Hussein objected to the judge's orders and protested saying, "I am Saddam Hussein, president of Iraq. I am above all."

"You were president, now you are the defendant," replied Judge Abdel.

This is the second time that Khalil was thrown out of the courtroom. Back in April, Judge Abdel had Khalil removed for the same reasons. This is also her first appearance in court since April's incident.
