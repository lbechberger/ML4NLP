Air New Zealand, national airline of New Zealand, played the movie The Queen in-flight where a bleep occurred when someone said "God". However in another in-flight movie, The Departed, a lot of swearing occurred but it wasn't censored at all, according to a passenger.

Both of the movies were played on the same Air New Zealand flight from New Zealand to London.

Pam Wong, spokesperson for Air New Zealand, claimed that they had been given the wrong version of the film, The Queen, starring Helen Mirren.

Air New Zealand has apologised for playing the censored film, stating that it is not Air New Zealand policy to censor any words.

Ms Wong said: "We don't have a policy of censoring any of our material because we have parental locks on movies with extreme violence or inappropriate language. A 'new version' should be available soon."
