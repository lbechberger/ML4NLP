Three soldiers of the United Kingdom, part of NATO's mission in Afghanistan, ISAF, were killed in what is thought to have been a "friendly fire" incident, according to the UK Ministry of Defence. Two other soldiers were injured in the incident on Friday, when the soldiers were bombed by US F-15 jets which had been called to provide support after the patrol came under attack.

The apparent friendly fire incident took place Thursday evening northwest of Kajaki in Helmand province when the British troops were attacked by Taliban insurgents. The ministry said that "during the intense engagement that ensued, close air support was called in from two US F-15 aircraft to repel the enemy. One bomb was dropped and it is believed the explosion killed the three soldiers."

The military said next of kin had been informed and said the incident would be investigated.

73 British soldiers died in Afghanistan since the start of the war in 2001.
