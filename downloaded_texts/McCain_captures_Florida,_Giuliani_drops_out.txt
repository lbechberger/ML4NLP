United States Senator John McCain (R-AZ) has won the State of Florida's Republican Party primary election, edging out former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney by five percent (36 versus 31%). With this win, Sen. McCain is now clearly the frontrunner going into next week's Super-Tuesday primaries.

One time GOP front-runner Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who placed a lagging third in Florida, the state he based his campaign on, dropped out of the race Wednesday, largely because he had no previous primary wins and dwindling support.

The mayor endorsed McCain, a long time friend. McCain was quoted saying: "I want to thank my dear friend, my dear friend Rudy Giuliani, who invested his heart and soul in this primary and who conducted himself with all the qualities of the exceptional American leader he truly is".

Democratic Senator and former First Lady Hillary Clinton, also from New York, won the Democratic primary in Florida; however, due to Democratic Party policy, the state has been stripped of its delegates.
