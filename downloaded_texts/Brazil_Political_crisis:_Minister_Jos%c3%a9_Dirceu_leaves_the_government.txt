The Brazilian Minister of Civil Affairs José Dirceu announced this evening his resignation from the government of President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.

During his discourse José Dirceu said that he will return to his earlier position as a representative in the national congress allied with the Workers Party. He said that he will defend the government against those "who want to interrupt the democratic process and want to destabilize the government of president Lula". He said that he is leaving with "clean hands", "a heart without bitterness" and with "a raised head".

Dirceu is the victim of a serious political crisis in Brazil because of accusations of governmental corruption. Dirceu was one of the most important ministers in President Lula's government.

The crisis worsened after declarations of Roberto Jefferson, president of the PTB, a party allied with the PT.
This Tuesday, Jefferson said to a Congressional Commission that minister José Dirceu and the President of the Workers' Party, José Genoíno, were involved in the payment of bribes to Brazilian congressional representatives.
