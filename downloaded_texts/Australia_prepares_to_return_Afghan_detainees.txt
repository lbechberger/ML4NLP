Australia is preparing to send 19 Afghan nationals back to their country of origin under a new agreement with Afghanistan. The Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) offers AU$2,000 per individual and up to AU$10,000 per family, along with travel and other accommodations, for the detainees to voluntarily return. Failing that, those Afghans found not to be refugees are liable to be deported.
