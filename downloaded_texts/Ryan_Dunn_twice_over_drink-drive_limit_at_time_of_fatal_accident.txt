Televison star Ryan Dunn was twice over the legal drink-drive limit at the time of last Monday's car accident that killed him and a friend. The pair died when Dunn's Porsche left the road and crashed into a tree causing the car to burst into flames. Police have determined that the vehicle was travelling at speeds between 132 and 140 mph.

The accident occurred in West Chester, Pennsylvania where the legal drink drive limit is a blood alcohol reading of 0.08. Toxicology results show that Dunn had a blood alcohol level of 0.196. The star had previously been caught drink-driving in 2005.

Dunn made a name for himself after appearing in the television series Jackass. He starred in the TV series as well as the three follow on films that were produced. Recently he had also began to present his own television shows Homewrecker and Proving Ground.

Tributes have been paid Dunn by several of his co-workers and friends. Creator of Jackass Johnny Knoxville described him as a "brother" and rock band Kings of Leon asked fans to raise a glass to Dunn during a concert on Wednesday. The band's bassist, Jared Followill, said on Twitter he was "devastated" by the death of his friend.
