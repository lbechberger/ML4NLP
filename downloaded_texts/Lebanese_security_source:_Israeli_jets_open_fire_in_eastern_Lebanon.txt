Reuters is reporting that according to a source with Lebanese security, Israeli aircraft fired rockets at a Hezbollah stronghold at or near the village of Bodai.

An Israeli army spokesperson reportedly said they were checking into the report.

If confirmed, this would be the first overt action since the cease-fire after United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701 that sought to end the 2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict.

Lebanon condemned the operation as a "flagrant violation" of the six-day old truce.

"The operation was aimed at preventing the delivery of weapons to Hezbollah from Iran and Syria," an Israeli army spokesman said, adding that "all goals were achieved".
