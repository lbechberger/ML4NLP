Afghan security forces, along with the United States led coalition are reported to have killed about 70 suspected militants in Afghanistan. According to US authorities, Afghanistan is currently experiencing its highest level of violence in the last 6 years. 

The surge in militant attacks comes despite a multi-million dollar reconstruction effort to rebuild the shattered country and the presence of more than 50,000 foreign troops and 110,000 Afghan police and military officers. It was not possible to independently verify any of the death tolls because travel to the areas is extremely dangerous.

More than 4,200 people - most of them insurgents - have been killed so far this year, according to an Associated Press count.
