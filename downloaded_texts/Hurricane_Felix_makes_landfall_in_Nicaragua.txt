Hurricane Felix made landfall in Nicaragua on Tuesday. It reached shore as a Category 5 hurricane, the strongest level of such storms. Within hours, winds had weakened considerably and Felix became a Category 1 hurricane as it moved inland. There remain concerns of potential mudslides due to the heavy rains which continue. From Nicaragua, the storm system appears headed towards Guatemala and Honduras.
