According to the Associated Press (AP), 2008 United States Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton has told lawmakers in New York that she is "open to being Obama's vice presidential candidate".

Earlier, the AP reported that Clinton would concede her race for the White House tonight during a speech in New York City, something her campaign denied.

"The AP story is incorrect. Senator Clinton will not concede the nomination this evening," said Clinton campaign officials in a statement to the press.

The report comes from New York lawmakers who participated in a conference call with Clinton. Nydia Velazquez, a New York lawmaker, stated to Clinton that she should seek being the running mate for Obama because it would win him more votes from the Hispanic and African American populations in November.

"I am open to it [being vice presidential candidate] if it would help the party's prospects in November," stated Clinton, speaking in a conference call with other politicians.
