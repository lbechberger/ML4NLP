Tarja Turunen, a Finnish symphonic rock artist best known for being the former frontwoman of symphonic power metal band Nightwish, has been scheduled to appear at the 25th anniversary concert of heavy metal vocalist Doro Pesch. Pesh, like Turunen, first gained fame fronting a band, in her case Warlock.

Doro and Tarja are now also confirmed to be planning to record duets with each other. Doro will feature on Tarja's next solo album, while Tarja will sing a role in Doro's upcoming 25th-anniversary album.

Tarja announced the planned duets at the same time as confirming her appearance at the December 13th concert in DÃ¼sseldorf, Germany's ISS Dome, where she says she will perform "a new song and an old song". At the same time, Norwegian symphonic metal band Leaves' Eyes have also been confirmed for the event.

When making the announcements Tarja also said "there will be a co-operation between me and Doro in the future" although it was unclear if this refers to a more permanent arrangement or simply that which has been announced now.
