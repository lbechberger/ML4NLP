The animated television show, The Simpsons, has been taken off Venezuelan television after claims that the programme is "inappropriate" for children. A regulator in Venezuela said that, by airing the program, the network broadcasting The Simpsons, Televen, "were infringing many things in the television and radio social responsibility law."

The American drama series Baywatch Hawaii, which stopped airing in the United Stated in 2001, is being aired as a replacement to the animated series. Baywatch is about the lives of fictional lifeguards in the county of Los Angeles.

According to the CIA's The World Factbook, Venezuela has a total of 111 television channels. It is claimed in the factbook, however, that 45 of these are repeater channels.

The website of Televen describes the animated series, which it will soon stop airing, as a "famous family," which has won "several awards."
