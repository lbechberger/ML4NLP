Seventeen people in Guatemala have been killed by Tropical Storm Dolly, the fourth storm of the 2008 Atlantic hurricane season. This included twelve people from a family from Zacapa, who died when a hill collapsed on their home. 

The home collapse in Zapaca killed all but three of the people who were in the home at the time of the collapse. Nine children were among those who died.

In Huehuetenango, a landslide killed all four people inside a house.

Angel Antonio Diaz, another person who died, drowned while attempting to cross the river PunilÃ¡.

The Guatemalan National Institute of Seismology, Volcanology, Meteorology and Hydrology (INSIVUMEH) said that the storms will continue throughout the rest of today and tomorrow. According to INSIVUMEH, most of Guatemala will continue to experience winds and rain, and the Pacific coast will experience thunderstorms.
