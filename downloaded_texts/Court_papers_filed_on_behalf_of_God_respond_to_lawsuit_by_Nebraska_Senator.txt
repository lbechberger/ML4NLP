Two court filings in response to a lawsuit brought by Nebraska State Senator Ernie Chambers were filed on behalf of God, according to John Friend, clerk of the Douglas County District Court in Omaha, Nebraska. 

"This one miraculously appeared on the counter. It just all of a sudden was here -- poof!" said Mr. Friend. In one filing, St. Michael the Archangel is listed as a witness.

The response argues that the defendant is not subject to the jurisdiction and laws of the court. According to the response read by Friend, God said, "I created man and woman with free will and next to the promise of immortal life, free will is my greatest gift to you."

Reports say that the papers were filed by "King Cobra", a lawmaker in Nebraska.

Chambers had sued God for "widespread death, destruction and terrorization of millions upon millions of the Earth's inhabitants." Chambers, an agnostic, argues that his lawsuit is "frivolous" and "anybody can sue anybody."
