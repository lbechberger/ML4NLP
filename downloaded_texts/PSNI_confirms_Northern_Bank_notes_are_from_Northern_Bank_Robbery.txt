The Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) has confirmed that the £50,000 found earlier today in a leisure complex building was from Northern Bank Robbery. The leisure centre is used by serving and retired PSNI officers on the outskirts of Belfast and the find is believed by the police to be an attempt to distract them from the money laundering investigation currently taking place.

Meanwhile, it is likely that the £60,000 seized at a house in County Cork on Wednesday night is to be confirmed as having also come from the Northern Bank raid.
