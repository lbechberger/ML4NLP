This weekend saw the opening of two new exhibitions at Edinburgh's National Gallery of Modern Art. Wikinews attended Thursday's press preview for the event where a full contingent of the capital's press turned out to see the striking collection of paintings, photographs, and other works. Presented below are a selection of images captured at the preview.

REFLECTIONS: A Series of Changing Displays of Contemporary Art, billed as a showcase of a "diverse range of internationally-renowned contemporary and modern artists" is to display major works from the Gallery's permanent collection, alongside important loans. Alongside this broad range of works, a three-room display of pieces on-loan from the Roy Lichtenstein Foundation — with a dramatic painted steel relief, 'borrowed' from the Tate in London — runs from March 14 through to January 10 next year.

Admission to both exhibitions is free; being located in Dean, to the north-west of Edinburgh's city centre, a free Gallery bus service is available.
