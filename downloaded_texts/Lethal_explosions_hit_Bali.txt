Several explosions hit popular tourist destination areas in Kuta Beach, Indonesia early today, killing at least 19 people and injuring 100 others. Between 11:50 and 12:00 UTC, three explosions hit the Kuta Square and Jimbaran Beach, two popular Western tourist areas in Bali.

The Indonesian national news agency, ANTARA, reported that the first two explosions occurred at 6:50 p.m. local time, near a Jimbaran food court and the third blast at 7:00 p.m. in Kuta Town Square. Other reports claim that the blasts occurred at around 7:15 p.m. The two major blasts are thought to have struck a crowded main square at central Kuta, and the other in a cafe on Jimbaran beach, near the Four Seasons Hotel, areas which are generally popular with Western tourists. At this time, it is not clear how many explosions were involved; however, 4 blasts have been reported. 

The bombings occurred just two days before the start of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan and 11 days before the third anniversary of the 2002 Bali bombing.
