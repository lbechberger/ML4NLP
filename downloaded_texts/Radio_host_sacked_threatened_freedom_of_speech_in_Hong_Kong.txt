A Hong Kong radio host Wong Yuk Man has been sacked last week. Wong hosted a radio program which had helped him become famous by criticizing the government and the pro-Beijing political party. Commercial Radio, a private radio station and Wongâ€™s former employee said Wong was fired because he demanded a 5-days-per-week program which the station could not deliver. However, Wong said he was fired because commercial radio station feared that the government would refuse to renew their license because of his outspoken criticism against the government. The 5 days per week program which Wong hosted had been cancelled and Wong was reallocated to host a weekly program a couple of months ago after Chen King-Hon, another outspoken radio host of commercial radio who was the most popular host at the time, was sacked and his program cancelled.

Wong and Chen, and their former co-hosts had organized 5,000 fans to join their candle night rally in Central, protesting against the alleged collusion between the commercial radio station and the government and urged for freedom of speech in Hong Kong. Donald Tsang, Hong Kong new Chief Executive, who has just replaced the unpopular Tung Chee-Hwa a month ago who had failed to finish his second term due to the alleged health problem, was criticized for restricting the freedom of speech in Hong Kong. Tsang has not yet responded to their criticism.
