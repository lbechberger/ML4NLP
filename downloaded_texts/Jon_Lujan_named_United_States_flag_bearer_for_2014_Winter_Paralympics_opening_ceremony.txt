Sochi, Russia â€” Yesterday, Jon Lujan of Littleton, Colorado was named the United States flag bearer for the 2014 Winter Paralympics opening ceremony scheduled to take place tomorrow in Sochi, Russia. Lujan is a United States Marine Corps veteran, and will be competing in the alpine events at this year's Games.

In Sochi, Lujan is rooming with Heath Calhoun, the 2010 Winter Paralympics United States flag bearer. Like Lujan, Calhoun is also a veteran, having served in the army.

In 2003, while serving in Iraq, Lujan ruptured two discs in his back. Following a back surgery in 2005 that attempted to fix the discs, he had complications that resulted in permanent nerve damage and paralysis in his lower legs. 

Also yesterday, wheelchair curler Sonja Gaudet was named the flag bearer of the Canadian delegation. 

Earlier today, skier Millie Knight was selected as the flagbearer for Great Britain. At 15 years of age, Knight is the youngest member of Team GB.
