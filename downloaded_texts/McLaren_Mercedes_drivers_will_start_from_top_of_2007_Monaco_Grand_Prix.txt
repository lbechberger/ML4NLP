McLaren Mercedes drivers Fernando Alonso and Lewis Hamilton will start from top of FIA Formula-1 2007 Monaco Grand Prix at the Circuit de Monaco in Monte Carlo. During the first qualifying session Alonso stayed in the shadow of his young companion, but in second and third he showed his true potential and won the pole for tomorrow.

During the early free practice Adrian Sutil, driving for Spyker-Ferrari, overcameKimi Räikkönen on the wet but drying track by 0.127 s to lead that session. He was unable to compete on that level in qualification though.

Kimi himself surprised the spectators by stopping his Ferrari car in the Rascasse corner just like Michael Schumacher did last year. Though he restarted his engine and drove to the pits, he was out prior to the Q3 session. Felipe Massa became the only Red driver to battle for pole, conquering the third position.
