Last week, Cypriot authorities released British soldier Allan Ford from a prison in Cyprus despite protests from Danish authorities. Allan Ford was one of three British soldiers serving life sentences for the brutal murder of 23-year-old Dane Louise Jensen, a tourist guide. Still serving, are fellow soldiers Justin Fowler and Geoff Pernell. Jensen's family and Danish authorities appealed Cyprus to reconsider the decision but it was in vain.

In 1994, after a drinking binge, the three soldiers came upon Louise Jensen and her boyfriend, who were on motorcycle. With their jeep, the soldiers struck the pair and abducted Jensen. They then sexually abused her and killed her with strikes to the head from a spade.

Allan Ford, Justin Fowler and Geoff Pernell were subsequently convicted to life in prison and discharged from the military. In 1998, the sentence was reduced to 25 years after an appeal case. Now, after serving 12 years the Cypriotic authorities have decided to release them with time off for good behavior and remission. To avoid a public outrage similar to that of 1994, the three will be released separately. Allan Ford was released last week and quietly spirited away to the United Kingdom. Justin Fowler and Geoff Pernell are scheduled to be released later this month.
