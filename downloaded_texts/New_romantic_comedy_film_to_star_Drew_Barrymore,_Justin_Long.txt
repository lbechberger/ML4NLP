Drew Barrymore and Justin Long have been cast in a romantic comedy called Going the Distance.

The New Line Cinema film is to be directed by documentary filmmaker Nanette Burstein, who made the films The Kid Stays in the Picture and American Teen. It will be Burstein's feature film debut.

Going the Distance, written by New Line staffer Geoff LaTulippe, will focus on a couple dealing with challenges arising from a cross-country romance. Media reports did not indicate a release date had been determined.

The film is being produced by Adam Shankman and Jennifer Gibgot via their independent production company, Offspring Entertainment.

Barrymore and Long last appeared together in the 2009 film, He's Just Not That into You, which grossed $145 million worldwide. The duo dated in real life, but broke up in July after dating for about a year.
