The United States and England opened their 2010 FIFA World Cup campaigns on Saturday with a 1–1 draw in front of a crowd of over 38,000 at Royal Bafokeng Stadium in Rustenburg, South Africa.

England captain Steven Gerrard put the English in front early with his goal in the fourth minute. The goal came as Gerrard was able to slip in behind the U.S. defense in the middle of the penalty box. The United States equalized in the 40th minute off a long-distance shot by midfielder Clint Dempsey. The shot, from roughly 25 yards from goal, seemed like an easy stop until it bounced off English goalkeeper Robert Green and in for a goal. Both teams had several chances to earn the go-ahead goal in the second half, including a shot by Jozy Altidore that was deflected by Green and bounced off the goal post. A couple of saves by U.S. goalkeeper Tim Howard also played a large role in the second half.

The draw means both teams earn one point from the match which temporarily placed them in first place in Group C. Both teams play their second game of the World Cup on June 18 when the United States will face Slovenia followed by England playing Algeria.

Other 2010 FIFA World Cup action on Saturday saw Korean Republic get off to a strong start defeating Greece 2–0, while Argentina blanked Nigeria 1–0.

On Sunday the first round of games in Group C concludes when Algeria and Slovenia face off. All four Group D teams will also be in action with Serbia taking on Ghana and Germany facing Australia.
