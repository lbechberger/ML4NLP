Microsoft, along with MetroFi, are set to construct a community wide Wi-Fi network in Portland, Oregon. Craig Mathias, founder of Farpoint Group, believes that one day Wi-Fi will offer a viable alternative to Cable and DSL. 

"I think muni Wi-Fi will become enormous," said Mathias.

Currently 68 cities in the United States have city wide Wi-Fi with 132 more planning deployments.
