Casey Stoner has won the 2011 British MotoGP placing him at the top of the championship table. The Australian rider started in pole position and finished 15.159 seconds ahead of second place Andrea Dovizioso. American Colin Edwards claimed third place despite riding with a broken collarbone.

The win at Silverstone gives Stoner his forth win of the season and places him ahead of previous championship leader Jorge Lorenzo, who crashed out during the race. Marco Simoncelli and Ben Spies also failed to finish the race after suffering crashes. The race was affected by bad driving conditions due to heavy rain but a large crowd still attended despite no British riders taking part in the MotoGP.

Speaking to the BBC after his victory Stoner said "At the beginning we didn't get a great start. But the bike felt good, and I waited for the tyres to get up to temperature. In the first lap I had water in my visor, so for the first five or six laps I couldn't really see properly. I couldn't see any puddles. But finally the water went away and I was able to do the lap times I wanted, and open up a gap."

German riders Stefan Bradl and Jonas Folger won the Moto2 and 125cc classification races.
