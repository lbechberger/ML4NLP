Former Australian cricketer, Dean Jones was sacked by Ten Sports after he called South African batsman Hashim Amla a "terrorist" on air.

Jones, who was a commentator for Ten Sports said "The terrorist has got another wicket.", in reference to Amla (a practising Muslim who sports a long beard) when the latter dismissed Sri Lankan batsman Kumar Sangakkara during yesterday's match at Colombo.

Gerald Majola, the chief executive of Cricket South Africa, said that Supersport as well as Cricket South Africa had received several angry calls in response to Jones' comment. Shortly after Majola's statement, the Australian was spotted at Colombo airport where he clarified that he was "gone". Dean Jones also admitted that his comment was "silly" and "insensitive" and that "it was never meant to be heard on air". He apologised to those offended by his comment and said that he had not intended to be disrespectful.
