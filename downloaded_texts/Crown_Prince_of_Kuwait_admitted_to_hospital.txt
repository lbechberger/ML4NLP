Crown Prince of Kuwait Sheikh Saad al-Abdulla al-Sabah, was admitted to a hospital on Thursday due to a blood condition. According to the state news agency KUNA he has been suffering from a high level of blood glucose. In 1997 Sheikh Saad underwent colon surgery. 

Sheikh Saad has been crown prince since 1978. He was also prime minister until July 2003. In July 2003 the Emir replaced him with Sheik Sabah as prime minister. This appointment broke the tradition of crown princes also serving as heads of government. Both he and the Emir have made very few public appearances recently.
