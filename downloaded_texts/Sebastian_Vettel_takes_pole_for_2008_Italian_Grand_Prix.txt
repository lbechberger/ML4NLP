Scuderia Toro Rosso–Ferrari driver Sebastian Vettel won the pole position for the Sunday FIA Formula One 2008 Gran Premio Santander d'Italia race at Autodromo Nazionale Monza, Italy.

The track was wet during most of the Friday practice sessions and all the qualification triplet, a rare event for the Formula One at Monza. Heavy rain conditions on the racing circuit caused a couple of surprises for the spectators.

First was the major defeat of Kimi Räikkönen (Ferrari) and Lewis Hamilton (McLaren-Mercedes), two major competitors in the Drivers' Championship. They totally lost the second qualifying session and will start 14th and 15th in the tomorrow race. This was accompanied by Vettel setting the best time in the session of 1:35.837.

The German driver repeatedly set the best time in the final session. His pole position was endangered by Felipe Massa, but the second Ferrari driver came only 6th in his final attempt and Heikki Kovalainen, Hamilton's teammate in McLaren, made better progress netting second position just before the chequered flag closed the session.
