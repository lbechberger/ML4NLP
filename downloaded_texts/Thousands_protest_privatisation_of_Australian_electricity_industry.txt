In New South Wales today, thousands of people joined a protest including 15 Labor Members of Parliament about the State Government's plans to privatise the electricity industry.

The MPs included Paul Gibson, Upper House president Peter Primrose, and former MPs Kerry Hickey and Grant McBride.

Mr Gibson was reported as saying, "I'm a member of the Australian Labor Party and I'm sticking to the Labor platform and policy."

The Government seems to have ignored the positions of the protesters, with Premier Morris Iemma expressing to the first sitting of Parliament for 2008 that his Government's plans would proceed.
