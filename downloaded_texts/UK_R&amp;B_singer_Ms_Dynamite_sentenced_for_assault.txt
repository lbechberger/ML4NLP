The UK musician, Niomi McLean-Daley popularly known as 'Ms Dynamite' has been sentenced to carry out 60 hours of community service after admitting to assaulting a policewoman.

The rap star has been fined Â£750 in compensation.

Sky News reports that "she had hit the officer in the face at a London police station on January 6."

According to Sky News, District Judge Timothy Workman said: "The injury sustained by that one blow were obviously more considerable than first thought.

"I accept that it was one blow and in the circumstances bearing in mind your good character, you have never been in court before, you are entitled to a discount on sentence."

According to her solicitor the catalyst for the row was the racial abuse of her sister Annabell, 18.

The BBC reports that Ms Dynamite's solicitor Anthony Burton said: "My client has absolutely no excuse for her conduct. She makes no bones about that. 

She apologises profoundly for her conduct to the officer involved, Pc Marles. "She is deeply ashamed."
