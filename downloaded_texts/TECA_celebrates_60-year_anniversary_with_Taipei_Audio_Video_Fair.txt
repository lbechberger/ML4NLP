The 28th Taipei Audio Video Fair (TAVF), organized by the Taipei Electrical Commercial Association (TECA), featured not only some innovative domestic market exhibition ideas, but also offered a pavilion entitled the "Global Audio and Video History Corridor", to showcase the audio and video industry's world-wide history. Wikinews reporter Rico Shen attended the fair, which, this year, highlighted TECA's 60th anniversary.

At the Taipei Grand Hotel (Yuanshan Hall), some participants (exhibitors) rented soundproof guest rooms, which offered the best quality and performance for audio experiences. With high-definition television becoming a popular topic, some pre-market or marketed wide-screen HDTVs featuring 1080p were exhibited at the Taipei World Trade Center (TWTC Hall).

The TAVF show runs from November 8 to 12, closing at 8:00 p.m. (Taipei Time) each night except November 12, which has a closing time of 6 p.m. To assist visitors from The Grand Hotel, TWTC and TECA hired the Metropolitan Transport Corporation for an inter-hall shuttle service. The peak number of visitors are expected to be on the weekend after permitting minors under 120 cm to enter the showground.
