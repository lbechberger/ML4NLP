The President of Brazil, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva is facing a serious political crisis in his government. There are a lot of denounciations involving important figures of his party, the Workers’ Party (PT). 

In an attempt to save his government, Lula is negotiating an alliance with the Party of the Brazilian Democratic Movement (PMDB). Lula said that he will reform his ministry and it is expected that some politicians of the PMDB become ministers.
There is not a general consensus about this alliance. Some governors and parliamentarians of PMDB are against it. 

The President of PMDB, Michel Temer, said that he will listen to his colleagues before taking a decision.
