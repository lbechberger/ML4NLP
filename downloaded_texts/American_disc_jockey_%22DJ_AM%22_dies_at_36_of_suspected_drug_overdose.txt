The American celebrity disc jockey Adam "DJ AM" Goldstein has been found dead in his apartment in Manhattan, New York. The cause of death is suspected to be a drug overdose. Goldstein was found dead by paramedics at 5:20 pm. Drug paraphernalia was found at his apartment, but the star had claimed to be clean for years after an addiction to crack cocaine. 

Goldstein was a disc jockey at some of Hollywood's most exclusive clubs and parties. He became a celebrity in his own right after relationships with actress Mandy Moore and the daughter of Lionel Richie, Nicole. 

The disc jockey escaped death in September 2008 after he was involved in a plane crash that killed four people. Former drummer for rock band Blink-182, Travis Barker was also injured in the plane crash. 

Several members of the Hollywood community released statements about Goldstein's death. Television host Maria Menounos said "So horrible. In shock" and blogger Perez Hilton wrote on his Twitter page saying "He survived a deadly plane crash and now THIS, I can't stop crying".
