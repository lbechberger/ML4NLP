Janez Janša, the Prime Minister of Slovenia, will again serve as the President of the Slovenian Democratic Party (SDS) after he was reelected in a party congress held in Portorož Saturday. Janša has been the leader of SDS since 1993.

The 8th Congress was held under a slogan: "Slovenian Democratic Party - Slovenia on a new road." Out of 450 delegates, 368 voted for Janša and 3 ballots were void. There were no votes against.

The delegates also voted on proposed changes to SDS statute, with overwhelming consensus. New members will no longer be obliged to present proof that they had not cooperated with the secret service of the "totalitarian regime" prior to 1990, when Slovenia declared independence from Yugoslavia.

Delegates reached an agreement that the new political program of the party should reflect current economic conditions, as well as aim at increased growth of the country's economy.
