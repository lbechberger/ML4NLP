Recently, record breaking rainfall has doled out severe destruction over much of the state of Texas, United States. The state's governor called the effects of the storms "absolutely devastating". At least two people died over the weekend, while twelve more were reported missing. 

Various rainfall records have been broken all over the state in recent days. On Sunday alone, over three inches of rain fell in the city of Dallas. In Hays County, one official described the flooding as "the largest flood in the history of this region" â€” at least 350 homes there were destroyed and an additional 1,000 homes suffered damage.

While both Oklahoma and Mexico have seen effects of the storms, the two killed in Texas were a girl returning from her prom and a 14 year-old boy. A photo from The Weather Channel showed flooding at The Galleria shopping mall in Houston, preventing employees from leaving. In the eastern part of the state, heavy rains have struck nearly every day in May, washing out patches of roadways.
