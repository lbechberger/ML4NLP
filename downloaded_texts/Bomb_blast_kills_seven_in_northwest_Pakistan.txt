Officials in Pakistan have said that a bomb blast killed seven Pakistani soldiers and wounded eleven others on Saturday in the northwestern part of the country. The incident took place in the Khyber region, which is the main route for moving supplies to international forces fighting in neighbouring Afghanistan.

The explosion struck a vehicle that was transporting paramilitary troops on a patrol near the region's main town of Landikotal, according to a spokesman for the Frontier Corps. "The vehicle was completely destroyed and seven of our soldiers were killed," the spokesman said.

Pakistani armed forces started an operation against militants in the Khyber region in September, saying that the rebels had started to expand their activities. The mountainous area along the Afghanistan border is said to be haven for both al-Qaeda and Taliban insurgents.

The violence comes a day after US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton ended her visit to the country.
