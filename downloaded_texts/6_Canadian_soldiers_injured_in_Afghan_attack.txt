Six soldiers were injured, Tuesday, during a mortar attack on a Canadian outpost in Afghanistan. None of the injuries sustained are life threatening, according to officials. 

One soldier was treated on base while five others were flown to a military hospital in Kandahar. Two of the soldiers are being kept for observation, the others were treated and released. 

The attack occurred at Forward Operating Base Wilson which is about 30 kilometres west of Kandahar in Zhari District Centre, an area that has been the target of recent Taliban attacks. 
Canadian Press reports that according to its sources Taliban fighters from across southern Afghanistan have gathered in the area within the past 24 hours, preparing for battle with NATO and Afghan government forces.
