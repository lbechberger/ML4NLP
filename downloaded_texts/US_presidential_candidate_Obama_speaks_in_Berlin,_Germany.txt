United States Presidential hopeful Barack Obama, spoke to over 200,000 last Thursday in Berlin, Germany at Tiergarten Park. His speech was focused on building a stronger connection with Germany and Europe. Obama also called for German troops to be deployed to Afghanistan, and for greater German participation in international crises. 

The speech was received very well in Germany and back in the United States. The German newspaper Bild stated that "unlike George W. Bush, [Obama] wants to do this in cooperation with others, especially Europe."

The National Reviews Jim Geraghty commended Obama on pushing Germany for more help in Afghanistan: "If Barack Obama can convince the Germans to contribute more to the mission in Afghanistan, God bless him, I mean that." Germany's own Der Tagesspiegel commented that the speech "was the signal of a new era for a new generation on both sides of the Atlantic."

The McCain campaign said that the speech was "eloquent praise for this country." However McCain spokesman Tucker Bounds also said that "while Barack Obama took a premature victory lap today in the heart of Berlin, proclaiming himself a 'citizen of the world,' John McCain continued to make his case to the American citizens who will decide this election."

Barack Obama arrived in Berlin on July 24. His stop in Berlin was part of his Middle East/European tour that he has conducted to shore up his foreign relations record. Friday, Obama continued on to Paris, France.
