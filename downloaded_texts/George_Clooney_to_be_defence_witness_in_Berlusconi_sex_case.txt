Silvio Berlusconi, the Prime Minister of Italy, has announced he will call US actor George Clooney to testify at his trial.

Berlusconi is accused of having sex with an underage prostitute, Karima El Mahroug, during a party at his villa near Milan. He has denies the charges. The Italian PM is further accused of abusing his power by intervening in a theft that Ms. Mahroug was involved in. Berlusconi attempted to evade the charges by using a recently overturned law that would leave him immune to prosecution.

Mr. Clooney and his partner, Elisabetta Canalis, were said to have been present during the February 14, 2010 party at Mr. Berlusconi's villa.

The trial is expected to begin on April 6th.
