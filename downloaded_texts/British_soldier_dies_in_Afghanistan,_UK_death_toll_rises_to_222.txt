A British soldier has been killed in Afghanistan, taking the number of British deaths there since 2001 to 222.

He was a member of the Royal Military Police, and was killed while on foot patrol in the Helmand province, close to the Gereshk district in Southern Afghanistan. The cause of death has been reported to be an explosion, but the source is unclear.

"It is my sad duty to confirm the death of a soldier, a Royal Military Policeman, in an explosion earlier today in Helmand Province," Lieutenant Colonel David Wakefield said of the incident. " He died doing his duty and we will remember him."

The deceased's family has been informed.
