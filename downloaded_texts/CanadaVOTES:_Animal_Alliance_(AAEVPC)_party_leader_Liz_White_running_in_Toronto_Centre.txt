On October 14, 2008, Canadians will be heading to the polls for the federal election. Animal Alliance Environment Voters Party of Canada leader Liz White is standing for election in the riding of Toronto Centre.

Once the director of the Toronto Humane Society, she has been with the Animal Alliance Canada organization since the 1980s. She is currently a full time staff member and Director, working on legislative and media matters, as well as fundraising. According to her biography on their website, "her primary issues include Municipal Animal Control by-law matters, endangered species legislation and hunting issues." White herself is a vegetarian and advocates a vegetarian lifestyle.

Wikinews contacted Liz, to talk about the issues facing Canadians, and what they and their party would do to address them. Wikinews is in the process of contacting every candidate, in every riding across the country, no matter their political stripe. All interviews are conducted via e-mail, and interviews are published unedited, allowing candidates to impart their full message to our readers, uninterrupted.

This is the first election that the party is running multiple candidates; in the 2006 federal election, only Ms. White was listed.

Riding incumbent and prominent Liberal Bob Rae, once the NDP premier of Ontario, is defending the riding versus many candidates. Beside Liz White, they are El-Farouk Khaki (NDP), Ellen Michelson (Green), David Gentili (Conservative), Johan Boyden (Communist), Philip Fernandez (Marxist-Leninist), and independent Gerald Derome.
