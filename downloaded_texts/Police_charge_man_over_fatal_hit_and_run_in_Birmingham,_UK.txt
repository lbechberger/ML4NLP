In the United Kingdom, West Midlands Police charged a 26-year-old man with causing death by dangerous driving after an 80-year-old woman died following a hit and run incident in the Yardley area of the city of Birmingham. The man's court appearance was scheduled for today.

The woman was hit at approximately 11:30am GMT Saturday while attempting to cross the street on Coventry Road. According to Claire Thomas, speaking on behalf of the West Midlands Ambulance Service, when paramedics arrived at the incident scene they found she had "multiple serious injuries and was in cardiac arrest". They performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) on the woman but "despite their best efforts, nothing could be done", Thomas recounted, and the woman was pronounced dead. As of Sunday evening, the woman had not yet been publicly identified, although police had told her family about her death.

The driver of the vehicle that hit her failed to stop at the scene, according to police. Police said they subsequently discovered a car about six miles from the scene, in the town of Solihull, which they believe is the vehicle used in the incident. The alleged driver of the car turned himself in and was arrested at the police station in the Stechford area of Birmingham.
