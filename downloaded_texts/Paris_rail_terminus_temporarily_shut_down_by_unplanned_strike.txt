Services were slowly restored after an unscheduled strike by SNCF drivers closed one of Paris's six main railway stations.

Gare Saint-Lazare was closed from 10 am local time on Tuesday morning.
Members of the Sud Rail labour union later voted to return to work, and the station re-opened at 7 pm the same day.

Gare Saint-Lazare is Europe's third busiest station, and its lines serve Paris suburbs, as well as inter-city routes to Normandy in northern France.
