A string of at least three explosions in Egyptian resort towns in the Sinai early Saturday morning has left at least 88 people dead and over 200 more wounded.

One blast occurred at 1am in Sharm el-Sheikh, apparently in the market area, and two others about 15 minutes later in Naama Bay, a nearby resort. The explosions reportedly occurred outside hotels. A witness told the AP that the four-star hotel Ghazala Gardens has "completely burned down".

In October of last year, 34 people were killed in explosions in Taba and Ras Shitan, nearby resort areas popular with Israeli tourists. Due to this, officials blamed those attacks on violence related to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
