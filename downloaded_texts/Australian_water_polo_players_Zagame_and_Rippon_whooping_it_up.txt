Earlier today, the Australian Institute of Sport and Swimming Australia cancelled a team meeting for the Australian Stingers and a Swimming Australia Grand Prix event scheduled for this weekend after two Olympic bound water polo players, Melissa Rippon and Nicola Zagame, were diagnosed with whooping cough.

Both players are receiving treatment administered by the Australian Institute of Sport. Meanwhile, their teammates are in quarantine. In a statement issued by Water Polo Australia, they said "Water Polo Australia is taking this very seriously and will continue to work closely with AIS health professionals to provide the best care for those players diagnosed and to reduce any potential further risk".

For Australia's Olympic bound swimmers, their coaches are expected to arrange alternative training ahead of their leaving for Europe. In a statement released by Olympic swimming head coach Leigh Nugent, he said, "Originally we'd planned to have this camp as an opportunity to come together for some further relay preparation and the chance for some of the athletes to race and time trial, a month or so out from the Games. From a relay perspective we are confident we're on track with our preparations and will fine-tune things when we get to Manchester in July."

Rippon and Zagame are expected to be recovered next week and should be ready for London.
