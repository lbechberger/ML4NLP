Romanian mobile telephony giant Connex, recently bought by Vodafone, announced the company is planning to introduce 3G services and video telephony. Romanian cities effected by the change are: Bucharest, Cluj-Napoca, Timişoara, Braşov, Constanţa, Ploieşti, Craiova and Iaşi. The only 3G-enabled model currently sold by Connex is the Nokia 6630.

Ken Campbell, chief marketing officer of Connex, said he expects the 3G introduction to be successful, given the Romanian interest in video telephony services. Connex's 3G technology will also provide a permanent connection to the Internet, access to multimedia content, live video streaming and video conferencing. The network also provides mobile broadband speeds of up to 384 kbps.

Connex is currently the second-largest mobile telephony company in Romania, with nearly five million customers. It is one of Romanian's best recognised companies.
