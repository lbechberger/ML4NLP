Dr. Peter Piot, head of U.N. AIDS agency, told The Associated Press on the sidelines of a regional AIDS conference Sunday about the potential for an explosion in HIV and AIDS cases in the country of Papua New Guinea. He said the country is "the one that I would see that could have an African-type of epidemic" and that the danger of HIV and AIDS there "is really getting out of hand." He also said other Asia-Pacific nations like Malaysia, Vietnam and Myanmar are also worrisome as the number of infections there continue to rise.
