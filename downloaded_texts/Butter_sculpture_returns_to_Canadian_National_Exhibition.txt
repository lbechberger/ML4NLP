After not having the novel attraction of butter sculptures since the mid-1990s, the Canadian National Exhibition has revived the tradition in a limited fashion.

In the past, farming exhibits have displayed elaborate, lifesize sculptures of celebrities, animals, and objects at "the Ex". Many best recall the sculpture of The Beatles, created in the 1970s.

For their current exhibit however, the sculptures are relatively small. None of the sculptures created as of Sunday, August 21 were over two feet tall, and cramped sculpting facilities did not appear to encourage such larger endeavours. Sculptures included a caricatured cowboy with large pants, a deer, and a woman's face, neck and shoulders.

The sign promoting the attraction bills the event as Butter Sculpture "Artists" suggesting the organizers question the artistic merit of unusual mediums. Butter sculpture is a popular attraction at many fairs across North America.

The exhibit continues until the end of the CNE on Labour Day, in the Automotive Building's "Farm, Food and Fun" displays. According to the CNE's official website, the sculptures are being created by students from the Ontario College of Art.
