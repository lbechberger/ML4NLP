Tony Blair, former prime minister of the United Kingdom, appeared before the Iraq Inquiry today. He faced six hours of questioning, starting at 6:30 am, at the Queen Elizabeth II Conference Centre in London concerning his role in the 2003 Iraq invasion. During the inquiry, Blair stood by his decision to invade, saying he would make the same decision again.

This is the third time Blair has given evidence at an inquiry into the Iraq War, having already testified before the Hutton Inquiry and the Butler Review, as well as participating in an investigation by the Intelligence and Security Committee. The Hutton Inquiry found that the government did not "sex up" the dossier on Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. The Butler Review uncovered "serious flaws" in pre-war intelligence, and this inquiry was set up by current prime minister Gordon Brown in order to "learn the lessons" of the war. Sir John Chilcott, the inquiry chairman, began by stressing that Blair was not "on trial", but could be called back to give further evidence if necessary.

At the end of the session, Chilcott asked Blair if he had any regrets, to which Blair replied that he was "sorry" that it was "divisive", but said that invading was the right thing to do since he believes "the world is a safer place as a result." Blair said that the inquiry should ask the "2010 question", which refers to the hypothetical position that the world would be in if Saddam Hussein were not removed from power. He said that "today we would have a situation where Iraq was competing with Iran [...] in respect of support of terrorist groups".
