A fast, but potent, snowstorm passing through the United States state of Colorado dropped more than a foot of snow and caused a 35-car pile-up on one of the U.S.'s major highways, Interstate 70. 

The collision happened Saturday morning when white-out conditions, caused by 68 MPH sustained winds, hit the area. Despite the pileup, officials report that there were no major injuries. 

Interstate 70 was closed in both directions on Saturday, on a route from Denver to the Kansas state border, according to the Colorado Department of Transportation. The storm also forced the closure of 125 miles of highway on Interstate 80. 

A blizzard warning remained in effect for parts of Kansas and Nebraska.
