Grand Ayatollah Ali Khamenei ruled out any talks with Washington because of "America's bullying." His remarks come after the United States denounced Iran for supporting terrorism.

Khamenei also expressed support for an oil embargo of Israel and its allies saying, "A one-month oil embargo is a principled and serious issue," to back the Palestinian Intifada (uprising). Additionally, he praised Palestinians who conduct martyrdom operations in the occupied territories, 

Grand Ayatollah Khamenei was recently featured in the Chinese magazine Global People (环球人物), which named the Leader of the Islamic Revolution as the only world leader who has confronted the United States.

Khamenei has in the past criticized the U.S. for trying to create conflict in the Middle East; in a 2005 statement, he said, "All Muslim nations, particularly the people of Iraq, Pakistan and Afghanistan, must promote their unity and solidarity and be aware of the plots of the enemies of Islam to foment discord among them." After Iran was dubbed an element of the "Axis of Evil", Tehran called Washington "the enemy of Islam."
