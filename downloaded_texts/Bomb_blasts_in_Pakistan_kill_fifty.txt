Bombings in two Pakistani cities killed about 50 people and wounded more than 140 others on Monday, according to authorities.

Authorities in the northeastern city of Lahore, the capital of the Punjab province, stated that twin bombings devastated a busy market crowded with women and children, killing some 40 people. They say more than 100 people were wounded in the two explosions that occurred about 30 seconds apart. The detonation started a fire, which spread quickly due to the many wooden stalls in the market.

Hours earlier, a suicide bomber killed ten people and wounded more than 40 others in Peshawar, the capital of Northwest Frontier Province that has been repeatedly hit by bombings in recent months. Local authorities say the bomber blew himself up as he was stopped by security guards outside a courthouse.

There have been no claims of responsibility for any of the attacks.
