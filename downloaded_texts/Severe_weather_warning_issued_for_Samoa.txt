The Fiji Meteorological Service issued a severe weather warning for Samoa at 0835 UTC today. Forecasters are predicting damaging gale force winds, heavy rain, squally thunderstoms and heavy seas that may cause the flooding of low-lying land in the South Pacific island of Samoa within the next 24 to 36 hours.

The intensifying tropical cyclone Olaf is following in the footsteps of cyclone Nancy and the two storms are expected to interact in some way over the next 3 to 4 days. Some predictions indicate the two storms may merge.
