National Basketball Association (NBA) free agents Chris Bosh and Dwyane Wade will sign with the Miami Heat, the pair announced yesterday. 

ESPN first reported the decision early yesterday. The players confirmed the deal in the afternoon with a joint appearance on the network. The Miami Heat did not comment per NBA rules which prevented teams from discussing contracts prior to Thursday at 12:01 a.m. (ET), at which point contracts may be signed. 

Bosh, a power forward, comes to the Heat after playing the first seven years of his career with the Toronto Raptors. It is still unclear whether Bosh will sign a contract outright with the Heat, or if he will sign with the Raptors then be traded to the Heat. Raptors and Heat officials are attempting to negotiate a sign-and-trade deal which will allow the Raptors to receive players or draft picks for losing Bosh, and will allow Bosh to receive as much as $25 million more in a contract.

Wade, a point guard, returns to the Heat, the team where he has played his entire NBA career. Wade was considering a move to the Chicago Bulls, but in the end decided to stay in Miami. He told ESPN, "It became the best decision for me, especially when Chris said he wanted to come down."

Both men feel that this situation will give them the best opportunity to win NBA titles. Said Bosh, "It's not about the money. It's not about anything else except for winning. I'm a winner. Dwyane's a winner. We're going to bring winning to Miami."
