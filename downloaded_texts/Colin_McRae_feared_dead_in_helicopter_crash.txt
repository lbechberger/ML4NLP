An AS350B2 helicopter registered to former champion World Rally Championship driver Colin McRae has crashed near his home in Lanarkshire. Known to be a keen helicopter pilot it has been revealed that McRae was at its controls when it crashed, and burst into flames, killing all aboard.

A police statement said: "Around 1610 BST on Saturday, September 15, 2007, emergency services were called to a helicopter crash in Jerviswood... There are no survivors... There will be no formal identification of anyone on board this evening." The victims were later named by police as Colin McRae (39), his son Johnny (5), the boy's friend Ben Porcelli, and family friend Graeme Duncan (37).

David Richards and his wife survived a helicopter crash in Essex whilst returning from the Formula 1 Belgian Grand Prix, the day after Colin McRae's helicopter crash, who was his former employee.
