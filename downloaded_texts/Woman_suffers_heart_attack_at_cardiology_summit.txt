At the annual European Society of Cardiology Summit in Vienna, Austria, the wife of a cardiologist suffered a heart attack while queueing with her husband to register for the congress.

46-year-old Silvia Celeste from Italy, the wife of Dr. Fabrizio Celeste, collapsed on Sunday and was immediately revived using a defibrillator. The woman was transferred to the general hospital in Vienna, where she was operated upon. She died later that night.

Reinhard Krepler, chief doctor of the hospital, stated that her death was due to an underlying congenital heart disease.

At this year's meeting of the European heart society, some 25,000 cardiologists have gathered. A central topic at the summit is heart attack prevention.
