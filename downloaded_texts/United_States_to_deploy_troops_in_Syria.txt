The United States announced on Friday it will deploy ground troops in Syria in an effort to combat Islamic State (IS). The announcement came as diplomats from seventeen countries met in Vienna to discuss the Syrian crisis. It is the first time in four years external figures and allies to President Bashar al-Assad were in attendance.

Government officials have confirmed "less than 50" special operations forces will be sent to Northern Syria to advise Kurdish and Arab forces. In an address to the media senior administration official Josh Earnest stated, "They will help coordinate local ground forces and coalition efforts to counter ISIL."

This decision to increase it's presence in Syria is the first since the United States deployed airstrikes one year ago. In addition, A-10 ground-attack planes and F-15 tactical fighter jets will be sent to Ä°ncirlik, in Southern Turkey. The Northern Syrian area is currently held by Kurdish forces as they fight IS. Earnest stated "these forces do not have a combat mission", and their role is to aid Kurdish forces with logistics and planning. To date the United States effort to train Arab forces has reportedly been unsuccessful.

A second meeting to further discuss the Syria conflict is set to be held in two weeks.
