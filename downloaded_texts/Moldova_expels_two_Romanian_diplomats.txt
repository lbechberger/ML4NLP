Two diplomats within the Romanian Embassy to Moldova have been declared personae non gratae due to the incompatibility between their activity and the diplomatic status they are holding.

In line with a press statement made by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and European Integration (MFAEI), on Wednesday, December 12, Romanian Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to Moldova Filip Teodorescu was invited to the MFAEI.

"The Foreign Ministry considers such an act as inimical, totally unjustified and incompatible with Romania’s permanent constructive and cooperative attitude towards Moldova," the Romanian Foreign Ministry says in a communiqué releases in reaction...

“I expected many of the problems in our relations to disappear after Romania joined the EU,” said Vladimir Voronin President of Moldova, “but relations between Moldova and Romania have not changed. All those statements are so stupid they don't deserve criticism. Let Europe judge us.”
