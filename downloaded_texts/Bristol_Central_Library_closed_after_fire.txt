The main library in Bristol, United Kingdom has been closed until further notice as a result of a fire which struck the building yesterday morning.

Bristol City Council has reported that it is possible the library will reopen on Tuesday, although it did say that it was likely the building would remain closed on that day. 

The head of Library services at Bristol City Council commented on the incident. She said "we [the Library service] apologise to our customers for this inconvenience but it is not possible to open the library as there remains problem's with power to parts of the building and there is a need to give contractors clear access to clean smoke damage in some public areas. We will review the situation again on Monday morning and issue further updates when further information is available."
