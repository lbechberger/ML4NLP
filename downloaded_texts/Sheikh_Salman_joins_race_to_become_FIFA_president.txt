Asian Football Confederation (AFC) president Sheikh Salman Bin Ibrahim Al Khalifa has declared he will be running for the FIFA presidency after the recent suspension of Sepp Blatter. Sheikh Salman is a member of Bahrain's royal family which has been heavily criticized by multiple human rights activists and organisations in regards to the family's history of abuse and torture of humans who took part in previous pro-democratic demonstrations.

Nicholas McGeehan of the Human Rights Watch said in a statement, "FIFA members should look long and hard at the Al Khalifas' use of torture and allegations that Sheikh Salman failed to protect footballers from abuses, and ask themselves if this is a family they want to represent them at the highest level."

Sheikh Salman's bid for the top job was released by the AFC in the following statement: "Sheikh Salman has assured the AFC Executive Committee, who offered him overwhelming support, and the 47 AFC Member Associations that his campaign will be entirely self-financed and that he will not use the AFC's resources, human or otherwise, in the election."

The 49-year-old's bid comes alongside the UEFA general secretary Gianni Infantino and Liberia Football Association chief Musa Bility in the controversial battle to replace the shamed Blatter.
