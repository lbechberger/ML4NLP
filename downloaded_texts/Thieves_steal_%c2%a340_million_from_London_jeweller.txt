In what police believe is the second-largest heist in Britain, armed robbers stole almost Â£40 million from a London jewellery shop on August 6.



Two men armed with handguns held up employees of the Graff jewellers shop on New Bond Street, taking 43 items, among them expensive watches, bracelets, and rings. The duo escaped in a blue BMW, which they soon abandoned for a Mercedes. After driving to Farm Street, it is believed they may have got away in a third vehicle.

"This was a well planned robbery with a number of vehicles used to help the robbers escape. These men are extremely dangerous and fired at least two shots in busy London streets as they made their getaway," said Detective Chief Inspector Pam Mace.

"Someone knows who these men are, they would undoubtedly have spoken about it beforehand or boasted about it afterwards," she added. "I would urge anyone who recognises them, knows the whereabouts of the jewellery or has any other information to contact us."
