Libyan Prime Minister Abdullah al-Thinni yesterday accused Qatar of interfering in his country's affairs by sending three military planes loaded with weapons to an airport in Tripoli under the control of Islamist rebels.

The Libyan leader told the United Arab Emirates (UAE)-based Arab TV channel Sky News his country would consider "breaking off relations if this interference into Libya's internal affairs continued." He also reiterated previous accusations against Sudan of also trying to supply the rebels.

Last month the US said Egypt and the UAE were involved in airstrikes against militants as they were in the process of capturing Tripoli.

Qatar has previously backed the Muslim Brotherhood, a group reported to have ties with the militants in Tripoli. Other countries, including Egypt and UAE, are reportedly worried about the spread of radical Islam.

Three years after the removal from power of Muammar Gaddafi, Libya now has two competing governments, one in Tripoli, and one in Tobruk where the most recently elected parliament has moved to escape the violence. Rival militias fight each other, and a renegade general is reportedly confronting the Libyan army.
