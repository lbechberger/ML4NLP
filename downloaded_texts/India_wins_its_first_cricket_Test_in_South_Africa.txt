The Indian cricket team has finally won a Test match in South Africa for the first time ever.

Having set the homeside 402 to win, South Africa was all out for 278, India winning by 123 runs and going one-nil up in the three match series.

Paceman Shanthakumaran Sreesanth was one of the heroes for India taking 3/59 after his 5/40 in the first innings. Zaheer Khan picked up 3/79 while leg spinner Anil Kumble finished with 3/54.

Ashwell Prince made a valiant 97 before being second last man out, bowled by Kumble.

It is a great result for captain Rahul Dravid and coach Greg Chappell. The former Australian captain has been criticised in the past week by former Indian greats Sunil Gavaskar and Ravi Shastri.

The Second Test starts on Boxing Day in Durban.
