A politician from Spain's ruling Socialist Party has been killed in Spain's northern Basque region, in the town of Mondragon. The shooting came just two days before general elections in Spain.

IsaÃ­as Carrasco, 42, was shot outside his house in front of his wife and daughter and was taken to hospital, where he died of his wounds. No group has claimed the attack but Spanish sources said the attack was probably carried out by the Basque separatist group, considered as a terrorist group by European Union and United States, ETA.

Spain is in the final day of official campaigning ahead of Sunday's general election, in which the Socialist prime minister Rodriguez Zapatero is seeking a second term. The conservative opposition Partido Popular has focused his campaign in the terrorism and separatism, especially that of the Basque. After the shooting the main parties announced a halt to campaigning. According to the polls, the two parties are neck and neck in the race for the election.
