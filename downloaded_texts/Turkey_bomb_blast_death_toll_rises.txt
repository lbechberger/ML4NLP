On Thursday, September 14, the death toll had risen to 11 adults and 5 children, as a bomb went off in Diyarbakir, Turkey. At least 13 people have been injured in the blasts, some severely.

There are conflicting reports as to who or what group is responsible for the attacks. Yesterday the BBC News agency reported that the Kurdistan Freedom Falcons or TAC had claimed responsibility for the blast, but so far the New Zealand Herald reports that no one has yet to claim responsibility.

VOA News; however, reports that the Turkish Revenge Brigade has claimed responsibility for the blasts.

The Kurdistan Workers Party or PKK, has denied to have any connection with the blast condemning the attack.

"This attack was carried out by some forces in the Turkish special war system in order to sabotage this [treaty] process," said the Workers Party in a statement.
