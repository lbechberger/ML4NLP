According to the United States Geological Survey (USGS) a magnitude 6.1 earthquake has struck Sumatra, Indonesia. The meteorological agency of Indonesia put the magnitude at 6.4.

The epicenter was located 190 kilometers (115 miles) northwest of Bengkulu, Sumatra, Indonesia at 2:27 p.m. (local time) and had a depth of 35 k.m. (21.7 miles). A small magnitude 5.1 aftershock shook the same area just over two hours later.

There are no reports of damage, injuries or death, but the USGS says that damage could be "moderate to heavy." 

No tsunami warning was issued.

Last week, a magnitude 8.4 quake struck the same region killing at least 23 people and injuring over 100. That quake was followed by as many as 60 aftershocks for at least a week, with some ranging as high as magnitude 7.8.
