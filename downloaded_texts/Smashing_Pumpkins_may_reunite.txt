On the same day he released his debut solo album, former Smashing Pumpkins frontman Billy Corgan announced, "I want my band back, and my songs, and my dreams." Those words appeared in a full-page ad that ran in Tuesday's edition of the Chicago Tribune under the title, A Message to Chicago From Billy Corgan. The alternative-rock icon also wrote, "For a year now I have walked around with a secret, a secret I chose to keep. But now I want you to be among the first to know that I have made plans to renew and revive The Smashing Pumpkins."

The group, which included guitarist James Iha, drummer Jimmy Chamberlin, and bassists D'Arcy Wretzky and Melissa Auf der Maur, last played together in 2000. On February 17, 2004, Corgan posted a bitter message on his personal blog calling Wretzky a "mean spirited drug addict" and blaming Iha for the breakup.

It was not clear if Corgan's former band members knew of his plans, or who would be involved with the new group. No other details on the plans were forthcoming from the singer, who lives in the Chicago area.
