A woman in Sacramento, California claims to have spotted the holy figure of Jesus Christ in her burrito.

Valencia Phillips said that, while she was very hungry and actually not very religious, she didn't dare bite into the chimichanga bearing the holy mark. "I've had an amazing, amazing experience. It's been something else," Phillips said.

It is not currently known what will become of the burrito.
