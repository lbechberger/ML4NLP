The UN has certified that the Delhi Metro has aided in the reduction of greenhouse gases, earning 'carbon credits'. This makes the Delhi Metro the first of its kind in the world to do so.

This comes under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) of the UN under the Kyoto Protocol. The UN said the rail based system has helped to save 630,000 tonnes of pollution a year. The credits to the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) are worth $9.5 million for each of the next seven years. More credits would be given for more passengers on the system.

The credits are designed as a financial incentive for developing countries to reduce greenhouse emissions.

The Delhi Metro was started in 2002. According to the DMRC, it has reduced road traffic by more than 91,000 vehicles per day.
