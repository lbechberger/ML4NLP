In Croatiaâ€™s worst ever firefighting tragedy, six men were killed and seven badly injured when they were trapped battling a fierce forest blaze.

The group, including volunteers aged 17 and 18, was encircled by flames Thursday when the wind suddenly changed course while they were fighting the fire on Kornat island, national firefighting chief Mladen Jurin said. Police said eight men had been detained on suspicion of arson. The prime minister of Croatia promised an investigation.

A national day of mourning has been declared for September 3.

The incident follows a series of deadly fires in Greece.
