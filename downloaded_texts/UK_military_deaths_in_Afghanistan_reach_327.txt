On Monday, the Ministry of Defence announced that two UK troops died in Helmand Province, Afghanistan, as the result of two isolated occurrences yesterday. Small arms fire killed one soldier, who came from the 1st Battalion Scots Guards, in the Lashkargah District.

The other individual, a Royal Marine serving in 40 Commando, was in the Sangin District when the explosion of an improvised explosive device (IED) occurred. The families of the deceased have now been notified.

Including these new deaths, the total number of UK military deaths in Afghanistan rose to 327. The UK has been active in Afghanistan since October 2001. 

Announcing the casualties, Task Force Helmand spokesman Lieutenant Colonel David Southall said of the first soldier, "Commanding his men, he was killed in action by small arms fire whilst providing security to the Afghan people." 

"He gave his life whilst seeking to improve the lives of ordinary Afghans. His sacrifice will not be forgotten," Southall said of the marine's death.
