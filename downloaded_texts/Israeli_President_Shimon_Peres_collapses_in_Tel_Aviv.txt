Israeli media is reporting that the country's president Shimon Peres briefly collapsed in Ramat Aviv, a suburb of Tel Aviv, while he was giving a speech. Peres regained consciousness a short time later and was able to stand up, but was still taken to Sheba Medical Center in Tel Aviv by ambulance for observation.

"He feels well and the incident is over. Just to be on the safe side, we are transferring him to Sheba Medical Center for the night. I estimate that he'll be able to return to work Sunday morning," said Dr. Valdan at Sheba Medical center, as quoted by Ynet News. "It was simply very hot and he stood up for a long time and felt dizzy." Peres has no known medical issues.

Director of Sheba Medical Center Ze'ev Rothstein said that Peres is in "excellent" condition. Doctors will perform tests on Peres as a precaution.

"President Shimon Peres is already at the hospital [...] and will undergo a series of tests. His overall condition is excellent but I estimate he'll spend the night here," stated Rothstein.

Peres was speaking at an event for the Young Presidents Organization and answering the audience's questions. Peres, 86, was elected as Israel's President in June 2007.
