Two Australian Rules Football (AFL) players for the Western Bulldogs team rescued a woman who was drowning in the waters of Victoria Harbour, Hong Kong. Midfielder Daniel Cross and defender Tom Williams hauled the woman out of the water and into safe hands.

The woman was believed to have been attempting suicide, and when Cross and Williams threw a life ring out to her, she refused to grab onto it. Initially, the pair were not aware that the woman was suicidal, and only intervened after hearing calls for help from bystanders.

Chief executive of the team Campbell Rose said that "The boys are in good spirit," and that he was extremely proud of the pair.
