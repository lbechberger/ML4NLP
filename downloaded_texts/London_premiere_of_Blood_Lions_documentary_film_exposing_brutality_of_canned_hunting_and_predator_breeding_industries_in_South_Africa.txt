The compelling new documentary film, Blood Lions, which exposes the cruelty of the canned hunting and predator breeding industry in South Africa, will premiere on 27 November at the Royal Geographic Society, London, England – the home of royal and aristocratic hunting. 

The film will screen during England’s official hunting season, despite the country’s 11-year ban on hunting under the . 

‘Blood Lions’ follows acclaimed environmental journalist and safari operator Ian Michler, and Rick Swazey, an American hunter, on their journey to uncover the dark realities of the multi-million dollar predator breeding and canned lion hunting industry in South Africa. 

The film scrutinises the cruelty of canned hunting, the lucrative nature of breeding lions, and how the authorities and professional hunting and tourism bodies have become complicit in allowing the industry to flourish. 

Last year alone, over 800 captive bred lions were shot in South Africa – mostly by wealthy international hunters. According to the film, there are approximately 200 farms and breeding facilities across South Africa, holding between 6000 to 8000 captive predators in questionable conditions. Co-founder of CACH (Campaign Against Canned Hunting) Chris Mercer claims animals “are crammed into small enclosures, their facilities are dirty, and sometimes the water undrinkable.” 

It is legal to breed and hunt captive bred predators in South Africa, but conservationists and animal rights experts are concerned for the animals’ welfare. 

The Blood Lions’ story echoes England’s continuing hunting debate, which is considered an animal welfare issue by fox experts and animals rights activists. 

The London premiere of ‘Blood Lions’ will be held at the Royal Geographic Society, London on the 27th November 2015 at 18H30.
