Police last week launched a number of raids across Melbourne and surrounding areas, targeting hydroponic cannabis-growing operations. There were seven arrests on Thursday, in Melton and Werribee, across the western and northern suburbs, and a farm near Bacchus Marsh.

Three men appeared in court on Friday. One man, arrested at the farm, was charged with cultivating cannabis after police found 102 plants growing hydroponically.

According to Acting Detective Senior Sergeant Jason Kelly the raids come at the end of a six month operation. He said that more arrests would be following in the next few weeks.

These arrests coincide with the State and Federal governments tough new stance on cannabis, and hydroponically grown cannabis in particular. The Prime Minister John Howard, and NSW Premier Morris Iemma, have linked cannabis use to mental illness, citing a number of statements by researchers.
