The Nepalese Constituent Assembly, elected on April 10, in Nepal recently voted to abolish its monarchy, with a large majority supporting the vote in parliament. "The Nepalese people have been freed from centuries of feudal tradition and the doors have now opened for a radical social and economic transformation," said a government spokesperson, commenting on the decision.

The former king, Gyanendra of Nepal, has been given two weeks to leave his palace. Authorities say that he will be forced out if he fails to leave during that period of time.

The Nepalese president, Girija Prasad Koirala, also commented on the move: "Today is the day when my dreams have been realized and similarly the dreams of the nation have perhaps also been realized." 

Ban Ki-moon, the Secretary General of the United Nations, said that by supporting the switch to a republic, the Nepalese people have "clearly spoken for peace and change."
