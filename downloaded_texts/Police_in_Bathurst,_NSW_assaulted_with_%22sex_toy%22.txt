A police officer at the annual Bathurst 1000 motorsport event in Bathurst, New South Wales has been assaulted by a dildo, with another man arrested for publically displaying pornography.

Police allege that a 22-year-old man from Moss Vale approached a male police officer seated inside a police vehicle. It is alleged the man launched at the officer hitting him in the head with a "sex toy". The officer was uninjured in the incident.

The man was arrested and charged with assaulting police.

Earlier in the evening, police from the Public Order and Riot Squad came across a man displaying pornographic material on a television he had mounted on a trolley walking around the McPhillamy Park Campsite. The 35 year-old man from St Helen's Park was arrested and taken to the on site police station where he was questioned. Police conducted a search of the man's tent where around 20 pornographic DVDs were located.

The man was charged with displaying pornographic material.

Assistant Commissioner Shearer said, “Camping on the mountain are families with young children and for someone to deliberately walk around displaying pornographic material is completely unacceptable.”

“Police are working tirelessly to ensure that the event remains a family friendly event where by all spectators can enjoy the V8 Super cars as they intended. The behaviour displayed by some individuals is extremely disappointing, however, overall the fans have been very well behaved.”

Both men were ejected from the event and cannot return to the Mount Panorama circuit for the remainder of the event.
