The Mathew Street festival, an annual event held in Liverpool, has started today. Claiming to be the largest free Music festival in Europe, it gets its name from the street on which the Cavern Club was situated. Last year some 370,000 people attended the event.

75 bands will perform on five stages across the city and free live music at another 40 indoor venues throughout the August Bank Holiday weekend. The Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra will make its debut at the festival on Friday, 7.30pm at the Pier Head. The Lightning Seeds are headlining the festival on Sunday. Gerry and the Pacemakers will also be playing as well as up to 30 unsigned local bands.
