Republican officials announced today that Rep. Dennis Hastert of Illinois will be leaving the United States Congress when his present congressional term concludes at the end of next year. 

Hastert has served in Illinois' 14th district since 1987 and his time as Speaker makes him longest serving Republican Speaker in history. Party officials have scheduled a formal announcement of Hastert's retirement for Friday, August 17.

Hastert's decision has been expected since the Republicans lost the elections last November and he was removed as Speaker. For eight years, he's been second in line of presidential succession behind only the vice-president.

The party officials who discussed his planned retirement did so on condition of anonymity because there had been no public announcement yet.
