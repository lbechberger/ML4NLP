A 41 year old who had worked at the Fukushima Daiichi power plant between 2012 and 2013 has been the first clean up worker to be diagnosed of cancer. His cancer was caused by exposure to nuclear radiation as efforts are still continuing to clean up the Fukushima nuclear power plant after its explosion in March of 2011. 

The person has not been identified but has been diagnosed with acute myelogenous Leukaemia which is commonly known as cancer to blood and bone marrow. Acute in cancer procedures means it is a rapid progression of the disease. A Health ministry official fronted the press and states: 

“The person went to the doctor because he was not feeling well. That was when he was diagnosed with Leukaemia” 
 
He had been situated at the number 3 and 4 reactors and had worn full protective equipment during his time at the plant. There have been ten other cases of cancer. Seven which have been dropped while three other have yet to be confirmed. 

Over the past four years a total of 45 000 people have helped with the clean up of Fukushima which has cost the Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) an estimation of 100 Billion US. The Japanese government will expect to be under a lot of criticism as a second a nuclear reactor was reopened less than a week ago. 

The Fukushima power plant radiation leak has so far claimed one death. Two years ago former manager of the Fukushima plant Masao Yoshida died of esophageal cancer as TEPCO have disputed that his death was not a direct result of the radiation. Unfortunately it seems that more people will be effected in the future and the amount of people that it will be affected is uncertain.
