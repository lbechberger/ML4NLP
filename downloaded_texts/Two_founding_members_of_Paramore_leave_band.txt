Two of the founding members of US rock band Paramore have quit. Brothers Josh and Zac Farro left the group after last Saturday's concert in Orlando, Florida. Front woman Hayley Williams announced that the brothers had told group members about their plans to leave two months before the Orlando concert.

Williams published a statement on the bands official website. "For the last year it hasn't seemed as if they wanted to be around any more," she said. "We want Josh and Zac to do something that makes them happy and if that isn't here with us, then we support them finding happiness elsewhere."

However the rock group have announced plans to stay together after the Farro brothers departure. Williams added: "We never for a second thought about leaving any of this behind. The three of us who are still here are ready to take on another chapter of our journey together ... Knowing that we have a unified passion and a clear vision makes us feel stronger than ever."

The brothers had been with Paramore since the group founded in 2004. Zac played the drums while Josh was a guitarist. The group has received numerous accomplishments including a Grammy Award nomination.
