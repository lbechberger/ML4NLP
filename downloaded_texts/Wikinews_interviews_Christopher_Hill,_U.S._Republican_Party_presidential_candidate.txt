U.S. Air Force veteran and airline pilot Christopher V. Hill of New Hampshire took some time to talk with Wikinews about his campaign for the U.S. Republican Party's 2016 presidential nomination.

Hill served in Operation Desert Storm, flying about fifty combat missions. Shortly after the war, he returned to civilian life, working as a loader and then a pilot for the United Parcel Service. In 2010, he organized the "Pilots and Patriots Defending the Constitution" ahead of the that year's midterm elections. Hill ran his first campaign for president in 2012, seeking the Republican nomination. In that cycle, he appeared on the primary ballot in two states, receiving 108 votes in the New Hampshire primary and 139 in the Arizona primary. Former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney ultimately received the nomination and lost to incumbent president Barack Obama.

With Wikinews reporter William S. Saturnâ€Ž, Hill discusses his 2016 campaign, his political background, and his policy proposals.
