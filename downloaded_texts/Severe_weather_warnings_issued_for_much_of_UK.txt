Severe weather warnings have been issued for much of the UK, with England, Wales and Northern Ireland subject to weather warnings. Much of Scotland was also subject to a weather warning earlier today, although they have now been removed.

It has been forecasted that winds of up to 130 km/h will hit the southern and western areas of the United Kingdom in what has been predicted by some to be the worst storm this winter. The Met Office has said that there is a 60% risk of disruption for much of southern England and Wales, although the figure for Scotland is less then 20%.

David Rooke from the UK's Environment Agency (EA) said that "We're giving a very strong message to stay away from coastal areas," and that "There will be huge waves, a lot of spray and it will be a very dangerous place to be."

On its website the Met Office said that "the Met Office continues to expect an intense low pressure system to move east across the UK during Monday, bringing severe gales and potentially damaging gusts across some areas, more particularly the west and south of England and Wales. Southerly winds are expected to strengthen during the early hours of Monday to give severe gales for a time, coinciding with the morning rush hour in some areas."
