The Minnesota Republican Party is distributing a CD as part of a lobbying effort seeking a definition of marriage amendment, which would outlaw gay marriage.

Along with its pitch for the definition of marriage amendment, the CD asks people their views on various controversial issues, including abortion, gun control, and illegal immigration.

The CD has raised privacy concerns after it was discovered that the information is reported back to the Minnesota Republican Party along with the name of the person filling out the questionnaire, while the CD does not reveal that the data is being sent.

Governor Tim Pawlenty has said that the CD "should make clear that [it] is mining information."
