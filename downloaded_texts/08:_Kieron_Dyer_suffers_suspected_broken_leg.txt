West Ham United midfielder Kieron Dyer suffered a suspected broken leg in the Carling Cup tie against Bristol Rovers.

Dyer, who joined from Newcastle United at the start of this season, was carried off on a stretcher in the first few minutes of the game.

The 28 year old was injured in a tackle by Joe Jacobson and the game was delayed before he was taken to hospital.

The Hammers won the match to reach the 3rd Round 2-1 but boss Alan Curbishley said: "It's immaterial. We are so devastated for him. I can't put it into words really. You put a strong side out and you wonder why sometimes. We are delighted we have got through but after 10 or 15 minutes the game was immaterial. Everyone in the dressing room is really down about it."
