Witnesses in central Somalia have said that at least fourteen people were killed in a third day of fighting between Islamist groups.

The al-Shabaab and the Ahlu Sunna Wal-Jama groups clashed in the villages of Wabho and Warhole late yesterday. Local residents say the fighting continued into today, and has prompted hundreds of people to flee their homes.

"At least 14 people died and 32 others were injured in Warhole. Most of the casualties are fighters from both groups. So far 250 families, mostly pastoralists have fled and there is fear fighting might spread to other areas," commented Ali Yasin Geddi, vice chairman of Elman peace and human rights, to the Reuters news agency.
