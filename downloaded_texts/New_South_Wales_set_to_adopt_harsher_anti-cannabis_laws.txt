New South Wales Premier Morris Iemma has proposed strengthening the states anti-cannabis laws. The government is undertaking a complete rewrite of such laws in response to concerns voiced by some health professionals about the link between the drug and mental health issues. The proposed legislation will also increase jail sentences for those convicted of growing cannabis . 

"There is growing evidence of a link between long-term cannabis use and the incidence of severe mental health problems," said Mr Iemma. 

Under the plan the current cannabis cautioning system, introduced in 2000 , is to be reviewed . Cannabis users would be required to attend counseling to "understand the link between cannabis use and mental illness" to avoid being charged for their first offence. At present those issued with their second cautioning notice are required to call a counseling service.
