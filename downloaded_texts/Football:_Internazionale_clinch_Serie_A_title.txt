A 2-1 victory over Siena and a loss by Roma allowed Internazionale to uncork the champagne as they clinched the Serie A title for the first time since 1988-89. Inter were awarded the Scudetto last year after Juventus was stripped of the award due to the match fixing scandal, though this year they have won it on the pitch. Inter could have secured the title last week when they took on Roma at the San Siro, but Roma killed their record dreams with a 3-1 win.

Inter scored first against Siena on Sunday through defender Marco Materazzi, but Siena levelled minutes later through Paolo Negro. A penalty in the 60th minute was then awarded to Inter, and Materazzi dispatched the ball home to earn them the three points.

Meanwhile at the Stadio Azzurri D`Italia, Atalanta hosted Roma, as the Nerazzurri attempted to prolong Inter's celebrations. Atalanta shook Roma with two first half goals by Cristiano Doni and Riccardo Zampagna. A goal midway through the second half by Simone Perrotta pulled Roma within one, but they could not produce a comeback as frustration boiled over for defender Matteo Ferrari, who was red carded for a cynical challenge.

After securing the title, Inter revealed a contract extension for manager Roberto Mancini. The deal is for four years with an option to extend for another 12 months. Speculation has arose as of late about a replacement, but Mancini's title wining season earned him the stay.
