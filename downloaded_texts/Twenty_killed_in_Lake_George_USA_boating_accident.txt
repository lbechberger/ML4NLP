Twenty elderly people were killed Sunday when a boat capsized on Lake George in upstate New York. The Ethan Allen was filled with touring passengers from the Detroit, Michigan area, all of whom were on a pleasure cruise to see fall foliage in the Adirondack Mountains. All the passengers aboard were reported to have not worn life preservers.

Investigators speculate that the Ethan Allen capsized when it steered into the wake of another tour boat, causing the former to turn sharply. The incident occurred at 3:00 PM EDT (2000 UTC) about 150 yards offshore at Cramer Point. Amongst those who survived was the captain, Richard Paris, 74, who was reportedly the only crew member aboard the boat.

The boat operator company's license has been temporarily revoked pending a urine analysis test for alcohol consumption 80 hours before the incident. All other boat licenses owned by the company are also being held.
