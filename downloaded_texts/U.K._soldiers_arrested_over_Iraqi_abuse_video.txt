Three British soldiers have now been arrested by military police in connection with the video showing abuse of Iraqi civilians by U.K. troops. One of them is reported to be the cameraman.

The video, filmed January 2004 in the town of Amara north of Basra and made public on Saturday, shows the troops punching, kicking and beating four Iraqi teenagers with batons just inside their compound. A leering commentary is provided by the cameraman. 

Earlier footage showed an explosion in the compound, reportedly from one of three hand grenades thrown by Iraqi protesters. The marines then ran outside, apprehended these four Iraqi youths and brought them inside the walls, where the abuse took place.

The provincial council in Basra has suspended relations with the British forces in response to the footage, which has been widely shown in the Arab media. Two Iraqis claiming to be among the abused youths have come forward demanding compensation, and the abuse has been condemned in Britain and across the Middle East.
