Twin car bombs killed 21 in Karbala, southern Iraq yesterday evening. The suicide attacks, on the road from Najaf, occurred at around 7:00 PM (16:00 UTC). 

At least 47 people were injured, according to Salid Kadhim, spokesman for Karbala's health authorities, who went on to tell AFP, "Most of the killed and wounded are policemen and civilians." 

Hundreds of thousands of pilgrims are expected to travel to Karbala and nearby Najaf to celebrate the anniversary of the birthday of the Mahdi.
