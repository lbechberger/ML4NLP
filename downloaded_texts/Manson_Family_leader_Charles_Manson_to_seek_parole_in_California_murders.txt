Leader of the Manson Family cult Charles Manson, who has tried to get parole 11 times, will have another opportunity to seek it again Wednesday, for his life sentence for his 1969 slayings of actress Sharon Tate and six others. The 77 year old’s last parole hearing occurred in 2007. 



Manson didn’t go to his last parole hearing in 2007, saying that he was a "prisoner of the political system." He isn’t expected to attend the Wednesday hearing either, according to a spokesperson at Corcoran State Prison.

The district attorney’s office in Los Angeles said it strongly opposed Manson’s release. 

"We consistently (opposed parole) and will continue to do so," spokeswoman Sandi Gibbons said.

Manson has hoarded cell phones in his cell, and they were confiscated by the guards. Thirty days were added to his sentence for this offence. In 2009, Manson called people in California, New Jersey, and Florida with an LG flip phone found under his bed.

Guards found a second cell phone a year later, and a homemade weapon was found as well. 

Manson was found guilty of telling a group of his followers to break into the home Roman Polanski and his wife Sharon Tate were renting in a town near Beverly Hills. The followers killed Tate and all six of the people at her home.
