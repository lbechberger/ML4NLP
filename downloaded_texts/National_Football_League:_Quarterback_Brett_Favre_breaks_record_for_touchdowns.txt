Quarterback Brett Favre of the Green Bay Packers broke Dan Marino's record for career touchdown passes on Sunday, throwing number 421 to receiver Greg Jennings with 4:56 left in the first quarter. The recordbreaking pass was a 16-yard slant route, and Favre had to throw a bullet to complete it. Though the game was being played at the Metrodome, even the Minnesota Vikings fans stood and applauded as Favre celebrated with his teammates.

After the announcement of the record was made, a taped message from Marino played on the Jumbotron. 

"Hey Brett, it's Dan Marino. I'd like to take a minute to congratulate you on breaking one of the great records in sports. I loved holding the touchdown record for the past 13 years, but if someone was going to break it, I'm glad it was someone like you, who has always competed at the highest level and always played only to win," said Marino. "Over the past 17 years, you've been a credit to the Packers, and to the National Football League and to the sport that we all love so much. Brett, congratulations on touchdown 421!"

This historic event came just two weeks after Favre broke John Elway's record for career wins by a quarterback, defeating the New York Giants for win number 149. The Green Bay icon also holds the records for career completions and consecutive games started by a quarterback, which continued on Sunday at 241. Later in the second quarter of today's game, Favre threw the 8,359th pass of his career, eclipsing another of Marino's records. 

When asked about the record after the game, a subdued Favre said,"It's just a number. Am I proud? Absolutely. I'm more proud of the fact that we won this game...I'm pleased it's over, and I'm honored. To play this long, I think, is a special thing and to achieve this is, uh, very special,". He added that, in his mind, Dan Marino is still the best quarterback of all time.
