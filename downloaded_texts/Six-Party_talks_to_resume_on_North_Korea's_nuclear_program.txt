Six Party talks between China, Japan, the United States, Russia, South Korea, and North Korea are set to resume talks in regards to North Korea's nuclear weapons program.

"They [North Korea] have indicated they are interested in an end to what they call the U.S. 'hostile policy. We made very clear to them that we don't have a hostile policy to them. We have a hostile policy to their policies, including and especially their nuclear policies," said Christopher Hill, the assistant to the Secretary of State, according to the United Press International.

The talks are scheduled to begin on December 16, 2006 in Beijing, China, but no country involved in the talks have confirmed the reports.
