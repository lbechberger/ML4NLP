According to the United States Geological Survey (USGS), a magnitude 5.4 earthquake struck southern California in the Chino Hills area (San Bernardino County) near Los Angeles California, east of Highway 142. It occurred at about 11:42 a.m. (PDT), and lasted approximately one minute.

The USGS preliminary report states the earthquake's epicenter was located near a golf course in an upscale community 3 km (2 miles) southwest from Chino Hills, or 47 km (29 miles) east-southeast of Los Angeles. It was centered about 7.6 miles below the surface. The shaking is reported to have been felt as far as away as San Diego and Las Vegas, Nevada.

Fire officials have said that there have been no reports of injuries, deaths or damages, but the USGS states that damage could be moderate. Public safety officials are asking people who live in the area to inspect their homes for gas and water leaks, as well as to contact older or disabled relatives to check their safety. Officials advise evacuating homes if leaking gas can be detected.

As many as thirty-four aftershocks registering a magnitude 3.8 and lower have been recorded since the initial earthquake. The earthquake originally registered a 5.8, but was later reduced to a 5.4 by the USGS.

CBS Television showed images of the recording of the TV Show "Judge Judy", which was interrupted by the earthquake, the results of which were caught by the camera crew.
