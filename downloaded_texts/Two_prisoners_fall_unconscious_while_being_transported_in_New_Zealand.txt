Two out of three prisoners fell unconscious while being transported in a prison van from Wellington District Court to Upper Hutt, New Zealand's Rimutaka prison, the third remained conscious for the entire duration. It was said by the third prisoner that there was a strong gas leak that was entering their van.

An investigation has been launched by the New Zealand Department of Corrections in regards to where the leak originated from. The van has been removed from service until the cause has been determined.

The third prisoner said: "Shortly after the van left Wellington gas started seeping into the back of the van." Once the prisoner became aware of the leak he tried to grab the attention of the staff to stop the van by banging on the walls. The van did not stop. The staff followed correct procedure during the transport.

Dave East, Department of Corrections regional manager for Wellington, last night, said: "Two prisoners were found unconscious on their arrival at Rimutaka Prison... The prisoners quickly regained consciousness."

All three were checked by both a prison medical team and then later hospital staff as a precaution. It has not yet been determined why the prisoners were overcome and what by. They have been returned to prison.
