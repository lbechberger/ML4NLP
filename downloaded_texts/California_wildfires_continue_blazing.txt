In Yucca Valley, California, USA, wildfires destroyed nearly 110 square miles of land (285 square km), burning over 45,000 acres (182 square km), as the outcome of two wildfires merging into one. Current conditions could only make it worse.

Over 3,000 firefighters and 36 aircraft were sent to fight the blaze, which some predicted would reach all the way to Big Lear Lake, a popular summer getaway vacation area, about 80 miles east of Los Angeles, California (129 km). Temperatures there reached up to 112°F (44.5°C).

Firefighters fighting the wildfire have successfully stopped it from burning the resort and other communities nearby in its path.

The continuous winds and the intense heat would only mean that the blaze would last even longer and call for more firefighters to overtake the flames.

California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger has declared a state of emergency for San Bernardino County as a result of the wildfires.
