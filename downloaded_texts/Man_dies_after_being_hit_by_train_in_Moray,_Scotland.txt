A man has died after being impacted by a train on a railway line in Moray, Scotland. The man, who is currently remaining publicly unidentified, was hit by the train, which was travelling between the city of Inverness and the town of Montrose, at approximately 0920 GMT on Saturday. The man was pronounced dead at the scene of the collision. The British Transport Police have denied claims that the man had been killed as the result of an incident at a level crossing.

The death is not being treated as suspicious. The British Transport Police have commenced an investigation to determine what happened; members of the force could be sighted on the railway line in search of evidence. A report is anticipated to be handed over to the Procurator Fiscal later.

A spokesperson for the British Transport Police stated: "At 9.21am on Saturday, British Transport Police attended the Brodie automatic half-barrier level crossing at Forres to a report of a person having been struck by a train. Paramedics and officers from Grampian Police and British Transport Police attended the scene, where a male person was found and declared dead."
