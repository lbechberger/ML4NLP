A 46-year-old motorist from South Woodham Ferrers, Essex, England was hit by a frozen sausage on his way home. The projecticle flew through his open car window and broke his nose. When the Essex Ambulance Service arrived he had lost a large amount of blood, but he appears to now be recovering.

An ambulance service official says the 46-year-old man suffered a broken nose and lost a lot of blood.

The spokesman say it must have been an incredibly lucky, or unlucky, shot - to get the sausage through a moving car window. Police are now investigating the case of the flying sausage.
