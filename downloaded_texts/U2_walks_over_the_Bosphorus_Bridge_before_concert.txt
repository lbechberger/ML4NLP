Members of Irish rock band U2 took a walk on Istanbul's famous Bosphorus Bridge connecting Europe and Asia on Sunday, accompanied by Turkish ministers Egemen Bağış and Hayati Yazıcı.

Lead singer Bono gave a speech during the trip. "Last September I was asking, what would be the most inspiring thing about Istanbul? And I said you know[, Bağış], it is the bridge between the East and the West, Europe and Asia, the secular and the religious. It is very important. And then you suggested 'maybe would you like to walk on the bridge? Would you like to play a concert?' And I said a walk will be much easier than a concert. Now I am not so sure."

U2 have also met with Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan in the Dolmabahçe Palace before their concert at Atatürk Olympic Stadium as part of the U2 360° Tour. They presented him a red iPod nano.
