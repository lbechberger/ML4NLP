The German federal Constitutional Court, the Bundesverfassungsgericht, has dismissed the complaints by two Members of the Bundestag against the dissolving of the parliament and removed the last obstacle on the road to early elections on September 18th.

Jelena Hoffmann from chancellor Gerhard Schröder's Socialdemocrats and Werner Schulz from the Greens, which are also members of the government, claimed that the loss of confidence by Schröder on July 1st was orchestrated and that President Horst Köhler had therefore no right to dissolve the Bundestag on July 21st.

The majority of the court, voting 7:1, disagreed with that assessment. It ruled, that Schröder's declaration, saying he does not have a reliable majority in parliament for his reform programme, is "plausible" and added that the Constitution grants the chancellor wide freedom in that matter.

Representatives of all major parties have welcomed the decision.
