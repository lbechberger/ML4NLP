The house where Josef Fritzl used to live and where he imprisoned his daughter is set to be demolished. 

Fritzl locked his daughter Elisabeth in the make-shift dungeon for 24 years. During that time he raped her repeatedly â€” and fathered seven children with her, one of whom died in the basement of the house.

Judge Markus Sonnleitner stated, "There is a lot of interest in seeing it disappear. This seems to be the sensible course as there is little chance of ever selling the property for a profit. It should be done as quickly as possible." Ever since the case became known in 2008, there has been a question over what would happen with the property.

The property, in Ybbstrasse, Austria, has become an unlikely tourist attraction with several people showing up to take pictures of the house. The door is sealed shut to stop anyone from gaining entry to the building.

On Thursday, Fritzl received the news that he has been granted planning permission to build a project consisting of houses, an office block and an underground carpark. Fritzl produced the blueprints for the project two years before police were aware of his crimes.

Judge Sonnleitner announced the plans as part of Fritzl's ongoing bankruptcy case.
