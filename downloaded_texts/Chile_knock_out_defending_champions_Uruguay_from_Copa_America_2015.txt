On Wednesday, Chile, the host nation, defeated the defending champions, Uruguay, in the first quarter final of the 2015 which was held in Estadio Nacional Julio Martínez Prádanos stadium in Santiago, Chile.

La Roja had 80% possession of the ball in front of Uruguay. Two Uruguayan players were red carded in this match.

Mauricio Isla scored in the 81st minute, assisted by Jorge Valdívia, the only goal of the match. Cavani got his yellow card at the 29th by arguing with a linesman. 11 minutes later, Uruguayan defender Jorge Fucile was booked for clattering on Vargas. The first half ended with 0–0 score, and four players booked. 

Cavani's father Luis Cavani was arrested earlier this week over a Monday truck crash in which a 19-year-old motorcyclist was killed. Then, in the 63rd minute Chilean defender Jara provoked Cavani reportedly by putting his finger in Cavani's anus. Cavani touched Jara's face, and Jara fell to the ground causing Cavani to get a card. The Uruguayan team had only nine men left after Fucile received his second yellow card for a foul on Alexis Sánchez.
