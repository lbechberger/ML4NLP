Mullah Dadullah, a high ranking official for the Taliban in Afghanistan has said that the leader of al-Qaeda Osama bin Laden is "still alive" and that "messages are exchanged to share plans" with Bin Laden. Dadullah also said that they "go to the battlefield together."

"Only his comrades see him; we exchange messages with each other to share plans. We also go to the battlefield together. We actually meet very rarely, just for important consultations. It's hard for anyone to meet Bin Laden himself now, but we know he's still alive," said Dadullah.

Dadullah also claims that there are "hundreds" of suicide bombers that are prepared and ready to hit the NATO peacekeeping forces in Afghanistan and that Americans will "reap the crop for a long time" also saying that the Taliban and al-Qaeda will get "revenge" on the United States either inside or outside Afghanistan.

"The Americans have sown a seed. They will reap the crop for quite a long time. We will get our revenge on them, whether in Afghanistan or outside," said Dadullah.

"The suicide martyrs, those willing to blow themselves up, are countless. Hundreds have registered their names already and are ready to go and we have hundreds more on the waiting list. Each is anxious to be the first to be sent," added Dadullah.

Dadullah also says that Islam "is more important than anything."

"For the Taliban, Islam is more important than anything else. It's our religious duty to shelter any Muslim brother who's on the run from the infidels, even at the cost of our government."

So far, the U.S. has not been able to confirm or deny the information and Dadullah has not stated where bin Laden may be hiding.
