UK Home Secretary John Reid contradicted the Prime Minister’s opinion that foreign policy and the war in Iraq are not the reason some Muslim youth turn to terrorism. 

Reid is reported as saying in an interview with the London Evening Standard "I do believe that foreign policy is sometimes a motivating factor in radicalisation of young Muslims and the potential recruitment to terror…It is better to be frank about it. To say it isn't a cause isn't to say it has nothing to do with the whole process."

Blair has said repeatedly that the idea that the war had been a factor in radicalising youth was "rubbish" and, when speaking to the Commons Liaison Committee said it should be "challenged at every level".
