A young woman was killed Friday night after an accident occurred on a gyrating ride at the Playland amusement park in Rye, New York in the United States. The woman, Gabriela Garin, was a worker at the amusement park, and had worked there for the past seven years. 

The accident occurred near the end of Garin's shift; as she was loading riders onto the ride. The ride's new operator, unaware of Garin's presence, started the ride while Garin was still on it. The new operator then noticed Garin, and shut the ride down in 20 seconds, but Garin had already been ejected from the ride and killed, according to a park spokesperson. 

The ride is an attraction that spins people around in two-seat cars, inside a darkened tent to flashing lights and music. 

This incident is not the first in the ride's history. In 2004, a seven-year-old from Connecticut managed to free herself from the ride's restraining bars, and climb onto the front edge of her seat. She fell soon after the ride started. A safety precaution was put in place after this incident, however, the spokesperson acknowledged that it was not followed when Garin was killed.

The company which owns the ride shut it down, along with two other rides it owns at the park. 

This is the fourth fatality in the park's history. The park features more than 50 rides, a pool, and a beach. It attracts more than 1 million visitors annually.
