Writer and television presenter Peaches Geldof, 25, was found dead today in her home near Wrotham in Kent, England. Kent Police said they are treating her death as "unexplained and sudden". She was pronounced dead on the scene by the ambulance service.

Peaches is the second daughter of Bob Geldof and television presenter Paula Yates. Starting as a teenager, Geldof wrote for magazines and newspapers including Elle, the The Daily Telegraph and The Guardian, as well as presenting OMG! with Peaches Geldof on ITV2. At the time of her death, she was in her second marriage, to musician Thomas Cohen. She has two sons, Astala and Phaedra, both from the marriage with Cohen. She previously was married for six months to musician Max Drummey.

Bob Geldof said "We are beyond pain. She was the wildest, funniest, cleverest, wittiest and the most bonkers of all of us. What a beautiful child. How is this possible that we will not see her again? How is that bearable?"

Thomas Cohen also paid tribute: "My beloved wife Peaches was adored by myself and her two sons Astala and Phaedra and I shall bring them up with their mother in their hearts everyday. We shall love her forever."
