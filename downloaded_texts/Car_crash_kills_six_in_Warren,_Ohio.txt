Six were killed, two injured in Warren, Ohio yesterday after teenagers in an acquired Honda Passport hit a guardrail and overturned into a pond. High speed contributed to the crash, investigators with the state highway patrol reported.

The SUV sank, with five teenagers inside. The sixth fatality was found under the car. Two other passengers escaped, ran to a phone, and called emergency services.

The dead were 19-year-old Alexis Cayson, 14-year-old Andrique Bennett, 17-year-old Brandon Murray, and 15-year-olds Kirklan Behner, Daylan Ray, and Ramone White. The survivors, 18-year-old Brian Henry and 15-year-old Asher Lewis, were taken to the hospital and released.

"We will not be speculating on alcohol and-or drug usage pending toxicology reports," said Lieutenant Brian Holt of the state highway patrol.

Leuitenant Holt said the vehicle in question was not reported stolen but the teenagers did not have permission to use it. There was extensive damage to the front and rear of the car; the windows were cracked and broken. The car belonged to a Youngstown resident.

The fire department deployed a cold water rescue team and brought two of the teenagers to the hospital, where they were pronounced dead. The two who survived were treated for minor injuries.

A makeshift memorial has been set up at the scene with teddy bears and notes. 

A school attended by several of the victims opened for counseling.

A friend of Behner, 18-year-old Rick Bowling, said, "He was one of a kind [...] Everyone knew him in the neighborhood. In school, he always made everyone laugh. [...] Basically, enjoy every second in life [...] Enjoy life while you've got it and while you're here and enjoy people that you love."

This crash was the most fatal in three years in the state.
