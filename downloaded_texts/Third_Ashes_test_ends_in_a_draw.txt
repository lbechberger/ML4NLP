The Third Ashes test ended in a draw as England ended 1 wicket short of victory. A captain's innings of 156 by Ricky Ponting helped Australia save the game on the fifth day. 

When Ponting was dismissed with four overs to go a tense endgame ensued as England sought the final wicket but Brett Lee and Glenn McGrath fought to deny them that prize.

Earlier in the game the batsmen held sway as the third test saw the first centuries of the series from England's Michael Vaughan (166) and Andrew Strauss (106). 

With England setting Australia an unlikely 423 to win in just over a day it was Ponting's 156 that was the most significant contribution as he batted for six hours to deny England a second consecutive victory.

The series remains at 1-1 with two matches to play.

Scores: England 444 and 280-6 dec. Australia 302 and 371-9
