The results of the appeals in the massive Italian football match-fixing scandal have today been announced by the Italian federal court. All four clubs involved saw their original punishments reduced.

Juventus originally were relegated to Serie B with a thirty-point deduction. Their appeal still sees them in Italian football's second division, but with their points deduction almost halved to seventeen. They will still have their last two Scudettos stripped off them and the 2005-06 title will not be assigned to anyone. They will also have to play three games behind closed doors.

AC Milan will remain in Serie A and with their points deduction reduced from fifteen to just eight. They will play one match behind closed doors. However, importantly, they have been reinstated into the Champions League, but will have to play in the third qualifying round.

Fiorentina and Lazio have been reinstated into Serie A, having been demoted into Serie B originally. However, both clubs have had their points deductions increased, in Fiorentina's case the deduction was twelve points and Lazio will start the season with -11 points having originally had a seven-point penalty. Both clubs will not be allowed to play in European competitions next season and will have stadium bans. Fiorentina must play three games behind closed doors and for Lazio it's two.
