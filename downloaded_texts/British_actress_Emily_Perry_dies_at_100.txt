Emily Perry, a British actress has died at the age of 100.

Born on June 28, 1907 in Torquay, Devon, England, she was known for playing Madge Allsop, Dame Edna Everage's long-suffering, silent "bridesmaid"; she began playing the role at the age of 80.

Barry Humphries (Dame Edna) said, "It is a great loss to me, she was a close friend."

As an actress in her own right, her filmography is limited to her appearances with Dame Edna, except for a 1995 appearance, in her late eighties, on an episode of Last of the Summer Wine as "Mrs. Broadbent".

She appeared as herself in Night of a Thousand Faces. Prior to gaining fame, Perry spent 25 years running a dancing school for children.
