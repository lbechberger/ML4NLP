The Governor General of Canada Adrienne Clarkson signed an ordinance today removing David Ahenakew from membership in the Order of Canada. Ahenakew becomes the second person to be stripped of the honor; former NHLPA president Alan Eagleson was the first to be removed in 1998. Eagleson admitted guilt on charges of extortion and obstructing justice.

Ahenakew was removed from the Order three days after being convicted of charges of willing promoting hatred against the Jewish people. The charges stem from comments made to a reporter in 2002 about Jews. Ahenakew stated that Jews were "a disease" and that Hitler was trying to "clean up the world" when he "fried six million of those guys." 

The Advisory Council of the Order of Canada met on June 29 at Rideau Hall, the residence of the Governor General, to discuss Ahenakew's fate. After the meeting, Ahenakew was sent a letter, asking for him to respond to the possible revocation or surrender his membership voluntarily. A deadline for Ahenakew to respond was set at July 9, which Ahenakew did not. That led to Governor General signing the ordinance to remove Ahenakew from the Order. Ahenakew has to surrender his Order insignia, which consists of a medal, lapel pin, and scroll. Ahenakew loses the right to use post-nominal letters in his name, and loses the right to use the Order motto in his personal coat of arms.
