English club Tottenham Hotspur dropped out of the UEFA Cup after a 2-2 draw at White Hart Lane against Spanish side Sevilla. Spurs lost the first game 2-1 in Spain, and the tie was enough to see Sevilla through 4-3 on aggregate.

Sevilla had a 2-0 lead after just eight minutes in London. Steed Malbranque scored an own goals after 3 minutes as he attempted to clear the ball off the line. The ball scuffed off the bottom of his boot and bobbled into the net. Former Tottenham player Freddie Kanoute then doubled the visitors lead only minutes later after he collected the ball, played a one two, and danced around keeper Paul Robinson. Before the end of the first half, Dimitar Berbatov struck the post off a hammered shot, but the score remained 2-0.

Tottenham struck back in the second half and substitute Jermain Defoe scored minutes after coming on to cut Sevilla's lead. Just a minute later, Aaron Lennon tied the game, putting pressure on Sevilla. Two more chances emerged for Tottenham, one through defender Michael Dawson and Dimitar Berbatov, but neither where able to convert. With only stoppage time remaining, and Spurs in need of two goals to advance, frustration played out as Teemu Tainio was red carded for a dangerous challenge on Puerta.

Sevilla was one of three Spanish sides to advance to the semi-finals Thursday, and they will face Osasuna in the next round, guaranteeing there will be a Spanish club in the final. Tottenham have only the Premiership left to contend for now, as they look to book a European spot for next season against Wigan Athletic on the 15th.
