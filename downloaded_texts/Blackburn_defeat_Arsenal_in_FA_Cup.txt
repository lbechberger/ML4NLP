Another FA Cup replay occurred last night, featuring Blackburn and Arsenal at Ewood Park. The previous game was played to a 0 - 0 draw, with defensive strength showing on Blackburn's side. This game went much the same way, with Arsenal controlling the game, but not delivering any potent strikes. Arsenal had an appeal for a penalty when keeper Brad Friedel brought down Jermie Aliadiere in the box, but referee Graham Poll dubbed the challenge fair. Arsenals best chance came through Julio Baptista, who tried to head in a Denilson free kick, but the attempt sailed over the crossbar, not troubling Brad Friedel. Blackburn had their own chance on 53 minutes, but Morten Gamst Pederson's shot flew wide of the post after he did well to make space in the box. 10 minutes later, Blackburn made two substitutions, putting Benni McCarthy and David Dunn into the match at the exspense of Tugay and Nonda. Arsenal made a change several minutes later, as Clich replaced Traore. Baptista continued to threaten the Blackburn goal, but a great save from Friedel and a misplaced header kept the game tied. As the game drew close to extra time, Benni McCarthy produced a wonderful goal, as he beat out Senderos and curled the ball into the top left corner. Arsenal attempted to strike back, but they left it too late, as Blackburn advanced to the next round. 
Blackburn will play Manchester City in the next round of the FA Cup.
