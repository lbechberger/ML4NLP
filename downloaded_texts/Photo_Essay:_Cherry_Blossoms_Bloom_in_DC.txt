The Japanese Cherry Blossoms have again bloomed around the Tidal Basin in Washington, D.C. and a city along with thousands of visitors mark the beginning of Spring with their arrival. The accompanying National Cherry Blossom Festival is an annual celebration, commemorating the March 27, 1912, gift to the city of 3,000 Japanese cherry trees from Mayor Yukio Ozaki of Tokyo. Mayor Ozaki donated the trees in an effort to enhance the growing friendship between the United States and Japan and also celebrate the continued close relationship between the two peoples.
