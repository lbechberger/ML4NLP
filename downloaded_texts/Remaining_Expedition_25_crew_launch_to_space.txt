The Soyuz TMA-01M spacecraft launched from Kazakhstan to the International Space Station Thursday with Expedition 25 Astronaut Scott Kelly and Cosmonauts Oleg Skripochka and Alexander Kaleri on board.


The rocket, a Soyuz-FG, launched at 23:10 UTC (5:10 AM Kazakhstan time) and reached orbit in just under ten minutes. The Soyuz launched from the Baikonur Cosmodrome.

The crew members of Soyuz TMA-01M will join fellow Expedition 25 crew members Doug Wheelock, Fyodor Yurchikhin and Shannon Walker aboard the space station on Saturday. Docking is expected to occur at about 8:02 PM EDT (0:02 UTC Sunday) to the Poisk module of the ISS. Upon arrival, the remaining Expedition 25 crew will begin a five month stay aboard the space station.

The Soyuz TMA-01M mission is the 107th flight utilizing the Soyuz spacecraft and the first to utilize digital flight control systems.
