Peter Hammond, a pastor &amp; director at Cape Town Frontline Fellowship, has been charged with assault, after leading his four children on a paintball shooting spree, targeting trick-or-treaters last Halloween.

His 11 year old son had originally been a codefendant, but the charges were recently dropped. As a result, the charges against Hammond have been transferred out of juvenile court. Mr. Hammond will file a plea next month.

Cape Town Frontline Fellowship is an evangelical missionary organization. Peter Hammond is also known for his work as a pro-gun activist, and a number of Chrisitian missionary &amp; anti-islamic books.
