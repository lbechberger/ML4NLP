The Maroochy Chamber of Commerce has defeated the Buderim Cricket Club by 48 runs in their Australia Day Twenty20 cricket match.

Batting first, after losing the toss, the Chamber of Commerce scored slowly in the first few overs but scored around 10 an over for the rest of the match. They were bowled out for 162 off 18.3 overs.

In reply, Buderim batted with some enthusiasm and were on target to win the game within the 20 overs but were bowled out for 114 in 15.2 overs.

Maroochy Mayor Joe Natoli provided some commentary for part of the match. He noted, with a hint of sarcasm that the Mayors XI "failed to qualify" for the match. The lack of sledging was noted by other commentators.

The match was included in an overall Australia Day celebration at Buderim Mountain State School which included Sunshine Coast Idol, kids' rides, barbecues and food stalls.
