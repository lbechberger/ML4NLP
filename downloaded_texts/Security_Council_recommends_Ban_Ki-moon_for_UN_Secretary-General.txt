The United Nations Security Council has recommended the South Korean foreign minister Ban Ki-moon for appointment as the next Secretary-General of the United Nations. The UN General Assembly now has to decide on the appointment. Ban Ki-moon placed ahead of India's Shashi Tharoor, currently UN Under-Secretary-General, in informal voting by the Security Council members.

Ban Ki-moon's recommendation will be presented to the UN General Assembly. 

The current Secretary-General, Kofi Annan, said, in a statement, that he has the "highest respect for Mr. Ban, having had the pleasure of working with him both in his present capacity and when he was Chef de Cabinet to the President of the General Assembly".

Kenzo Oshima, Japanese Ambassador to the United Nations expressed a hope that the Assembly presidency will act rapidly to elect him.
