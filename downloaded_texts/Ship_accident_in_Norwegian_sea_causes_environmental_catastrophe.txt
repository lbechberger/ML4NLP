Cypriot cargo ship "Server" went down in Norwegian territory of the North Sea near the Norwegian city Bergen around 6pm local time on January 12. The ship broke into two parts and the accident is described as a catastrophe for the environment in the area due to a significant fuel oil leak. The oil reached land a short time after the breakdown.

The entire 25-man crew was brought to land around 9pm by a Sea King-helicopter. At noon next day it was reported that 290 tons of heavy fuel oil had leaked out onto the sea. The spilt oil has covered ground along the coast and is reported to be still spreading. A nature reservation area for birds is in imminent danger of pollution.
