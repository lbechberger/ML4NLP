Despite all the attention Russia gets in the world media and despite a resurgence of interest towards Russia in the U.S., there was no English-language publication about the country. Russia! intends to fill this gap, now set to hit bookstores.

However, the approach the publishers chose for this 132-page glossy magazine is somewhat unorthodox. On the magazine's website publishers state that most of the names one would expect to find in the publication, such as Maria Sharapova, Leo Tolstoy or Vladimir Putin, are not mentioned in the magazine. The reason for that is, according to the magazine, that "there are much more interesting things about Russia."

In the inaugural issue of Russia! readers can find stories on hidden treasures of Ivan the Terrible, photos of young women chopping wood, discussions of the free speech and homosexuality and photographic journey to Russiaâ€™s far east.

The magazine is published quarterly by Press Release Group, a New York-based marketing and communications company.
