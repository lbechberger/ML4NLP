Billionaire Warren Buffett, Chief Executive of Berkshire Hathaway, auctioned lunch with himself on eBay for US$2.63 million.

Bidding, which started on eBay a few weeks ago, attracted nine bidders, offering huge sums for the opportunity to have a steak lunch with the man said to be a "legendary investor". 

The winning bidder, an anonymous individual, will be parting with $2.63 million for a meal with the world-famed investor and has the opportunity to bring along seven friends for the meal.

This, the latest of Buffett's charity auctions, is providing funds to the Glide Foundation, a charity that provides food, health care, housing and job training for San Francisco's homeless.

Over the last ten years, Buffett has netted $5.9 million in donations through such auctions.
