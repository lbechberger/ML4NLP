The Indian government has raised the budget of the 2010 New Delhi Commonwealth Games from Rs. 767 crore ($163 million) to Rs. 1,620 crore ($344 million). The decision was made at a meeting of the cabinet led by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in New Delhi.

Ambika Soni, the Information and Broadcasting Minister stated, "The cabinet approved the proposal of the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports for providing a revised budget of Rs. 1,620 crore, as loan to the Organising Committee (OC) of the Commonwealth Games, 2010, at the prevailing government rate of interest."

According to the Minister, the organizing board hoped that to generate a net income of approximately Rs. 1,708 crore.

"The components of rent for organising headquarters, technology which were practically nil in the initial budget, are now around Rs. 175 crore and Rs. 200 crore respectively. These have also contributed substantially to the (budget) increase", said the Minister when asked about the reason for the hike. Sponsorships, TV rights and ticketing were other factors influencing the change.

Alongside this, the Queen's Baton Relay will now encompass all the 70 Commonwealth Games Association nations. 

In the international leg, the number of days has been increased to 240 from the previously approved 136 days while on the domestic leg, there has been an increase from 60 days to 100 days.

"The number of volunteers has also gone up to nearly 30,000 and hence the cost of accreditation, catering, uniform, on this account has increased," said Soni.
