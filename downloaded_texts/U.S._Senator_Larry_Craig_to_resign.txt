United States Senator Larry Craig (R-ID) is announcing on September 1 that he will resign his post, effective September 30. Craig was involved in a scandal where he allegedly propositioned another man for sex in a bathroom at a Minneapolis airport. Craig has previously claimed he was "in the bathroom for its intended purpose." The senator said in a news conference that "I am not gay. I have never have been gay," and that he "pleaded guilty to a lesser charge in the hopes that it would go away." This comes just before the Republican National Convention would have called on Craig to resign.
