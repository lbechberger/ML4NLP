At least forty people are reported to have died and another fifty are injured after an accident at a level crossing in Egypt. A truck failed to stop at the crossing near Marsa Matruh, pushing several vehicles waiting ahead of it onto the tracks. 

The train then struck the traffic that was in the way. Two carriages toppled on top of cars, and two more derailed. Thirty-five died at the scene, and five more were pronounced dead in hospital. The death toll has already risen from twenty after more bodies were recovered.

Three vehicles were struck by the service from Matruh to Alexandria, and at least two were crushed underneath it. It is unclear whether the truck was amongst the vehicles hit, or if a bus was involved. A fifth carriage was detached from the train.

Heavy equipment has been dispatched to the scene to remove the carriages, and dozens of emergency vehicles are present. It is feared that more bodies remain in the wreckage. It is unclear if the victims are all Egyptian or if anyone from abroad was on the train.

An investigation has been launched into the disaster, but a witness said that the level crossing is hidden behind a hill, leaving drivers with little time to react.
