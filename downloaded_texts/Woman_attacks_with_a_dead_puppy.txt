A woman that was angry her new Chihuahua had just died entered a dog breeders home and pummeled him on the head with her dead puppy. Lisa Lynn Hopfer was charged with trespassing and third-degree assault with her Chihuahua on the June 7 incident. The 33-year-old woman told police she had taken the puppy to a veterinarian, who said it was only 4 weeks old and needed to be returned to its mother. But before she could return the puppy named Chloe, it died.

Early Wednesday she went to the breeders home and wrestled him as she tried to get down to the basement and take another puppy. Then the breeder got Lisa out of her house and that is when she started to get beaten over the head with a dead Chihuahua. As the woman drove away she waved the dead puppy out of the sunroof and shouted numerous threats at the breeder. 

Police said they are considering felony burglary charges against woman and misdemeanor assault charges.
