Antisa Khvichava, a woman from the country of Georgia, is said to be celebrating her 130th birthday, which would make her the oldest known person on Earth, past or present.

Reportedly born in 1880, documents state that Khvichava picked corn and tea for a living in 1965, at the age of 85. Prior to Khvichava, the record holder for the oldest known person to have lived on the planet was Jeanne Calment of France, who lived to be 122 years old. If confirmed, Khvichava would take the top spot with an eight year lead. The Justice Ministry in Georgia backs up her claim, but it was not independently verified by the Gerontology Research Group and her birth certificate was lost.

Khvichava lives in a small village in Sachino, in the Tsalenjikha district with her entire family, including her 70-year-old son Mikhail, who was apparently born when his mother was 60 years old, 10 of her grandchildren, 12 great-grandchildren and her other six great-great-grandchildren.

"I've always been healthy, and I've worked all my life â€” at home and at the farm," said Khvichava to the Associated Press. Although she spends most of her time in bed, Khvichava can walk without aid, but has some difficulties. Despite her age, her family says she is "clear minded" and can "think rationally."
