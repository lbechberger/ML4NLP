Star Trek star and actor William Shatner has sold his kidney stone for charity.

It has been announced that the actor sold his kidney stone to the online gambling website, GoldenPalace.com for US$25,000. The money will be donated to Habitat for Humanity, a Christian charity organization that builds houses for the poor.

"When I was contacted about selling my kidney stone to GoldenPalace.Com for an original price of US$15,000 I turned it down, knowing that my tunics from Star Trek have commanded more than US$100,000," Shatner said. He said that he countered by offering to sell the ring-sized stone for US$25,000.

Shatner refused selling the stone at an auction or on television. When Jimmy Kimmel interviewed Shatner, he offered to sell it on his show, an offer that Shatner also refused.
