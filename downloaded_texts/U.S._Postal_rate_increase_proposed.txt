The U.S. Postal Service has filed a request with the independent Postal Rate Commission seeking a 2-cent increase in first-class mail. Other types of mail would probably increase as well, with the proposed higher rates taking effect early next year.

First class mail would go from 37 cents to 39 cents; postcards from 23 cents to 24 cents. 

The Postal Service blamed the proposed increase on a 2003 law requiring the agency to place $3.1 billion annually in an escrow account. They said they would withdraw the rate request if Congress changes the law.
