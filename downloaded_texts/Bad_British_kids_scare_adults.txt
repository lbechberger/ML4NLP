Drinks, drugs, violence, promiscuity: British youth at the top or near the top of the bad youth list. And they frighten grown ups.

A report by the Institute of Public Policy Research, to be published next week, describes British youth as among the worst in Europe. The study compares teenage English and Scots with their counterparts in other European countries. 

Fewer British youths ate regularly with their family, and many more spent most evenings with their friends; they were drunk more often, got involved in fights and more had sex than other European youth.

More British adults than Continental adults would be reluctant to intervene should they see youths vandalising a bus shelter fearing a violent response. Many adults were fearful of leaving home after dark and a large number were thinking of moving home because of youths "hanging about".

The demonisation of youth in the British media is said to have induced real fear in many adults.

Many more comparisons are made in this report.
