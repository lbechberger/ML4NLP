Three bombs shook the Indian capital of New Delhi on Saturday in crowded marketplace bazaars within minutes of each other, killing at least 61 people, according to recent reports. The national government is on high alert. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh issued a statement in response to the attack, saying, "India will win the battle against terrorism."

The BBC reports that ten people have been detained in the investigation into the blasts. Police say they are making progress into the investigation and that it appears the same group was behind all three incidents. 

In addition to the reported deaths, 210 people have been injured in the blasts in central and south Delhi, according to recent reports. With Diwali, the Hindu festival of lights being celebrated Tuesday, the bomb blasts have sent ripples across the nation. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh blamed terrorists for the blasts, but verification of responsibility has not occurred. The blasts, first thought to be masterminded by Lashkar-e-Toiba, a group which India claims is supported by Pakistan, were later asserted by a group called "Inquilab". The blast had all the hallmarks of being carried out by well-funded terrorist groups supported by Pakistan, however its foreign ministry said in a statement: "Pakistan strongly condemns the terrorist attacks in Delhi, which have resulted in the loss of a number of innocent lives."

The bombings came just as India and Pakistan were beginning to recover from the shock of this month's Kashmir earthquake.
