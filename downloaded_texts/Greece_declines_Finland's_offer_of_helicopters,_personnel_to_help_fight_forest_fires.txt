Greece has declined Finland's offer of three firefighting helicopters and 25 firefighters.

The offer had been made as a result of a request by Greece for aid with the forest fires Greece is currently experiencing. Greece had stressed at the time that the most urgent need was for fixed-wing aircraft with water-bombing capabilities, assets Finland does not possess.

The Greek authorities said that the equipment Finland had offered was not suited to the task it had been proposed for. Ole Norrback, current Finnish ambassador to Greece, has already said that Finland is in a better position to aid with reforestation efforts once the fires have been quenched.
