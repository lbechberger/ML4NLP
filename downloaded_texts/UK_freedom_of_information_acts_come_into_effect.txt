At the beginning of the calendar year 2005, the United Kingdom Freedom of Information Act went into effect. The act of parliament should allow all citizens of the United Kingdom the freedom to investigate their own records or any data gathered by the government which might affect their lives. However, many within the government have stated that the act will not allow data of importance to national security to be accessed.

The act follows well-received acts in other countries. See Freedom of Information Act on Wikipedia for more background on the history.
