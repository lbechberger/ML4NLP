A bomb explosion on a bus in Myanmar (alternatively Burma) has killed a 55-year-old man and left another man wounded. The explosion occurred yesterday at 8:50 am local time (0220 GMT) as the bus traveled to Yangon, but state media has only posted news of the attack today.

The deceased was identified only as Khant by the New Light of Myanmar, the Burmese government-owned daily newspaper. The article said that the injured man was 46-year-old Pa Pa and that he received a stomach injury. The bus had 35 passengers traveling from Kyaukkyi, and was near Daik Oo, some 85 miles from its destination.

The bombing was blamed on insurgents, but it is unclear which group is responsible. The ruling military junta is subject to attacks from a number of extremist groups opposed to its rule.
