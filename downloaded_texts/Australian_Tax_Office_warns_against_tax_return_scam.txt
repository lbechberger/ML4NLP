The Australian Tax Office (ATO) has warned against a fraudulent email claiming to be from the ATO. The email, which is similar to previous scams, uses the ATO logo and has the subject line of ‘Notification - Please read’, ‘Australian Taxation Office - Please read’ or other variations.

The email directs recipients to a bogus website that looks similar to the ATO website and requests credit card and personal details.

"People should be wary of unsolicited emails claiming to be from the Tax Office," says Tax Commissioner Michael D’Ascenzo.

"As an extra precaution we recommend you type internet addresses directly into your internet browser rather than clicking on links embedded in emails," added D'Ascenzo who also stated that anyone who receives the email should delete it immediately.

Anyone who believes they may have fallen victim to this scam are urged to contact their credit card provider.

The ATO Says that it does not send any unsolicited emails.
