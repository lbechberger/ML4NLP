An informal internet poll by MSNBC showed that a large majority of respondents selected yes to the multiple choice question of whether President George W. Bush should be impeached.

According to the poll question, "Do you believe President Bush's actions justify impeachment?", 87 percent of respondents, so far chose the option that there is "plenty to justify putting him on trial", including "secret spying" and "deceptions leading to war". 

A total of 10.6 percent, so far, stated Bush should not be impeached, with 6.2 percent of total respondents, so far, saying he has done "absolutely nothing wrong" and the other 4.4% agreeing that he may have made a few "missteps" but not the "high crimes and misdemeanors" that calls for an impreachment.

Over 400,000 responses were recorded by Sunday. An online poll is not a scientific survey and may not represent the views of the public at large.

No government officials have commented on this poll at the time of publishing. The poll was on-going as thousands of protesters marched Saturday in Washington D.C asking for an end to the Iraq war. The poll is still "live" and taking votes.
