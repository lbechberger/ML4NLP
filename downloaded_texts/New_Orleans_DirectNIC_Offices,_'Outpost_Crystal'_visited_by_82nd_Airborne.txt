The offices of DirectNIC, a New Orleans based webhost and services provider, were visited by armed members of the 82nd Airborne Division during an interview with Wikinews reporters Tuesday evening. DirectNIC has been the home of "Outpost Crystal" — an information dissemination effort involving hundreds of volunteers throughout the world — since Hurricane Katrina wracked the United States foreign=suppress last Monday.

Armed police and military are currently patrolling the devastated city to protect residents and property. While New Orleans Mayor C. Ray Nagin has ordered a "forced" evacuation of the city, it is not apparent yet whether these orders are being executed by law enforcement agencies. DirectNIC personnel indicate that they will be allowed to stay as they constitute part of the recovery effort of the city.
