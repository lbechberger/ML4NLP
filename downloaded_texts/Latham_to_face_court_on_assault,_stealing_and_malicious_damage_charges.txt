Former Australian opposition leader Mark Latham has been issued with court attendance notices for assault, malicious damage and stealing from person by Campbelltown Police.

The notices follow an altercation between Latham and a Daily Telegraph photographer on January 19.

Police briefs allege that Latham snatched the photographer's camera worth $12,000 and started to walk to his car. 

When the photographer demanded that Latham return his camera, Latham is alleged to have thrown a punch at the photographer, but did not injure him. 

Police later found that the camera had been destroyed.

Sydney's Daily Telegraph said following the incident last month that it intended to claim $12,000 against Latham for damage to a camera carried by its photographer.

Latham is due to appear in Campbelltown Local Court on March 22.
