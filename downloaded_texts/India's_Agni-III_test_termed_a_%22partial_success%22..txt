The Agni III missile launch was not completely successful. The missile developed a snag and fell into the Bay of Bengal sea without hitting the target. Scientists said that they would analyse the scientific data and refire the missile at a later stage. The Indian Defence Minister, Pranab Mukherjee told the Times of India newspaper, "The take-off was successful but there were some problems later," 

India's most sophisticated Intermediate Range Ballistic Missile (IRBM) to date, the Agni III was test-fired off the Orissa coast earlier today. The missile took off from a fixed platform at the Integrated Test Range at Wheeler Island at 11:05 IST (05:35 GMT) in the presence of Defence Minister Pranab Mukherjee and his scientific advisor M. Natarajan.
