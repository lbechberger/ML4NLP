International media attention has been a harsh mistress for 32-year-old Heather Richard of Winnipeg, Manitoba, who gave birth on Sunday while sitting on the toilet. Richard, who believed she was barren and thus assumed she could not be pregnant, thought she was suffering from cramps and a bad bowel movement.

"I kept getting the urge to push and just thought it was a real bad bowel movement," Richard told the Winnipeg Sun, whose interview was picked up by the Canadian wire service. "It just fell out. I thought it was my intestines, so I'm freaking out...but then it's a little boy." Richard realized that the product was a baby and not her insides when its leg twitched.

Relatives of Richard's found her hysterically crying and pointing at the toilet. "She was crying and saying, 'Help me, get my baby out of the toilet, he's drowning," Keith Richard, her cousin, told the Sun. While the rest of the family was immobile by the revelation, police officers knocked on her front door; she was to be arrested due to outstanding warrants that Richard says have since been cleared.

One officer performed CPR on the baby and it was rushed to the hospital. The baby, since named Isaiah, weighed five pounds, nine ounces, and suffered a skull fracture, presumably as a result of his head hitting the toilet bowl. The baby is in stable condition and Richard is recovering from her birth at home.

The incident spread like wildfire in the Canadian and international press on Tuesday and Wednesday. When asked about the coverage, Richard told the website canoe.ca that she was embarrassed at all the fuss the story generated.
