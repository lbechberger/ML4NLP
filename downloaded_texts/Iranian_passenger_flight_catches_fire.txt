Taban Air flight 6437 caught fire as it was landing at Mashhad International Airport in Iran at 7:20 A.M. local time (3:50 GMT) yesterday.

There were no fatalities. 46 people were injured out of 157 passengers and 13 crew members aboard. The flight was scheduled to fly from Abadan to Mashhad, but it made an early landing due to severe weather at the destination and an ill passenger.

As the flight landed amid poor visibility, the plane veered off the runway and gear collapsed, causing the tail to hit the runway. The right wing touched the ground, sheared off, and caught fire. The tail separated after the plane stopped and passengers were evacuated. The runway suffered damage from the tail's impact. It is not clear whether the tail caught fire before or after landing.

The plane involved in the accident was a Tupolev Tu-154 with tail number RA-85787, built in the former Soviet Union.

The Iranian Civil Aviation Authority has suspended Taban Air's license.
