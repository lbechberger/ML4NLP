Reports have surfaced that officials from North Korea may meet with officials from the United States in New York City to talk about the sanctions against North Korea and other problems between the two countries. The meeting may take place sometime next week and is aimed at getting 6-party talks, regarding North Korea's nuclear program, back on track.

Despite the reports by media sources, The White House in Washington D.C. has denied that any plans of the sort exist.

"[We] are not aware of any plans for a meeting," said a spokesman for the White House, Tony Fratto.

Officials at the State Department refused to comment on the reports.

"I cannot comment on the reports," said a spokesman for the State Department, Kurtis Cooper.

On October 31, 2006, officials from the U.S. met with North Korean officials in Beijing, China which led the North Koreans to agree to return to 6-party talks regarding North Korea's nuclear program.
