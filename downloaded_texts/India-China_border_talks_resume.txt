Longstanding border issues will be on the top of the agenda at an upcoming meeting between Chinese premier Wen Jiabao and top India leaders as Wen visit New Delhi this week.

Despite past military conflict, Wen has declared his intention that disputes will not stand in the way of cooperation.

Among the other issues to be discussed are energy cooperation, which many analysts, however, feel may not be as easy to attain as some hope, given the economic competition between the two rising giants.

These events come at a time when the United States has recently announced its intention to help India, a past rival of China, become a "superpower." India has also been planning military expansion/modernization.
