In the Sudan, a peace treaty has been signed that many hope will end the almost 20 year long civil war. 

Rebel leader Dr. John Garang and Sudanese Vice President Ali Osman Mohamed Taha signed the agreement with foreign leaders such as U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell and thousands of members of the public witnessing the event at Nyayo National Stadium in Nairobi, Kenya. The deal will see Sudan's rich oil reserves being split fairly northâ€“south.

The war was between the Muslim north and the Christian south, and over the last two decades has resulted in the death of 1.5 m people. However, this agreement does not solve the separate, more recent and on-going conflict in Darfur. It is hoped this agreement may pave away to a similar treaty to end that conflict.
