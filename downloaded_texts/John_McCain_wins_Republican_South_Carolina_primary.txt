Current Arizona senator John McCain won the South Carolina presidential primary in his bid to become the Republican candidate for President of the United States.

With 97 percent of the votes counted, McCain was announced winner with 33 percent of the votes, followed closely by Mike Huckabee, who had just three percent less.

"I know it's not easy and we've got a long way to go. There are some tough contests ahead," said McCain.

In his concession speech, Huckabee vowed that his campaign will not falter. "The reason that I want to encourage you tonight is to remind you that politics ... is not an event. It is a process. And the process is far, far from over," Huckabee said.

California representative Duncan Hunter, who had less than 1% of the vote, has now dropped out of the race.

The South Carolina primaries largely overshadowed the Nevada caucuses, being held the same day. Earlier that day in Nevada, former Governor Mitt Romney and former First Lady Hillary Clinton won the Republican and Democratic party primaries respectively. This was part of a strange campaign irony, as Nevada will send more delegates to the Republican National Convention in September. South Carolina was stripped of half its delegates after violating party rules by holding a primary contest before Super Tuesday.
