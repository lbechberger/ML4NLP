An anti-war demonstration in the streets of New York City failed to apply for a sound permit, normally granted for public demonstrations of all kinds. As a result of what police claim was an unauthorized use of an amplification device, the New York Police Department took action. Anti-war protester Cindy Sheehan was speaking to a crowd of 150 before the microphone was removed by the authorities, according to a report published in The Village Voice. The organizer of the event, Paul Zulkowitz (nicknamed "Zool"), was arrested moments before the demonstration was dispersed.

Sheehan's speech was almost over Monday when the police interrupted. As Sheehan was escorted off the scene, the crowd shouted at the cops to "let her speak".

Sheehan said that "I was speaking and someone grabbed my backpack and pulled me back pretty roughly," and that "I was shoved around."

She added that "I think their use of force was pretty excessive for someone that didn't have a permit." Mrs Sheehan noted that this happened when police broke up the rally.

The Sheehan tour's previous stop was in downtown Richmond, Virginia where she addressed a small gathering in front of the Virginia Army National Guard office. The small afternoon demonstration drew only a dozen supporters; and as many pro-war demonstrators joined the gathering. 

Sheehan achieved national prominence following her peace vigil at the beginning of August 2005, when she camped in a ditch by a road near United States President George W. Bush's ranch in Crawford, Texas, vowing to stay until the President agreed to meet and speak with her about the Iraq War.
