The Abraham Lincoln Bicentennial Commission in Washington, D.C. has endorsed singer Greg Cherone's children's song "A Man Named Abraham Lincoln". Released in anticipation of Lincoln's birthday, the song is intended to inspire children and adults to learn more about the sixteenth president. "Introducing Lincoln to any child is the reward in itself," says Boston singer-songwriter Cherone.

The Abraham Lincoln Bicentennial Commission was established by Congress to plan a "fitting and proper" national celebration of the 16th president's 200th birthday in 2009. Its members, appointed by the president and congressional leaders, include political leaders, jurists, historians, and collectors. The Commission aims to renew Americans' appreciation of Lincoln's ideals of freedom, democracy, and equal opportunity, and to encourage all people to "live the legacy."
