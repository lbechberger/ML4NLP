The Free State Cheetahs and the Blue Bulls will meet next week in the 2006 Currie Cup final, South Africa's domestic club rugby competition. The Bulls were the first to go through, winning the first semi final against rivals Western Province, and the Cheetahs won their semi against the Sharks.

The Blue Bulls hosted WP at home, at Loftus Versfeld in Pretoria. The Blue Bulls led WP 20 to nine at half time. The gap was closed to 23-16 in the second half, but the home team eventually ran away with the game, in the end, winning 45 points to 23.

At the second semi-final at Bloemfontein, the Cheetahs hosted the Sharks at the Free State Stadium. The Free State were up 17 to nil during the first half. The score was furthered to 24 points, but the Sharks' JP Pietersen scored minutes before the half finished to give the Sharks their first points, and the game went onto halftime, Cheetahs leading 24-7. The Cheetahs held onto the game, winning 30-14.

The Cheetahs will host the final next week, being the highest place finalist (first, the Blue Bulls were second). The final will be the third Blue Bulls/Cheetahs affair in a row, and the fifth Blue Bulls appearance in a row.
