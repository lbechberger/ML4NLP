A former Mexican governor has been killed by gunmen. Silverio Cavazos was shot on the steps of his house in the Mexican state of Colima. 

Cavazos, 41, was transported to hospital where he later died. Cavazos was the governor of Colima from 2005 until November 2009.

Mexican media report Cavazos was standing outside his house with Rafael Gutierrez Villalobos, economic development Secretary for Colima. Villalobas was also wounded in the attack, but reports on his condition have not been released.

Mexican President Felipe Calderon released a statement on Twitter. He said "it is with great sorrow that I extend my condolences to the family of Silverio Cavazos, ex-governor of Colima," and called the shooting a "cowardly murder".

Cavazos was elected as Governor of Colima in February 2005 after the previous Governor, Gustavo Vazquez, died in a plane crash. Colima is a generally peaceful state but has seen a number of recent drug seizures.

In the past year more than twelve mayors and mayors-elect have been killed by drug cartels. Since Calderon has launched his war on drugs, 30,000 people have been killed.
