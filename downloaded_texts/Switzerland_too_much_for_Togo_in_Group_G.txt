Togo were eliminated from the 2006 Fifa World Cup after a 2-0 loss to Switzerland in Group G, Monday.

Well worked moves led to a goal in each half from Alexander Frei and Tranquillo Barnetta.



Despite the relative youth of an outfield of twenty-somethings, and 21-year-old center-back Philippe Senderos who helped shut out the Togolese, the Swiss appeared to be the more organised team.

Togo were lively going forward and individual acts of skill tested the Swiss defence who could not always close down quickly enough. A statistic that showed the game was a bit more even than the scoreline, Togo had seven shots on target to Switzerland's nine.

Switzerland had to soak up a good deal of Togoese pressure and Otto Pfister's side were unfortunate not to have scored.

In the first period Tomas Dossevi had time and space but from 15 yards out he chose to shoot first time and the ball skewed badly wide. Emmanuel Adebayor then ran at speed and wrong-footed a Swiss defender. He fell but Carlos Amarillo declined the penalty appeal.

On the day when the Swiss did go forward they arguably were more ably assisted by a midfield which gave their attack more potency. Though ball possession was split down the middle the Swiss managed a third more shots at goal than the Togolese. This was partly due to 21-year-old right-midfield Barnetta who had a goal and an assist in the game.

The first goal was scored on 17 minutes. Ludovic Magnan sprayed a long ball to the far post, Barnetta intelligently knocked it into the path of Alexander Frei, and the striker, in the center of goal, could not miss from 5 yards.

Two minutes from time Barnetta was rewarded with a goal; he ran on to a pass and drove low across goal. The ball cannoned in off Kossi Agassa's right post.

The result put Switzerland on four points with at least a chance of qualifying for the knock-out stage of the World Cup if they did not lose to Korea Republic in their last Group G game, and certain qualification if they won.
