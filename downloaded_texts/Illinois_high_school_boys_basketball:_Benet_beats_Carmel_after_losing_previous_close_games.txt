On the other side, Carmel's Jon Huisel, who also scored ten points, went up against Kaminsky and "held him in check." Teammate Patrick Cox scored eight points and had five rebounds and three blocked shots.

"But they are a good team," Carmel coach John Ryan said of Benet. "They haven't lost in conference, and I think they beat a good St. Patrick team by 14 points (41–27)."
