Republican Fred Thompson is expected to make his US Presidential bid announcement on Jay Leno's The Tonight Show on Wednesday, September 5th. The appearance will mean Thompson will miss the September 4 Republican debate in New Hampshire.

Thompson's adviser Mary Matalin, appearing Sunday's Meet The Press, said the decision was made because Leno had more people watching than the debates noting, "This is a message-driven campaign, and we want to drive people, and the biggest place to do that was Jay Leno."

Expectations are high for Thompson supporters even though his image was "tarnished by Watergate." While critics think Thompson waited too long declare his intentions, supporters think it will be an advantage.
