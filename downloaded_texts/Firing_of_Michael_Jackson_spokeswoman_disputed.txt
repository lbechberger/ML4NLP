Wrangling between musician Michael Jackson's legal and public relation teams may have yielded its first casualty. Jackson's official website, www.mjjsource.com, reports that Jackson's MJJ Productions has terminated spokeswoman Raymone Bain and public relations firm Davis, Bain, and Associates. On Wednesday, Bain held a press conference amidst a court-issued gag order which she implied was sanctioned by the Jackson legal team. The same day, Jackson's attorney Thomas Mesereau, Jr. released a court-approved terse message: "I have not authorized anyone to speak or hold any press conferences on behalf of Michael Jackson or his family." 

Despite the www.mjjsource.com announcement, late Friday the Associated Press quotes Bain responding, "I have not been fired by Michael Jackson." Bain says she works directly for Jackson himself, not MJJ Productions.

The controversy occurs as Michael Jackson awaits a verdict on charges that he molested a teenage boy in 2003. On Friday, the jury completed its sixth day of deliberations. The twelve jurors will reconvene on Monday.
