Benjamin Mullany, the British man who was shot along with his wife while on holiday in Antigua has died. He and his wife, Catherine had been on the last day of their honeymoon when both were shot during what seems to be a botched robbery on July 29. 

Catherine died instantly while Ben fell into a coma. Doctors were unaware if he knew that his wife did not survive the attack. Ben was flown back to Britain on August 2 after a 22 hour operation to try and save his life. He died at Morriston Hospital, in Swansea, Wales where he remained unresponsive. 

The couple married on July 12 and later flew out to the holiday island. With the death of both Catherine and Ben the murder figures for Antigua have been placed into double figures. Prime minister Baldwin Spencer has asked for Britain's help during the investigation. The suspects are still at large.
