After its first appearance in the 3rd Division, Pavlos Melas Soccer Club finished in the 14th position and was relegated, despite its 2-1 victory over Doxa Dramas Football Club, with 36 points in 32 games. The team from Salonika, Greece will be a serious contender for the championship in the 4th Division. Former Olympiacos SFC player Alekos Tatsis, almost Anderlecht, Belgium's starlet, was released free by OSFC. Pavlos Melas was planning to sign him, but after the relegation, Tatsis probably won't join the "Greens".
