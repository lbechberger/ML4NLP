NATO has said that eight United States service members and an Afghan civilian working for the force were killed on Tuesday after bomb attacks in southern Afghanistan.

The international force added that several troops were also wounded. "Additionally, several service members were wounded in these incidents and were transported to a regional medical facility for treatment," it said.

NATO's International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) said that seven of the killed troops and the Afghan civilian died in the country's southern regions. The eighth US soldier was killed in a separate bombing. The ISAF gave no details as to the exact locations of the incidents.

The deaths came just a day after eleven US troops and three US drug agents were killed in separate helicopter crashes in the country.

This brings the number of US troops killed in Afghanistan to 53 in October, making it the deadliest month in the year.
