The International Olympic Committee has decided to allow women to compete in boxing at the Olympics for the first time. Up until now boxing had been the only sport in which women could not compete. Three weight classes will be created for the women to compete in, with one weight class being dropped from the male schedule. 

President of the IOC Jacques Rogge commented, "Women's boxing has come on a tremendous amount in the last five years and it was time to include them." Gerry Sutcliffe, the British sports minister, said, "The move is a massive boost for women’s boxing." 

Not all were supportive of the inclusion of the women’s ranks. 2004 Olympic silver medallist Amir Khan said, "Deep down I think women shouldn’t fight. That’s my opinion." Despite his comments he said he will be supporting the British competitors at the 2012 Olympics being held in London. 

The inclusion of the women’s classes comes after it was announced in 2005 that both baseball and softball would be excluded form the Olympics after the 2008 games.
