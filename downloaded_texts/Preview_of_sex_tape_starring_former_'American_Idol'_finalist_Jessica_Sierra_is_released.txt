Vivid Entertainment has launched a new website previewing a celebrity sex tape they have obtained staring former American Idol finalist Jessica Sierra.

22-year-old Sierra is a resident of Tampa and reached the final of the show's fourth season in 2005. The film she stars in will be released as a full-length DVD entitled Jessica Sierra Hardcore. The tape shows her having sex with a man thought to be Sierra's boyfriend.

Steven Hirsch, co-chairman of Vivid, who are also responsible for a recent release featuring Kim Kardashian said in a statement, "This title contains the most explicit sex we've ever seen in a celebrity video. Jessica clearly has more talent than just singing."

Vivid spokesperson Jackie Markham has said the footage was created earlier this year and was purchased by the company two months ago from an unidentified third party. Markham said Jessica's attorney has not contacted them and she is unsure if any proceeds will reach Sierra.

The tape also shows her making abusive comments about other contestants, such as Carrie Underwood, who has gone on to have some success.
