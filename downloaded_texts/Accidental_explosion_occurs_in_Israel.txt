An explosion occurred at the Rafael Arms Development Authority in Kiryat Bialik, Israel today.

At least six people have been injured including police officers and medics. Rescue services say the injuries range from "moderate" to "light."

The explosion is not believed to be terror related. "We are not talking about a suicide attack. It is a work accident. We don't know exactly what, a chemical that blew up in a bottle," said Moshe Weizman, a regional police spokesman.

Rafael makes electronic warfare systems, missiles and tank armor.
