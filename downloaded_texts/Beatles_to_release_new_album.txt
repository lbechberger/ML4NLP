Sir George Martin and his son Giles are reported to be working on a new Beatles album, which is scheduled to be released by The Beatles' company Apple Corps through EMI Music later this year. 

The album will be based on the new show by Cirque du Soleil, entitled LOVE, which will feature remixed versions of The Beatles' songs. Some observers have stated that the album, which is being put together from the original master recordings, may well be the closest thing to an original Beatles album since the legendary band's break up. 

The album will be released in November.
