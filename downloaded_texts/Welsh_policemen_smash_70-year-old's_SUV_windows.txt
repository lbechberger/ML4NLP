Two police officers in Gwent, Wales have been taken off duty after they allegedly smashed the windows of an SUV.

One officer supposedly struck a window with his baton, while the other jumped on the bonnet (hood) and kicked the windshield.

The driver, 70-year old Robert Whatley, was stopped for not wearing his seatbelt September 9, 2009. 

A retired businessman from Usk, Whatley is a stroke victim and takes medication for his heart condition. He was driving away while he was being issued a fixed penalty notice. He thought that the police were finished with him, and he needed his medication, he told Caerphilly magistrates court. He was convicted of motoring offences today at the conclusion of a two-day trial but cleared of failure to stop after an accident. It had been alleged he struck an officer with his car as he drove away.

Deputy Chief Constable Carmel Napier said "Gwent Police expects the highest professional standards of its police officers and police staff at all times and we can assure Mr. Whatley and the public that this matter will be thoroughly investigated."
