Andry Rajoelina, the leader of Madagascar, announced that he will not run in elections due to be held later this year. He stated his reason as an attempt to end the countryâ€™s political crisis. Rajoelina has been pressured to find a solution to the crisis. 

At the same time as his announcement not to run as a candidate, he announced the planned dates for both the parliamentary and presidential elections. The parliamentary elections were announced for September, with the presidential election following in November. 

Rajoelina announced his decision on television, saying: "I declare in the name of the superior interest of the nation and of the people, my decision not to stand as candidate in the presidential elections for a fourth republic." 

During the crisis Rajoelina has come under more pressure. Aid was cut off by donors, and former military allies, who backed him during his coup, began to turn on him. The African Union have also imposed sanctions on the country. 

Madagascar was previously ruled by France. French secretary of state for co-operation Alain Joyandet released a statement saying that it "demonstrated a sense of responsibility".
