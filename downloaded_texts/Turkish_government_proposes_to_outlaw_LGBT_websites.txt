A proposal by the Turkish government to the Grand National Assembly of Turkey is threatening online gay rights in Turkey. If the proposal is accepted, Turkish websites through which the Turkish LGBT community socializes will be closed and prohibited. According to the press release by Lambda Istanbul, a Turkish LGBT organization, the words "Lesbian", "Gay", "Bisexual", "Transgender" (LGBT) and "Transsexual" are already banned from Turkish internet cafes.
