A fresh, 6.3 magnitude earthquake struck the South Pacific again on Friday. The tremors were felt in Tonga and Samoa, which are still reeling after a stronger earthquake and tsunami struck the area several days earlier.

According to the US Geological Survey, the tremors began underwater at 02.46 GMT on Friday, with the epicentre about 242 kilometres off of the Tongan island of Neiafu, at a depth of ten kilometres. The earthquake is among the dozens of aftershocks that occurred in the region since Tuesday's big quake.

No damage and casualties from that earthquake have been reported, and the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center did not issue a tsunami warning.

Experts did not think it likely that the earthquake would cause any tsunamis. "I don't think there is a particular tsunami danger from that earthquake," said seismologist Phil Cummins to the Agence France-Presse news agency.
