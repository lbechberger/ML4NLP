Traralgon went within a game and percentage of ladder leader Maffra with a 118 point victory over Warragul in their round 14 Gippsland Football League match. However, 24 hours later, Maffra defeated Sale by 44 points. 

The Gippsland Football League, officially the Gippsland League, is the only major Australian rules football competition in the Gippsland region, according to the Victorian Country Football League.

Warragul kicked both of its goals in the first half, still conceivably in the contest at that point thanks to Traralgon's inaccurate seven goals and ten behinds. The hosts kicked five goals in the third quarter to extend their lead to ten goals.

At the end of the day, Traralgon won 20-13 (136) to Warragul's 2-6 (18).

Drouin played Morwell in the other match played on Saturday. On Sunday, Maffra hosted Sale in Maffra, and Moe hosted Wonthaggi in Morwell to complete the round.
