There will be a full lunar eclipse starting on Saturday, March 3. Earth's passage between the Sun and the Moon will begin casting its shadow on the surface of the Moon starting at 20:18 UTC. The Moon will be totally eclipsed by the Earth's shadow between 22:44 and 23:58 UTC.

Cloudless conditions would make for a great viewing experience as the Lunar phase is now full. The color of the moon will be like that of copper.

In England, the lunar eclipse will occur between 8:18pm and until 2:24am.

A chart to calculate the time offset from UTC puts the eclipse starting at 3:18pm EST in North America. The moon will be totally eclipsed 21 minutes prior to sunset in that time zone. The moonrise will occur during the period it is eclipsed, at 6:01pm. Viewers will be able to see the moon re-emerge from the Earth's shadow, weather permitting.

The eclipse will take place during the Hindu festival of Holi.
