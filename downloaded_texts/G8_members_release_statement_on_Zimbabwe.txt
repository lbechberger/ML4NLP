A statement has been released by member states of the G8 expressing 'grave concern' over the current situation in Zimbabwe.

In the first section of the statement, the leaders wrote that they "deplore the fact that the Zimbabwean authorities pressed ahead with the presidential election despite the absence of appropriate conditions for free and fair voting as a result of their systematic violence, obstruction and intimidation." Furthermore, the G8 member nations noted that they do "not accept the legitimacy of any government that does not reflect the will of the Zimbabwean people."

The statement continued by asking for the opposition party Movement for Democratic Change to co-operate with ZANU-PF, the party in power. "We strongly urge the Zimbabwean authorities to work with the opposition to achieve a prompt, peaceful resolution of the crisis," they said. They did, add, however, that "it is important that any mediation process respect the results of the March 29, 2008 election. "

In addition, the G8 members expressed concern at the humanitarian situation in the country. "Zimbabwean authorities must allow the immediate resumption of humanitarian operations and full and non-discriminatory access to humanitarian assistance to prevent the suffering of the most vulnerable people in Zimbabwe."

The G8 summit is an annual gathering of the leaders of France, the United States, the United Kingdom, Russia, Germany, Japan, Italy and Canada. This year, the 34th G8 summit took place in TÅ�yako, Japan.
