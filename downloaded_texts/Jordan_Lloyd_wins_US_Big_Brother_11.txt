Jordan Lloyd has won the eleventh season of the American version of reality TV show Big Brother on Tuesday.

Lloyd, 22, from Matthews, North Carolina, was a waitress prior to entering the Big Brother house. In a twist she was in the Popular clique with fellow HouseGuests Braden Bacha and Laura Crosby who were evicted in the first two weeks. During the course of the show, she was very close to Jeff Schroeder from the Athletes clique. 

On the finale night she won the final Head of Household competition securing her place in the final two. Lloyd won the grand prize of US$500,000 with five votes from the jury, beating Natalie Martinez's two votes. Lloyd received the votes of viewing public, Jessie Godderz, Lydia Tavera, Schroeder, and Michele Noonan to win. Due to Chima Benson's expulsion earlier in the season, the viewing public voted during the final week for who should win the final jury vote. Executive producer Allison Grodner noted in a post finale interview that while she didn't know the final percentage votes Lloyd was in the 90th percentile in both scenarios she was in.

CBS, the channel which has been showing Big Brother in the United States for the last ten years, recently announced the pickup of Big Brother 12 for the summer of 2010.
