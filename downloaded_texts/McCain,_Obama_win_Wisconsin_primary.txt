John McCain and Barack Obama have won the Wisconsin Primary, MSNBC and CNN have reported. John McCain won among the Republicans and remains the presumptive GOP nominee, while Obama and Clinton are in a close race on the Democratic side for the national nomination.

"I will fight every moment of every day in this campaign to make sure Americans are not deceived by an eloquent but empty call for change," McCain said. He added a comment that The New York Times saw as directed toward Obama: "The peals of change that ignore the lessons of history and lack confidence in the intelligence and ideals of free people."
