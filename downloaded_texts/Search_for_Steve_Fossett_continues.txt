The search has today continued for adventurer Steve Fosset, 63, who went missing recently after his plane went missing in the US. He was last seen in his single engined plane at an airfield in Nevada. His plane is thought to have come down in densely wooded land to the south of the airfield.

The tracking beacon signals in the rescue kit of the plane have not been located however the rescue effort has been continuing by the use of many planes and thermal imaging cameras.

Close friend Sir Richard Branson has not yet given up hope, however rescuers have been describing the task as "like finding a needle in a haystack".

Steve is well known for his record attempts including becoming the first person to fly round the world in a hot air balloon.
