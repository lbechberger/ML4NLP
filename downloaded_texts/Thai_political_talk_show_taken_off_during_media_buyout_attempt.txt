Thailand's popular political talk show, Muang Thai Rai Sapda has been dropped by Channel 9. Hosted by Sondi Limthongkul, the show was notorious for its criticism of the Thai government. This happens as much of Thai media is being bought by a government-allied media conglomerate, GMM.

Sondhi, the presenter, and founder of a popular magazine, Pujatkran (Eng: Manager), accused the network of making a politically motivated decision.
