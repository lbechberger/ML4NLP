In Bahrain, two unnamed United States Navy sailors were killed and one other was seriously injured when they were shot inside their barracks at around 5:00 a.m. (UTC+3) at a naval base located in Bahrain. The Navy has stated that the incident is isolated and is not considered an act of terrorism.

The injured sailor was taken to a hospital to receive medical attention, while the two dead sailors were pronounced dead at the scene of the crime.

So far reports say that all involved parties are American and that the incident was a "domestic" dispute between at least two female U.S. Navy sailors.

Bahrain is home to the Fifth Fleet which is part of the U.S. Naval Forces Central Command. At least 3,000 sailors are stationed there, but that number does not include the troops on ships currently docked at the Mina Sulman pier.
