A 13-year-old male student, Clay Moore, from Parrish, Florida, was abducted at gunpoint earlier this morning shortly before 9:00 AM while waiting for his school bus with about 15 other students. A male believed to be around 30 years old and reportedly between 5 feet, 7 inches and 5 feet, 8 inches, drove up and motioned him into his faded red extended-cab pickup truck. Witnesses reported that Moore, a student at Manatee School for the Arts, told the unknown abductor, "Sir, I don't know you." before leaving with the man, who looked Hispanic or like a white male "with a dark tan". A student on the scene called 911 to inform the authorities of the abduction. An Amber Alert was put out for Moore, who is about 5 feet tall and was wearing a Manatee School for the Arts jacket over a green polo shirt.

Clay Moore was found later, near Kibbler Ranch off of State Road 64, according to Sheriff Charlie Wells, with no visible injuries. He used a cell phone to call his mother and tell her that he was safe. "We believe it was somebody else's cell phone, somebody that was rendering aid to him, and allowed him to use the phone," Wells said.

The abductor has not been located as of now, but the authorities are investigating.
