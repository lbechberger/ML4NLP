A song proclaiming that United States president-elect Barack Obama is Irish has got more than 600,000 views on video sharing site YouTube, with many of those views coming after he was elected on November 4.

"O'Leary, O'Reilly, O'Hare and O'Hara, There's no one as Irish as Barack O'Bama," states the song. "You don't believe me, I hear you say. But Barack's as Irish, as was JFK. His granddaddy's daddy came from Moneygall, a small Irish village, well known to you all".

Moneygall is located on the border of the Irish county of Offaly. It is primarily residential although it also features open space around the edge of the village and non-residential buildings in the centre. The village has one main road, and a few smaller roads leading out of it.

Obama, who won the recent U.S. election as the Democratic presidential nominee, won 360 electoral votes, more than enough to clinch the Presidency of the United States. He is the first African American to be elected President in U.S. history.
