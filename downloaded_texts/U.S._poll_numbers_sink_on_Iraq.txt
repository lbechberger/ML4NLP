A CBS opinion poll has reported that 55% of Americans disapprove of the United States' position in the War in Iraq. A separate poll published by The Pew Research Center found that 43% of Americans supported an immediate withdrawal of US troops from Iraq, an increase from 36% of Americans who were polled last October.

In addition, an Ipsos/Associated Press poll of 1,000 Americans showed that 47% of those polled have a "strong disapproval" of the way George W. Bush has been handling the war, compared to 21% who "strongly approve".
