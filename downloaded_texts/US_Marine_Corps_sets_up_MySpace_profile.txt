The most popular social networking site, MySpace.Com has a new user: The United States Marine Corps.

Until now over 12,000 MySpace.com users have signed on as “friends” of the Marine Corps whose profile, features streaming video of fresh recruits enduring boot camp and Marines storming beaches.

It underscores the growing significance of the Internet to advertisers as a means for reaching America’s youth. Recruiters say that they would never sign someone up to join the Marines unless they've met him or her in an old-fashioned, face-to-face meeting.

Gunnery Sergeant Brian Lancioni says "this is definitely the new wave since everything's technical with these kids."
