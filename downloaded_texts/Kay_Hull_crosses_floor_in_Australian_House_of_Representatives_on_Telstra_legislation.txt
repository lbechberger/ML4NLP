Kay Hull, an Australian National Party member of Parliament representing the electorate of Riverina, crossed the floor September 15 at the final third reading stage of debate on the Telstra legislation, previously passed and returned to the Australian House of Representatives.

Hull was the only MP who did so; the legislation passed the third reading on a majority of seventeen votes. 

Hull was praised by the Manager of Opposition Business, Julia Gillard in the adjournment debate, stating "We have seen the National Party at its worst â€” with the notable exception of the Member for Riverina".
