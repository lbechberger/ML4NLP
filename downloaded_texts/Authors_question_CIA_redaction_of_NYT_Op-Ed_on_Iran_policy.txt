A New York Times Op-Ed by former National Security Council senior director for Middle East affairs Flynt Leverett and his wife Hillary Mann regarding the United States' Iran policy by Flynt Leveret and Hillary Mann was redacted by the Publication Review Board of the CIA, at the behest of the White House the authors said. The authors noted in another op-ed the same day that "the deleted portions of the original draft reveal no classified material .... all of the material the White House objected to is already in the public domain".
