A huge sinkhole in the earth swallowed about a dozen houses in a poor neighborhood of the capital of Guatemala. Three people died when the 330-ft-deep hole opened up on February 23. The police decided to evacuate some 1,000 people in the Guatemala City neighborhood.

The bodies of Domingo Irma and David Soyos were recovered from the hole and surrounding sewage water.

Officials speaking to the AP blamed recent rains and a ruptured sewage main for the massive hole.
