The New Zealand Parliament met today for the first time following the recent general election.

Three senior judges, led by Chief Justice Sian Elias, formally opened the session.

The members were formally sworn in, and the National Party took control of the government benches. National MP Lockwood Smith was unanimously elected Speaker.

Parliament will reconvene tomorrow for the formal state opening by the Governor-General, and the speech from the Throne, in which the government will lay out its legislative programme.

The November 8 election saw National win a victory over the Labour Party and form a minority government with the support of ACT and the MÄ�ori Party.
