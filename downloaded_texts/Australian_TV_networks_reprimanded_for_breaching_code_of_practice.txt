Australian networks Seven and Ten have been reprimanded by broadcast regulators the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) for inaccurate and unfair reporting. 

The networks were found to have breached the Australian Commercial Television Code of Practice on two counts, following a scuffle outside a court in Melbourne in April 2010, when a cameraman for Channel Nine, Simon Fuller, called Gad Amr, the father of an accused rioter, a terrorist.

The Australian Human Rights Commission claimed the networks gave the impression Mr Amr suddenly lost his temper with Fuller about filming his son Omar. The ACMA found them in breach of the commercial television code of practice, not reporting accurately and fairly, by showing the confrontation without disclosing the provoking “terrorist” comment made by Fuller. 

The networks also did not disclose Mr Amr had asked Fuller repeatedly to stop filming — 25 times, as counted by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's Media Watch. 

The ACMA ruled they were not in breach of the code in portrayal of race, ethnicity, or religion. 

Last week the ACMA ruled Seven had broken regulations by showing a McDonald's advertisement during children's programming.
