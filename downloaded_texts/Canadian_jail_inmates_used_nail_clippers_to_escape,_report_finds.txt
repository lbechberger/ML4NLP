According to a government report released on Tuesday, six inmates of a Regina, Saskatchewan jail managed to escape last summer after spending four months using nail clippers and other makeshift instruments to break out.

The report stated that no fewer than 87 prison guards had supervised the inmates' unit, but did not discover the prisoners' escape plans.

The inmates, four of whom had faced murder charges, used the instruments to remove a steel plate and grill, and finally break through with a shower rod, reaching an exterior brick wall. The inmates used sheets and blankets to climb up the exterior walls of the compound.

Some of the prisoners played cards at a table in the corridor to block the guards' view.

The prisoners were later caught and sent back to prison. "We didn't think we would get away with it. We started working on it. It was something to do and we just kept at it. When we didn't get caught, we picked our night and just went," said one of the escapees to the team investigating the incident.
