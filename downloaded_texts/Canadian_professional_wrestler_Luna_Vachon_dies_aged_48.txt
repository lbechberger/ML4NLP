Former professional wrestler and manager Luna Vachon has died at the age of 48. The cause of death was not announced. Vachon wrestled for World Wrestling Entertainment, formerly World Wrestling Federation between 1993 and 2000. 

At the time of her death, the Canadian-born Vachon was living with her mother in Florida after a fire at her house destroyed all of her possessions including her wrestling memorabilia. Her death was announced by family and friends. 

Vachon wrestled for several wrestling promotions including the World Wrestling Federation (WWF), World Championship Wrestling and the now defunct Extreme Championship Wrestling. As well as performing as a wrestler, she also appeared as a manager for several superstars. After appearing for the WWF on and off between 1993 and 2000 Vachon was released from her contract. 

Former employers World Wrestling Entertainment posted a statement about the death of Vachon on their website. They said "World Wrestling Entertainment has been made aware of the passing of Gertrude (Luna) Vachon. WWE extends its deepest condolences to the Vachon family. Ms. Vachon was under contract with WWE at various times from 1993 through 2000, and performed under the name 'Luna' Vachon. She last performed for WWE in early 2000."

Fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna. Tommy Dreamer said "Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. My first manager. Luna passed away on the night of two moons. Pretty unique just like her. Strong woman." Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was as freaky as me...maybe even more...love her and will miss her...hopefully she's in a better place."

Vachonâ€™s death has come shortly after the death of former World Wrestling Entertainment wrestler Lance Cade who died at the age of 29.
