Al-Qaeda in Iraq has released video of Sudanese hostages that members of the organization have kidnapped last week.

The video indicates that the militants intend to kill five kidnapped employees of the Sudanese Embassy in Baghdad in two days unless the Sudanese government removes its diplomatic mission from Iraq. Sudan has announced that it will abandon its embassy today, apparently in a bid to free the hostages.
