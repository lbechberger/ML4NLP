Garth Turner Member of Parliament (MP) for Halton, has joined the Liberal Party of Canada after months of being an Independent MP.

Turner was elected with the Conservative Party of Canada in the January 2006 election, but was suspended in October from the Party after posting critical blog posts. After, there was some speculation the he would join the Green Party, which has 0 elected MPs in Ottawa, the nations capital.


"Garth Turner is an exceptional Member of Parliament, known across Canada for his passion and accomplishments," said Liberal leader Stéphane Dion speaking in Ottawa today with Turner. "He is an outspoken advocate for fiscal prudence, progressive values and environmental sustainability, and I know Mr. Turner’s constituents of Halton will only be better served by his decision today."

"As a former Progressive Conservative MP and Cabinet Minister, I believe in being careful on money issues, but also generous on social ones," said Mr. Turner. "I have found Mr. Harper’s party to be too far right for my community of Halton, while the Liberal Party of Stéphane Dion now closely reflects those progressive values I’ve always believed in."

Now there is only one independent MP in the House of Commons being André Arthur for the riding of Portneuf—Jacques-Cartier in French speaking Quebec.

Turner now has a video posted on Google Video. He talks about joining the Liberals. See external links section below to watch.

In the video he says the Conservatives have an extreme right-wing agenda. He also adds that it is better to be in a Party than being independent.
