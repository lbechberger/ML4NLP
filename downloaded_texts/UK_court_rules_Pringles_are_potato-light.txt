A British High Court judge has ruled that Pringles are not a potato snack and therefore not subject to a 17.5% tax.

The judge, Justice Nicholas Warren, overruled a Value Added Tax (VAT) Tribunal decision that imposed the 17.5% tax which is also applied on other potato products.

Pringles' owner Procter &amp; Gamble had claimed at a ruling in May that Pringles do not feel, look, or taste like a crisp. Justice Warren ruled that since Pringles are only 42% potato, it is exempt from VAT.
