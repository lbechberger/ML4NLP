On Sunday, Novak Djokovic defeated seven-time champion Roger Federer 7–6, 6–7, 6–4, 6–3 to win the 2015 Wimbledon Championships men's singles, which is overall his third Wimbledon trophy of his career. Djokovic, who is ranked world number one in men's tennis, has now won a total of nine Grand Slam titles. 

Djokovic won the first set 7–6 with 6 aces in total. Federer snatched the second set 7–6 in his favour, that too with 6 aces. The Serbian Djokovic had only 16 as compared to Federer's 35 unforced errors. Completing the third and fourth sets 6–4 and 6–3, Djokovic ruined the chance of Federer winning the championship for an eighth time, a feat nobody has ever accomplished to date.

The match was completed in two hours and 56 minutes. After the match, Federer said "I had my chances in the first set. I got lucky to win the second, had chances in the third. But he was better on the bigger points. He was rock solid, I didn't play badly myself. That's how it goes."

This was Djokovic's 48th victory in 2015.
