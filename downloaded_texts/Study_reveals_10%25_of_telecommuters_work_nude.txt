A survey by SonicWALL, a Sunnyvale, California-based company, reports that 10% of worldwide telecommuters are nude while working, finding 12% for men and 7% for women, respectively.

A gender gap also exists for showering on work-at-home days, with 44% of women showering, while only 30% of men did. The survey also found that 39% of both sexes wear sweats while working from home.

The survey also covered less racy topics, including opinions on productivity. 76% felt that working at home increased productivity.

The number of telecommuters has increased sharply in recent years. For example, 43% of U.S. government employees telecommute at least part of the time, up from only 19% one year ago.
