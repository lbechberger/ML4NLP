Three foreign journalists in South Africa have been robbed at gunpoint while they slept in their chalet in Magaliesburg, Gauteng. The reporters were in South Africa to cover the FIFA World Cup, a football competition which starts on June 11.

Police spokesman Hangwani Mulaudzi confirmed that two gunmen broke into the journalists' lodgings during the early hours of the morning. One of the journalists woke during the break-in and was forced to lie on the floor by one of the suspects. Laptops and cameras were stolen, along with the reporters' passports. 

The South African Press Association reported that two of the journalists were Portuguese and another was from Spain. None of the journalists were harmed during the incident. 

Thousands of police officers have been organised for the World Cup. Around 350,000 fans are due to visit South Africa during the tournament.
