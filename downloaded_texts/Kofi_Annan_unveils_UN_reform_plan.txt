UN Secretary General Kofi Annan will formally present a plan this morning to the UN General Assembly when it meets in New York later today. The plan, entitled In Larger Freedom, is part of the UN's attempt to revitalise itself during its sixtieth anniversary year.

If implemented, this plan will be the largest change ever to the international body, calling for the addition of nine members to the Security Council, and for the creation of a new Human Rights Council to replace the 53-member Human Rights Commission.

The Canadian ambassador to the UN, Allan Rock, was the first diplomat to officially respond by saying, "A lot of hard work lies ahead but we are optimistic." Oxfam, Amnesty International, and other NGOs, have come out in support of the plan.
