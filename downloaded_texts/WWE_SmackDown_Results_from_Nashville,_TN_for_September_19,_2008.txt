Up-and-coming WWE star Vladimir Kozlov came to Nashville, TN on Tuesday night with an agenda. "I want better competition," the former sambo champion from Ukrane said last week. "If you will not give it to me, then I will find it myself." 

Kozolv has done just that, and he started his quest by attacking the top contender for the WWE Championship, Jeff Hardy, at the end his match last week. Hardy would again be the target for Kozlov's frustrations, but he would not be alone. Hardy had just won a hard-fought match against Brian Kendrick, as he was walking up the stage, he turned around to wave to the fans. As Hardy turned around to go backstage, he was surprised by Kozlov with a stiff kick to the chest. The blow left Hardy on the stage, gasping for breath, he would be carried away by medical staff during a commercial break. 

Later in the evening, it would be WWE Champion Triple H who would become the new target. After Triple H defeated Montel Vontavious Porter in the main event match, Vladimir Kozlov would ambush the champion as he was celebrating in the ring. Triple H, no stranger to being attacked unprepared, quickly retaliated and appeared to have the rookie handled. Kozlov was able to hold his own, and brought down the champion with a vicious head butt. As Triple H laid on the mat knocked out, Kozlov mouthed the words, "The end is near for you." 

Vladimir Kozlov received word shortly before this second attack that his wish for tougher competition would be answered. If he wants a shot at the WWE Champion, he will have to first go through another former champion, the 7'3" Great Khali. 

In other events, the reigning WWE Tag Team Champions were also looking for competition. Curt Hawkins and Zach Ryder made an impromptu appearance during Carlito's Cabana as host Carlito Colon was introducing the fans to his younger brother, WWE newcomer Primo Colon. The brothers from Puerto Rico had won their first match as a tag team last week. Hawkins and Ryder came down to the ring and picked a fight with the Colon brothers, challenging them to a match next week. It appeared that the tag team champions were leaving the ring, but when the Colon brothers turned their backs to leave as well, they were attacked by Hawkins and Ryder. Jesse and Festus Dalton came down to the ring to break the scuffle up.
