Robert Wilson, the bassist for funk group The Gap Band, has died at the age of 53. Wilson’s death was announced by his manager and publicist, Don Jackson. He died in Los Angeles on Sunday night. The cause of death was announced as a massive heart attack. 

Born in Tulsa, Wilson formed funk and R&amp;B group The Greenwood, Archer and Pine Street band with his brothers, Charlie and Ronnie. They later shortened the name to The Gap Band to make it stand out on gig posters.

The group had reached success by the time Wilson was 14. Hits by the brothers included "I Don’t Believe You Want to Get Up and Dance (Oops)", "Party Train" and "You Dropped a Bomb on Me", which was later included in the 2004 hit videogame, Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas.

Wilson, who had been touring at the time of his death, returned to his hometown of Tulsa last week. He told newspaper Tulsa World that he would be headlining the Timeless Music Festival on August 28. Sources have said that it is likely the festival will become a tribute show to Wilson.

Funeral arrangements have remained private and have not been announced.
