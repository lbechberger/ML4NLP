Technology giant Sony is reportedly looking into cutting prices on Playstation 3 gaming consoles. 

Even though Sony loses about (U.S.) $200 for each unit sold, the company believes that selling units for less will increase sales of games and peripherals, which is apparently where the company makes the most profit. By reducing prices on Playstation 3 units, Sony's gaming division is looking to break even by 2008. 

The report is not indicative that Sony will reduce the price of the console, only that it is looking into doing so.
