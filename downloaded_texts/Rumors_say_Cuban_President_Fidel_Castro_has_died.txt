Rumors began circulating today in Miami, Florida that Fidel Castro, the President of Cuba, may be dead. The rumor has been reported to have started on Wall Street in New York City.

PerezHilton.com was the first to "break" the news, saying that an official announcement on Castro's death would be coming at 2:00 p.m. (local time), but no announcements were made and there has been no confirmations of his death.

Castro turned 81 on August 13 and shortly after, reports began to circulate that his health was on a downward track, but the Cuban government states that Castro is doing well.

"Fidel is doing very well" and is "disciplined in his recovery process," said Felipe Perez Roque, Cuba's Foreign Minister in a statement to the press.
