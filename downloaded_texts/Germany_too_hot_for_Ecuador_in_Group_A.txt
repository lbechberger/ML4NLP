Germany made light of heat and humidity to brush Ecuador aside 3-0 in their final Group A match, Tuesday.

The Germans got goals from Miroslav Klose, whose two tallies put him top of the Fifa World Cup scorers chart with four goals, and Lukas Podolski, his first at the competition.



Luis Suarez's side had 57 per cent of ball possession but Jens Lehmann had to make just two saves from Edison Mendez's and Edwin Tenorio's 35 yard efforts.

After the third goal what there was of a contest ended. This was partly because both sides had already achieved qualification through to the round of sixteen and wanted to conserve energy. 

It also was 27 degrees Celsius in the Olympiastadion and together with the 65 per cent humidity playing at a fast pace for a long time was difficult.

The first goal came on three minutes. Bastian Schweinsteiger brought down a cross level with goal and cut it back to Klose. The Polish born striker finished neatly across Cristian Mora from the edge of the six yard box.

Ecuador were no big threat going forward and had rested Carlos Tenorio, Augustin Delgado and Ivan Hurtado, the captain, for the game. Marlon Ayovi was Ecuador's captain against Germany.

Germany's second was set up by Michael Ballack. His brilliant chip surprised two Ecuador defenders and Klose stole in between them and before the advancing Mora to score.

In the second half there was no hurry to the German game, Ecuador had much of the possession, but Klinsmann's team looked a constant threat on the break. On one such fast attack Bernd Schnieder on the right wing crossed low for Podolski who slid in and tipped the ball toward the far post.

Germany and Ecuador had to wait on the outcome of the Group B match between Sweden and England to know their next opponents. The winner of Group A would play the runner-up in Group B and vice versa.
