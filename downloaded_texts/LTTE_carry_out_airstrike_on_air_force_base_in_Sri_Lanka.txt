Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) rebels bombed an Sri Lankan air force base in Katunayake in their first ever aerial attack on government forces.

At least two aircraft attacked the base on Monday at 00:45 hours local time. As many as 3 members of the air force were killed, and 17 injured during the attack when at least 2 bombs were dropped on the base. There are no reports of any air force jets being damaged or destroyed.



"The situation was brought under total control. The government vehemently condemns the cowardly attempt to attack the Katunayake air force camp in the aftermath of the major defeats suffered by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in the north and east," said a statement by the Media Center for National Security.

No casualties or damage have been reported from the neighbouring Bandaranaike International Airport, which is Sri Lanka's only international airport.

"No security threat prevailed to the commercial flights and passengers," added the statement.

Rebels released a statement following the attack warning of more bombings.

"It is a measure to protect Tamil civilians from the genocidal aerial bombardments by Sri Lankan armed forces. More attacks of the same nature will follow," said Rasiah Ilanthiraiyan, a spokesman for the rebel group. 

In 2001, a ground attack by the LTTE on Bandaranaike International Airport left nearly half of national carrier SriLankan Airlines' fleet destroyed.
