Teguh Samudro the head of BKIMP, the Indonesian quarantine said yesterday: "The packages were broken when they arrived at the airport, so we could tell what was inside"; "We don't know where they were being sent as the address on the package does not exist". He noted the turtles are to be returned shortly to their native Papua habitat.

He went on to say that, "Violators of the 1992 law on animal, fish and plant quarantines or the 1990 law on biodiversity and ecosystem conservation face up to three yearsâ€™ imprisonment and fines of up to Rp 150 million (US$15,400)."
