Wednesday, Spanish LW10-2 classified sit skier Nathalie Carpanedo finished her wild card run at the IPC Alpine World Championships competing as a member of the Spanish team in the international team friendly held the day after the closing ceremonies for the World Championships. Carpanedo's team finished tenth in a field of ten teams, which saw the Austria finish first, team 1 for the United States finish second, and Russia finish third.

Carpanedo started the day with 232.13 International Paralympic Committee Alpine Skiing points, and finished her team race with a time of 26.46 seconds. Because teammate Úrsula Pueyo had a faster time of 20.32, Carpanedo's time was not used in tabulating Spain's overall ranking as only one time by a female skier was required.

Beyond Wednesday's event, Carpanedo competed in two individual races at the Championships. Her first was the , where she earned a Did Not Finish in her first run. 36 of the 116 competitors had the same result in that race. Her other race, the , saw her finish in tenth in the women's sitting group with a combined run time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes slower than first place finisher Austrian Claudia Loesch and 1:09.02 minutes slower than the ninth place finisher Gyöngyi Dani of Hungary. Four skiers in the women's sitting group failed to finish their runs, and 45 of the 117 total skiers in the Giant Slalom failed to rank in the race.

Carpanedo is one of the founding member of the first women's disability ski team in Spain. Created with the support of Teresa Silva, Fundación También insisted the team be for women to encourage their participation in disability sport. Fundación También supports a number of other sports including bicycling, sailing, table tennis, canoeing and scuba diving. Carpanedo's Fundación También teammate Irene Villa attended the final award ceremonies in support of her teammate and winter Paralympic sport in Spain.
