Vodafone McLaren Mercedes driver Heikki Kovalainen won the FIA Formula One 2008 ING Magyar Nagydíj at the Hungaroring, Budapest, Hungary on Sunday. It was the first Grand Prix win of Kovalainen's driving career and he became the 100th winner in Formula One history.

Ferrari driver Felipe Massa had dominated the race since the start when he overtook both McLaren front line sitters - first Kovalainen and then Lewis Hamilton. During the first part of the race, Hamilton punctured his front tyre and lost more positions as well as his hopes of winning. It seemed that Ferrari had the race in the pocket, but on the dying laps, Massa's engine was consumed by fire and he stopped on the main straight. Kovalainen took the opportunity to rush to the finish line.

Timo Glock did a brilliant job for his Toyota team, taking the second place. He qualified in fifth place and was in third until Massa went out.

The race became the first podium finish for Timo Glock, too. Still, his position was in danger from Kimi Räikkönen, who was racing close to Timo, but slowed down to secure his third place.

Renault drivers Fernando Alonso and Nelsinho Piquet finished fourth and sixth, respectively. They improved from their starting positions of seventh and tenth respectively. The Renault duo was split only by Lewis Hamilton.

The second Toyota of Jarno Trulli came in seventh. The top eight was rounded out by pole Robert Kubica from BMW Sauber.

Two other Renault-engined cars of Mark Webber and David Coulthard (Red Bull team) — split by Nick Heidfeld (BMW Sauber) — were the last cars to finish on the lead lap. TheHonda and Williams teams, as well as Giancarlo Fisichella from Force India were all lapped.

Ferrari now leads Constructors' Championship standings with 111 points, 11 ahead of McLaren and 90 ahead of BMW. The Drivers' standings are still lead by Hamilton with 62 points, but he is only 5 points ahead of Räikkönen and 8 ahead of Massa.
