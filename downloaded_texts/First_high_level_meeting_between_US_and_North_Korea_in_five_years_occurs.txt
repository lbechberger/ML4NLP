Christopher R. Hill, assistant U.S. secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, travelled to Pyongyang in North Korea today in the first high level meeting between the two countries in five years. The last meeting occurred in 2002, with James Kelly as the U.S. representative. 

This trip comes on the heels of news that North Korea would allow International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors to come to their country to discuss its nuclear program.

Hill and his entourage were greeted by North Korean director of U.S. affairs Ji Kun upon their arrival in Pyongyang. Hill is scheduled to fly back to Seoul tomorrow to report on the content of the meeting to diplomats in South Korea.
