The government of Kerala, a state in southern India, has banned the production and sale of both Coca-Cola and Pepsi after the Centre for Science and Environment, a NGO, found high levels of pesticide residue in the popular soft drinks. 

Kerala is the first state to impose a complete ban on the production and sale of the drinks, but five other states have said they will introduce partial bans in hospitals, schools and colleges. 

Chief minister V. S. Achuthanandan, CPI(M), said the two companies had been asked to wind up their operations, meaning the closure of a Pepsi and a Coca-Cola plant in the state.

The Indian Soft Drinks Manufacturers Association issued a statement saying: "Our products manufactured in India are absolutely safe and meet every safety standard set by food health and regulatory bodies in India and all over the world."
