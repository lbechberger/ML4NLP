Andrew Flintoff, back in the England side after passing a medical test on his ankle, took 3-45. Mahendra Singh Dhoni scored fifty for India, but they were bowled out for just 187 runs.

England's opening batsmen Luke Wright and Matt Prior were both dismissed for ducks by R P Singh in the second over. Despite the early setback England had few problems in reaching the target.
