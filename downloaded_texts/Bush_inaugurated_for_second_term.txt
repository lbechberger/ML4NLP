The United States inaugurated George W. Bush for a second term as president today. In his speech to the American people, Bush highlighted the need to bring freedom to world, using the word "freedom" some 19 times and "tyranny" 5 times. 

"America will not pretend that jailed dissidents prefer their chains, or that women welcome humiliation and servitude, or that any human being aspires to live at the mercy of bullies," said Bush.

Security has been very tight in the nation's capital, despite the lack of any specific threats. The costs of security have fallen to the District of Columbia, a departure from past inaugurations. The money will come out of the District's Homeland Security Fund.

A three-day celebration costing around US$40-50 million has been organized for the President. It is set to be the most expensive inauguration celebration in U.S. history.

The inaugration week is the only time that companies can wine and dine politicians. For instance, the Secretary of Transportation, Norm Mineta, was entertained by General Motors, a company over which he has considerable regulatory power.
