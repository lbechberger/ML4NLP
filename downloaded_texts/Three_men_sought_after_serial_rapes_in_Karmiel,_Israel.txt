Three unidentified men have been accused of kidnapping a young Israeli woman in Karmiel last Monday, and driving her to Safed where they allegedly raped her repeatedly, over several hours.

They then drove her back to where they took her from and she found her way to Nahariya hospital, where she has been hospitalized for several days and required several operations for her injuries.

The police suspect that the men are a gang of serial rapists who committed several other rapes in Karmiel recently.

The victim stated that the men were Arab and drove a white BMW.
