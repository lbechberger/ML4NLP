Russia has today expelled four UK diplomats in the ever escalating row over the extradition of Andrei Lugovoi, the chief suspect in the murder of former KGB agent Alexander Litvinenko who was poisoned with Polonium 210 in London, November 2006.

This move comes three days after the UK expelled four Russian diplomats. Russia says that the UK officials must leave within ten days and that they will review all visa applications for UK officials.

UK Foreign Secretary David Miliband said he was "disappointed" by the "completely unjustified move". However, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that he thought both countries could settle the "mini-crisis".
