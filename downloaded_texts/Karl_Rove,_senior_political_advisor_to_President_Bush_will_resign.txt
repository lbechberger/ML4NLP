According to officials, President Bush's senior political advisor, Karl Rove, will resign his White House post effective by the end of the month, senior administration officials said Monday. Rove has held a top position in the White House since Bush took office in January 2001.

President Bush and Rove are expected to make a statement to the press at 11:35 a.m. ET (UTC-4), as Bush boards Marine One, heading for Crawford, Texas.

In an interview with The Wall Street Journal, Rove said: "I just think it's time ... There's always something that can keep you here, and as much as I'd like to be here, I've got to do this for the sake of my family."
