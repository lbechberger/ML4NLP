On March 12th 2011 the Fukushima Daiichi Power Plant disaster caused a major effect on the environment by killing wildlife, rain forests and leaking radiation into the ocean. It caused an evacuation of over 160 000 people and a exclusion zone with a 20 kilometre radius within Fukushima. 

Recently polish journalist Arkaduisz Podniesinski took photographs of the abandoned area of Fukushima after he was given a grant to be allowed to set foot inside the contamination area. The same journalist had taken famous photographs of the city of Pripyat where the nuclear reactor was located when the Chernoybl disaster of 1986 took place.
 
Podniesinski took one very interesting picture of a highway where cars were completely abandoned. It is now been over grown by forestry. These photographs represent not only abandonment but a sadness. People used to drive these cars, they used to embrace this area. People used to live in this area and had friends who loved where they live. There is the possibility that these people will unfortunately never return to their homes.

When Chernobyl happened the civilians of Pripyat were told they would be back home in three days almost over 30 years later they have not been back. The Japanese government have developed plans for civilians to go back to Fukushima when in fact rivers, mountains, forests and crops are all recorded for high levels of radioactivity. Masami Yoshizawa is a cattle farmer and has returned to his farm frequently where his cows are stationed. He has detected that each cow has white spots all over them as they have consumed large amounts contaminated grass. Disasters like this will always seem to have a major impact on not just the environment but it will affect the economics, culture and agriculture of Japan.
