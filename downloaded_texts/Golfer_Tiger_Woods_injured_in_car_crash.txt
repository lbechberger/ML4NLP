American golfer Tiger Woods has been injured in a car crash near his home in Orlando, Florida. Woods was reported to have been leaving his home around 2:30 a.m. (EST) in his 2009 Cadillac Escalade, when he collided with a fire hydrant and a tree down the street.

Woods was taken to Health Central Hospital, and treated for facial lacerations. Early reports described his injuries as "serious", but he was released from a local hospital a short time later, and his publicist, Mark Steinberg, has since described the accident as "minor". There are also reports that the car's airbags did not deploy, which suggest a low speed collision. Windemere Mayor Gary Bruhn told CNN, "I think it's nothing more than an accident."

Police say alcohol did not play a role in the accident. An investigation is ongoing and reports say that charges could be filed against Woods.
