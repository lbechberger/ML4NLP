Hawaiian Democrat Neil Abercrombie announced Friday that he is resigning his position as Representative of the state's first congressional district, which he had held since 1991. He announced his candidacy for the position of Hawaii's governor on March 9, 2009. At this time the Democratic party has not named a preferred successor.

A news conference is scheduled for tomorrow, in which he will announce a formal date for resignation. In a statement on his website, he says that he is intending to go "all in" on his run for governor.

A statement from Jonah Ka'auwai, chairman of the Hawaiian Republican party, said that Abercrombie's resignation is a move to steal the election from opponent Charles Djou. Neither Abercrombie nor Djou have commented on the matter.
