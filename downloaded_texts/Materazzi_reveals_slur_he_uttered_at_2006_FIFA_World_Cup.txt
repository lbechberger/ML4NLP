Italy and Inter Milan defender Marco Materazzi revealed the slur he said to Zinedine Zidane at last year's FIFA World Cup in Germany, which led to Zidane's headbutting of Materazzi and subsequent red card for Zidane.

Materazzi said in an interview with the TV Sorrisi e Canzoni magazine that the insult was: "I prefer the whore that is your sister." The Interview is set to be released on Monday.

Materazzi had mentioned previously that the insult involved Zidane's sister, but had never given the exact words until now.
