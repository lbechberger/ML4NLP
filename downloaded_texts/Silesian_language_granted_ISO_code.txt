The Library of Congress has officially registered the Silesian language in its list of languages. Additionally, the International Linguistic Organization has registered the Silesian language and assigned it the ISO code "szl".

For several years the Alliance of Population of Silesian Nation and the Silesian Autonomy Movement have been seeking official recognition of the language. The Silesian language is now the second registered language in Silesia, the first being the Lower Silesian language which is currently under threat of extinction.
