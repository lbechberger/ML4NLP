Brawn GP driver Jenson Button won yesterday's FIA Formula One 2009 ING Turkish Grand Prix at the Istanbul Racing Circuit in Istanbul, Turkey. This became his sixth win in the season after seven races and became only the fifth driver to do so in history, after Alberto Ascari, Juan Manuel Fangio, Jim Clark and Michael Schumacher (twice). This is Buttons' forth race win in a row.

Pole-sitter Sebastian Vettel (Red Bull-Renault) made a crucial error on the first lap by running wide and lost the lead to Button. This spoiled the three pit-stop race strategy for Vettel who then lost second place to his teammate Mark Webber. Jarno Trulli finished fourth for Toyota.

Button's teammate, Rubens Barrichello, had a poor start and damaged his car after several unsuccessful overtaking attempts and later retired with a gearbox problem after 47 laps. This was Brawn GP's first retirement in the 2009 season. Giancarlo Fisicella was the only other retirement in the race when his Force India car had brake issues after four laps. 

Nico Rosberg finished fifth for WilliamsF1 with Felipe Massa (Ferrari) and Robert Kubica (BMW Sauber) finishing sixth and seventh respectively. Trulli's teammate Timo Glock closed out the top eight.

Jenson Button now has 61 points out of a possible 65 after seven races in the Drivers' Championship with Barrichello on 26 points and Vettel on 29. Brawn GP still dominates the Constructors' standings with 96, nearly 40 points ahead of Red Bull Racing.
