At least eight cars and a tanker have crashed on U.S. Route 27 near West Palm Beach, Florida. At least five people have been injured and no fatalities were been reported.

A gasoline tanker was in an accident with a flat-bed semi when several vehicles collided with the tanker. At least one semi has burst into flames.

Fire Rescue Capt. Don DeLucia said that "Severe fog might have caused the accident and hampered crews from getting there."

Both lanes of traffic were shutdown for several hours.
