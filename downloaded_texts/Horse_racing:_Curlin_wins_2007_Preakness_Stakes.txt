At the 132nd running of the Preakness, the second jewel in horse racing's Triple Crown, Robby Albarado rode Curlin to a photo finish victory over Kentucky Derby winner Street Sense. Going into the final stretch run, Curlin made a valiant charge to beat Street Sense by a head with a winning time of 1:53.46, matching the fastest ever finishing time in Preakness race history. Thus, for at least another year, the Triple Crown trophy will remain unclaimed. Affirmed was the last horse to accomplish what has become a rare feat for thoroughbred horses, back in 1978.

Curlin's win was as fast as track record holders (for 1 3/16 mile races) Tank's Prospect and Louis Quatorze, winners of the Preakness in 1985 and 1996, respectively. Curlin (4) paid $8.80 to win at odds of almost 7-2. The top three finishers in the Preakness were also the top three finishers in the Kentucky Derby, albeit in a different order. The $2 exacta of Curlin and Street Sense (4-8) paid $23.20. The $1 trifecta of Curlin, Street Sense, and Hard Spun (4-8-7) paid $25.00. Edgar Prado rode C P West to a 4th-place finish, capping off a $1 superfecta (4-8-7-9) of $340.30.

If a rematch happens between Street Sense and Curlin, it may not happen very soon. Carl Nafzger, trainer of Street Sense, has not indicated that he will run Street Sense in the Belmont Stakes on June 9.
