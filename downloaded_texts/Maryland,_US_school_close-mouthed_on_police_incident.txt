On February 14th, students at Pot Spring Elementary School in Timonium, Maryland noticed police activity in and around their school. School officials did not immediately offer an explanation for the presence of police cars and officers at the school.

The following day, Principal Karen Harris sent a brief letter to parents. The letter acknowledges that an incident involving the school required assistance from the Baltimore County police. The letter assured parents that the situation was not dangerous, but did not describe the incident. 

The Harris letter asked those with questions to contact the school by phone. Jane Martin, the assistant principal, declined to describe the event that had called for police assistance. She indicated school administrators became concerned that rumors of a bomb, gun, or other violence were spreading mainly among 4th and 5th grade students. This concern prompted the principalâ€™s letter. Martin said that the school was not evacuated on February 14th.

At the time of this article the Baltimore County Police Department has not responded to inquiries.
