The Scottish Football Association has apologised after fans booed the Liechtenstein national team during their national anthem at last night's Euro 2012 qualifier. A section of the Scottish fans started to jeer the anthem due to its similarity to God Save the Queen.

Acting chief executive George Peat said in a statement that "I was embarrassed and extremely disappointed by the disgraceful behaviour of some of our supporters during the Liechtenstein national anthem at Hampden Park last night". He added "I apologise unreservedly to our visitors for the crass reaction to their anthem."

Scotland defeated Liechtenstein 2-1 to win them three points. Mario Frick scored first for Liechtenstein just after the start of the second half, but Kenny Miller later scored off the bar to equalise the game. In the final minutes of extra time Stephen McManus scored with a header to put Scotland to the top of Group I.
