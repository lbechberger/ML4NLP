A small explosive device detonated this afternoon at a police guard post near to the residence of former Prime Minister General Prem Tinsulanonda in Bangkok. The device injured two tourists, one Canadian and one British.

Prem was Thailand's PM from 1980, dismissing parliament and resigning the position in 1988. He went on to join the country's Privy Council and now chairs it.

The explosion comes against the backdrop of political tension in the country, with all main opposition parties boycotting the April 2nd election called by Thaksin Shinawatra. Protests against the PM now occur daily, with a proposed boycott of goods and services from companies associated with the PM or his family being put into place.
