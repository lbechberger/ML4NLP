The Oklahoma State University men's golf team won its 10th NCAA title last Saturday under first year head coach Mike McGraw.

After tying for fourth in the Big 12 Conference championship, McGraw said "The disappointment we felt after the conference championship was so deep, but these guys came back and changed their season by realizing you can't take winning for granted."

Jonathan Moore, a redshirt freshman, became the eighth individual national championship for Oklahoma State, the first since Charles Howell III in 2000. Okalhoma State also swept both team and individual championships in 1978, 1987, and 2000.

The Golf Coaches Association of America based in Norman, Oklahoma named Mike McGraw coach of the year earlier this week for guilding Oklahoma State to five tournament wins this season.

Florida took second place while both Minnesota and Wake Forest tied for third at the NCAA championships.
