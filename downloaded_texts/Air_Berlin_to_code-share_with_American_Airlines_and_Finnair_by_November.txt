Low-cost German airline Air Berlin, which recently announced that it will join the Oneworld airline alliance, has stated that it plans to begin code-sharing with fellow Oneworld members American Airlines and Finnair as early as November. The airline also said that it could begin code-sharing with British Airways and Iberia in summer 2011. 

"We're in concrete talks with American Airlines over code share flights that we'd like to start in November. The same applies for Finnair Oyj," Air Berlin chief executive Joachim Hunold said.

A code-share agreement with American Airlines would have a predicted "'incremental market potential' of 2.4 million passengers a year," according to Dow Jones. The "incremental market potential" would be an extra 1.7 million fliers a year with a code-sharing agreement.

Air Berlin accepted an invitation to join the Oneworld alliance late July. The air carrier became the first low-cost airline to join one of the three major airline alliances: Star Alliance, Oneworld, and SkyTeam. Air Berlin joined the alliance sponsored by British Airways.
