The Georgetown branch of the District of Columbia library is currently on fire in the United States capital of Washington, DC.

In addition to books, the Georgetown Public Library has a large collection of historic documents and paintings that are part of the Peabody Collection. Firefighters are attempting to salvage some of these items.

DC Fire and Emergency Services (EMS) dispatched units at approximately 12:30 p.m. on April 30, 2007 to a report of smoke in the building. The first arriving fire fighters reported heavy smoke and began an initial attack. Fire fighters were soon pulled out of the building because of fears that the building might collapse.

The fire has been upgraded to a 3rd alarm fire with numerous fire apparatus responding. The fire has been largely knocked down as of 1:45 p.m., though many units remain on the scene. 

Traffic on Wisconsin Avenue and other area streets is being detoured around the fire area.
