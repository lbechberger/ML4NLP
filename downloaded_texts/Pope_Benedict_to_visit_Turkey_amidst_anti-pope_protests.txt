Pope Benedict will be visiting Turkey, a predominantly Muslim nation, for four days starting on November 28.

Some, organized by an Islamist party, protested the visit in the streets after hearing of the Pope's trip. Security concerns are on the rise as the protests progress.

Benedict will arrive in Ankara, the capital of Turkey. According to Turkish Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul, objectives of the Pope's visit are to eliminate misunderstandings between Muslims and Christians, and to clean up the 1,000-year divide in Christianity between the Vatican and Orthodox churches. Benedict also plans to meet with political and religious leaders in Ankara.

Police are taking full measures to ensure the Pope is safe during his trip.
