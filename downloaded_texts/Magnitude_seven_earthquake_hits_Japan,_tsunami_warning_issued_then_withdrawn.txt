A tsunami warning has been issued for some parts of Japan's eastern coast after an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.0 struck off the shore, near the city of Iwaki. It is believed, however, that the Tsunami warning was withdrawn as the Japan Meteorological Agency currently lists no Tsunami warnings, with two tsunami warnings from earlier today being listed in the past warnings section of the Agency's website.

The initial reports from the scene of the earthquake shown no injuries, although buildings were observed being shook by the quake 300 kilometers away in Tokyo.

The withdrawn tsunami warning said there was a possibility of a small Tsunami in Fukushima and Miyagi. Fukushima is 145 km away from the epicenter of the earthquake.
