On Sunday, at a Bapist church originally founded by freed slaves, US President Barack Obama addressed the congregation about the "Dream" of slain civil rights activist Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.—whom Obama credits with paving the way for his 2008 election—and about the importance of hope and faith in his own life.

On Monday, Obama, with his family in tow, served hot lunches at a local Washington soup kitchen—one of several ways America's first black president planned to pay tribute to the late Dr. King on the federal holiday that honors his legacy and lasting impact upon society. 

Later at the White House, Obama will host a gathering consisting of small selected group of African-American seniors and their grandchildren where they will discuss the meaning of the civil rights movement and how it still effects them to this day. Following which, that evening, the Obamas are slated to attend the "Let Freedom Ring" concert at the Kennedy Center. A musical event that will feature gospel artists and choir members from various area churches among other houses of worship.

Another prominent American politician, governor-elect of New Jersey, Chris Christie held a banquet on Monday evening to honor the importance of Dr. King's message as well. Other commemorations included a march in Seattle where participants rallied for issues in the African-American community.
