Yesterday, Atlético Madrid's Diego Costa scored his team's only goal in their 1–0 victory in La Liga play over cross town rivals Real Madrid at Estadio Santiago Bernabéu in Madrid.

The goal came in the tenth minute after a pass from Koke. The goal was Costa's eighth in this season of La Liga, and ended Real Madrid's 30-plus–game home winning streak. The home team crowd responded to Costa's play with chants of "Costa is not Spanish."
