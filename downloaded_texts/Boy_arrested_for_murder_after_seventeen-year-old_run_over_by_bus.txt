A fifteen-year-old boy has been arrested in Walthamstow, London, England after Ezekiel Amosu, 17, was run over by a bus Monday night. Metropolitan Police detectives said that Amosu may have been "involved in an altercation with a group of teenagers immediately beforehand".

Amosu was walking with four friends when they were approached by a group of youths, who asked for Amosu's mobile phone. It is unclear as to whether Amousu was attempting to escape, or was pushed under the bus during the fight. The officer in charge of the investigation, Detective Chief Inspector John Sandlin, stated that "[w]hat happened exactly is unclear at this stage but we believe that he may have been the victim of an attempted robbery minutes beforehand".

The number 123 bus was traveling west towards Blackhorse Road station when the impact happened, at the intersection of Forest Road and Pembar Avenue, resulting in Amosu receiving fatal crush injuries. Amosu was declared dead at the scene, which was attended by homicide detectives after reports of a fight in the street before the incident.
