The Hawaii-based Pacific Tsunami Warning Center has released notices in response to each of the four quakes, stating that no destructive force has been generated by the deep quakes.

The quake was reported felt in cities such as Zamboanga, and officials "were still determining if there were casualties or damages", Xinhua reported. A resident in the area, Yolly Andrias told Xinhua that "they were still sleeping when the strong quake awoke them."

An 8.0 earthquake struck the region in 1976, generating a tsunami which devastated 700 kilometers of coastline in the Sulu Archipelago and southern Mindanao island. The region includes faults in the Sulu Trench in the Sulu Sea and the Cotabato Trench, a subduction zone crossing the Celebes Sea and the Moro Gulf.
