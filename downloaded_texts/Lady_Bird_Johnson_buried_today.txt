The funeral procession, which departed from state capitol in Austin, Texas, slowly moved up Austin and Hill County roads which were lined with hundreds of admirers of Lady Bird Johnson holding flowers, waving American flags or holding up the "hook 'em Horns" sign in honor of her years as a student at the University of Texas and former UT System regent as the hearse carrying her body passed enroute to the LBJ ranch located in Stonewall, TX. 

Mrs. Johnson will be buried in the family cemetery next to her late husband and ex-president Lyndon Baines Johnson who died in 1973. The funeral for Mrs. Johnson was held on Saturday at the Riverbend Centre, attended by over 1,800 people including family, friends along with former presidents Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton. There were five current or former first ladies present, Laura Bush, Rosalynn Carter, Nancy Reagan, Barbara Bush and Hillary Rodham Clinton.
