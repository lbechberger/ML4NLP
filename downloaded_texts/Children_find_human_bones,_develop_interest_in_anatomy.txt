Teachers at the elementary school of Reduzum in Friesland, the Netherlands were surprised at what their pupils turned up with yesterday. The children had found some human bones in a large pile of landfill, originating from the Oudehove cemetery in the Frisian capital city of Leeuwarden, which is being turned into an underground parking garage.

Officials have spoken with the contractor, Strukton, which was responsible for moving the soil to a site near the bridge across the Swin, near Reduzum. The bones will be moved with the rest of the cemetery to a new site north of Leeuwarden.

The school principal reported that the children were hardly shocked when they found what they had discovered, and that they were more interested to learn about human anatomy. A biology lesson ensued.
