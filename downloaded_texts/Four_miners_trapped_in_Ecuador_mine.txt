According to a Government Official, four miners are trapped in an Ecuador mine located 250 miles (405 kilometers) southeast of the country's capital, Quito. The miners have been trapped since 03:00 (08:00 UTC) local time.

According to the Under-Secretary of Mining Development, Jorge Espinoza, the men are trapped 500 feet (150 meters) below the surface. Rescuers are currently on the scene and they expect to reach the men within 24 hours.

According to a Government Official, the men are believed to be alive "because they were far enough away from the site of the collapse," however their condition is unknown and rescuers have not been able to make contact with them. It is estimated that there is five to six days of breathable air left in the mine. 

The mine is suspected to have collapsed due to a build up of underground water which caused the mine's supports to buckle and collapse, blocking all exits.
