A hearse driver in County Donegal, Ireland was pulled over while leading a funeral procession, in a police crackdown on speeding. John Carr was clocked driving at 69 km/h (43 miles/hour) in a 50km/h zone and fined 80 euro and 2 penalty points were added to his driving record.

Carr, as well as other drivers in the cortege, were among hundreds of drivers caught speeding in the area. Irish police have said if the fines are not paid the drivers will face prosecution. Carr intends to pay the fine. He said, "I've never heard of a hearse being done for speeding before. I supposed I'll probably have to pay the fine. I'm not too worried about the points because I intend not to incur any more."
