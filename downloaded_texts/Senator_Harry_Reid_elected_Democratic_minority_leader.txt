Democratic Senator Harry Reid has been elected the new leader of the Democratic party in the Senate. Reid, from Nevada, replaces out-going leader Tom Daschle who lost his re-election bid in the state of South Dakota. Reid was re-elected with 61% of the vote in the November elections.

Reid won the position as the Republican party still holds majority in both houses of Congress. Dennis Hastert (R-IL) and Tom DeLay (R-TX) were re-elected by the Republicans for new terms as Speaker and Majority Leader in the House of Representatives.

Senator Dick Durbin (D-IL) replaced Reid as the Senate Minority Whip.
