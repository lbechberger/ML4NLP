Watch manager Su Daintith released a statement confirming the death of the individual. "The man we believe was about to enter the water at the bottom of the sea wall steps when he was swept off without any warning by a large wave which was a result of the overnight weather conditions," they said. "Our thoughts are with his family and friends during this tragic time."
