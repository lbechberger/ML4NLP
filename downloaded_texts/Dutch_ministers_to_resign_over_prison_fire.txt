Dutch Justice Minister Jan Piet Hein Donner (from the political party CDA) and Minister of Housing, Spatial Planning and the Environment Sybilla Dekker (from the VVD) will resign, the state broadcaster reports, after a report partly blamed them for a fire at a jail in Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport on October 27, 2005, in which 11 illegal immigrants died. The report says that, if the government had adhered to fire regulations, "less or no" people would have died.
