Two pilots were killed Saturday, September 1st, 2007, in an accident at the Radom Air Show in Poland. 

The accident occurred on the first day of the two-day show, which had begun that morning.

Four Zlin Z-50s from the Zelazny air team were performing aerobatic maneuvers in front of a crowd consisting of thousands of spectators when two of them collided head on in mid-air. Both planes were traveling at 300km/h when they collided, and disintegrated on impact.

The pilots, both of whom came from Zielona GÃ³ra in western Poland, were killed in the accident. One pilot, Lech Marchlewski, 62, had been intending to retire immediately after the flight, which was supposed to be his last air show performance. The other pilot was 24.

An investigation has been launched into the cause of the crash. All further activities at this year's Radam Air Show are canceled, and the Radom city mayor declared three days of mourning as a result of the crash.
