England boss Steve McClaren has announced his 23-man squad for the Euro 2008 qualifiers against Israel and Andorra.

The biggest surprise pick for the squad was Newcastle United's Scott Parker. Bayern Munich midfielder Owen Hargreaves will make his England return after a broken leg kept him out of competition. Other central midfielders in the squad will include Steven Gerrard, Frank Lampard and Michael Carrick. 

On the wings, Aaron Lennon may start down the right, while Kieron Dyer or Stewart Downing may play on the left.

Likely strikers for the club are Manchester United's Wayne Rooney and Andy Johnson of Everton.

Manchester United's on-loan keeper Ben Foster started the game against Spain last time out for England, but he is sure to be backup to Paul Robinson in the qualifiers.

John Terry and Rio Ferdinand may well make up the center of the defense with Gary Neville and Ashley Cole possibly supporting from the defensive wings. 

Notable exceptions from the squad include Manchester City's Joey Barton and Gareth Barrey of Aston Villa.
