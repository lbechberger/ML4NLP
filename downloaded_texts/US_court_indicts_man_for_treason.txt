Adam Gadahn, formerly Adam Pearlman, is the first US citizen to be charged with treason since WWII. The State Department has offered a reward of $1 million for his capture.

Gadahn, 28, has allegedly appeared in multiple videos supporting al-Qaida. He is not in US custody and is assumed to be living in Pakistan.

Treason is the only crime specifically defined in the United States Constitution. The penalities, if convicted, range from death to 5 years in prison and a $10,000 fine.
