The H5N1 Avian Flu virus has been found in a dead wild Canadian Goose in Abbotsbury Swannery in Dorset, England. This is the eleventh case of the virus turning up in wild birds. The goose was discovered on February 25, 2008.

"The finding of more cases in wild birds is not unexpected ... We are currently considering whether any additional restrictions are necessary in the area," said the United Kingdom's Health Ministry in a statement to the media.

As a result of the finding, poultry movement has now been restricted by the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) in the areas surrounding the Swannery. The removal of all birds, dead or alive from any property now requires a license. DEFRA says the restrictions will expire no earlier than 31 days.

Ten other cases of the virus have appeared in dead birds, all Mute Swans from the same area.
