Today, it was announced that Syd Barrett, the founding member of British rock band Pink Floyd died from a complication with diabetes. According to a Pink Floyd spokeswoman, he died days earlier (July 7) but the announcement was withheld. "He died peacefully at home. There will be a private family funeral in the next few days," said his brother Alan Barrett. "The band are naturally very upset and sad to learn of Syd Barrettâ€™s death. Syd was the guiding light of the early band line-up and leaves a legacy which continues to inspire," noted a statement issued by Pink Floyd.

During 1967-1968, Syd Barrett was considered to be the main member and songwriter of Pink Floyd. However, due to mental illness, he was forced to leave the band after recording only one album, The Piper at the Gates of Dawn. Barrett had since been a recluse. Pink Floyd recorded Wish You Were Here as a tribute following Barrett's leave. The album features Shine On You Crazy Diamond, with lyrics explicitly about Barrett's rise to fame and subsequent dissolution.
