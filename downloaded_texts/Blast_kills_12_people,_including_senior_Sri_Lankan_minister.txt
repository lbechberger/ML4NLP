The Sri Lankan highways minister, Jeyaraj Fernandopulle, was today killed, by a bombing, while attending an event to mark the upcoming Tamil New Year. Over 14 others were also killed in the blast.

At least 90 others were injured.

The Media Minister for Sri Lanka commented on the bombings. "It was a suicide bombing of the Tigers," he said. 'Tigers' was referring to the militant organization, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, and is recognised by over 30 countries as a terrorist organization. The Tigers are advocates of a separate state in Sri Lanka for the Tamil minority.
