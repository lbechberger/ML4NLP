Ferrari driver Kimi Räikkönen won the FIA Formula-1 2007 ING Belgian Grand Prix on the Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps at Spa, Belgium. He and his teammate, Felipe Massa, showed the fastest times during most of the pre-race sessions, taking the front line as a result.

Both McLaren Mercedes drivers Fernando Alonso and Lewis Hamilton were unable to compete with the red cars, tring their utmost to use a slightest mistake of their rivals, if any. Still, Kimi and Felipe were in full control of the race after making a significant gap to Alonso, number one of McLaren.

Start of the race resulted in a slight side touch between McLaren cars, with Hamilton forced to make an evasive manoeuvre out of the track, a reminiscent of the Hungary practice session incident between them.

Two German drivers Nick Heidfeld from BMW Saubers and Nico Rosberg from Williams-Toyota saw the chequered flag 5th and 6th. Mark Webber owned 7th place for Red Bull-Renault team.

Heikki Kovalainen's Renault closed the top eight after his highlighted struggle with Robert Kubica on the third part of the race.

Another highlight became Adrian Sutil's driving for Spyker-Ferrari, who was pushing hard on David Coulthard on the first part of the race. The young German driver finished 14th far ahead of both Super Aguri's and his teammate.

Alonso came closer to Hamilton in Drivers' Championship, and have now a gap of just 2 points between the teammates. The situation in Constructors' Championship after the World Motorsport Council ruling over McLaren on September 13 became clear for Ferrari with their 161 points, 71 points ahead of BMW Sauber.
