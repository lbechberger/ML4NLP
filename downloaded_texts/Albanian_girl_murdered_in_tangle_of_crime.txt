An Albanian girl who publicly exposed alleged corruption in the Vlorë police department has died violently. Eighteen-year-old Joana Besnik Dudushi, using the pseudonym "Stela," revealed on the live show "Fiks Fare" in April that officers forced her to work as a prostitute. Dudushi would later accuse her patrons of rape and police would collect hefty bribes to let them off. She had previously been arrested for prostitution on February 25, 2005. Dudushi was found stabbed to death in the Albanian port city Vlorë.

Dudushi had not been placed in witness protection as she was pressured to withdraw her accusations. An internal investigation of the Vlorë police found no evidence of wrong-doing on the part of officers in the case of the alleged forced prostitution.

The murder probably took place on Sunday, July 31 according to the local police, which also states that at least ten suspects have been questioned. The body of Joana Dudushi was found near her apartment where she lived with her several-month-old baby.
