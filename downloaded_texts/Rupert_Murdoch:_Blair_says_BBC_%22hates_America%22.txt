Media magnate Rupert Murdoch, managing director and the largest shareholder of News Corporation, claimed that the UK Prime Minister Tony Blair offered his opinions about the BBC in a private conversation with him. According to Murdoch, Blair views BBC World Service broadcasts as portraying America in a negative light, and accusing their coverage of Hurricane Katrina to be used for political statements.

Murdoch, a long-time critic of the BBC, apparently revealed details of his conversation with the Prime Minister during a session of the Clinton Global Initiative in New York. Murdoch's News Corp. owns Fox News and Sky News, both BBC competitors.
