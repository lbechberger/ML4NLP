J.J. Redick was arrested and charged with drunk driving early Tuesday in Durham County, North Carolina and lost his driving privileges in North Carolina for 30 days. Redick was released on a $1,000 bond shortly after being arrested.

According to the arresting officer Redick had "very glassy eyes, strong odor of alcohol coming from breath" and a blood-alcohol level of 0.11. The legal limit in North Carolina is 0.08.

In a statement released by Duke University, Redick apologized saying, "I regret what happened last night, and want to apologize to my family and the Duke community for the incident."

Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski said, "J.J. knows he made a mistake and regrets it. He represented the very best in college athletics and exhibited outstanding character at Duke the last four years. He is and will continue to be a credit to the Duke basketball family. As his friend and his coach, he has my total support."

J.J. Redick is expected to be taken in the first round of the NBA draft that takes place on June 28. How the incident hurts Redick in the draft is unclear.
