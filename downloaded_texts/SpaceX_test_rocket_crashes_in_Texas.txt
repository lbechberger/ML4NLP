SpaceX's F9R test vehicle self-destructed yesterday during a test flight at their McGregor, Texas test facility. There were no injuries. According to a witness, "there is a big grass fire from falling debris."

According to a statement issued by SpaceX, "Throughout the test and subsequent flight termination, the vehicle remained in the designated flight area. There were no injuries or near injuries. An FAA representative was present at all times."

John Taylor, a SpaceX spokesman, said that "[d]uring the flight, an anomaly was detected in the vehicle and the flight termination system automatically terminated the mission." SpaceX has said that more information will be forthcoming once they've analyzed the flight data.
