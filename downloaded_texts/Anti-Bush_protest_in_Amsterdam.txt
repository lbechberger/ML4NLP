Protesters gathered in Amsterdam, Maastricht, and several other cities in The Netherlands to protest a visit by the United States President, George W. Bush. As many as 2,000 people gathered in Amsterdam's Museum Square, voicing their discontent with the war in Iraq.

Many protesters consider Bush personally responsible for the torture in Abu Ghraib prison and human rights violations in Guantanamo Bay. Their arguments are based on documentary evidence such as the FBI email showing that Bush directly ordered what might be described as torture (hoods, sleep deprivation) . A large number of protesters carried signs that read "George W. Bush: Warcriminal." More than 150 people attended a demonstration in Maastricht, many going to Beek Airport to give Bush an unpleasant and noisy welcome.
