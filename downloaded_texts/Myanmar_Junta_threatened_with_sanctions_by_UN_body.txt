The UN International Labour Organisation (ILO) has warned the generals that make up the military government of Myanmar, more commonly known as Burma, that they may face sanctions should they not improve their record over forced labour.

The call to change policy and attitudes towards forced labour that the ILO issued following a meeting of their governing body in Geneva late last week was countered by promises from the regime that they would not withdraw from the organisation.

The warning issued by the ILO has been followed by calls from the EU for the Security Council and Secretary General of the UN to get involved in efforts to reform the country. The EU Parliament passed its resolution on Burma by a significant majority, only three members opposed and two abstained.
