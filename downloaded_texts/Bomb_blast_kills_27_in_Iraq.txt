Yesterday, as the United States withdrew their troops from towns and cities across Iraq, a car bomb exploded in Kirkuk, reportedly killing 27 people and injuring more than 40.

The vehicle was parked near the Shurja market, one of the most famous markets in Iraq, approximately 155 miles from Baghdad. 

Iraqi and American troops are on high alert for attempts to destabilise the country during the staged withdrawal. Last week, a truck bomb killed more than 70 people, with a similar aim of returning Iraq to the secetarian violence that plagued the country three years ago.

Iraq's armed forces have now taken over security in urban areas as part of Barack Obama's much publisised phased withdrawal of troops from Iraq. On hearing the news, Obama was quoted as saying; "The future belongs to those who build, not to those who destroy."
