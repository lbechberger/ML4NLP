After being postponed a week because of weather, on Saturday and Sunday, April 30 and May 1, Faneuil Hall Marketplace in Boston, Massachusetts, held public auditions for their 2005 performance slots. Thirty-two performance and musical acts got the coveted slots at one of the city's popular tourist destinations. Benefits of performing in the Faneuil Hall/Quincy Market area include exposure and tips from passersby.

Although the auditions were open to the public, few people seemed to find the location for the tryouts, since they were held on the second floor of Quincy Market because of the weather. Were it not raining, they would have been held outside.

Acts vying for performance slots included Dan Foley, who has juggled chairs at the marketplace for several seasons, jugglers, and a contortionist. Musicians included The Vegas Valentinos, a loud rock and roll act reminiscient of Elvis; Apple Crisp, a father and son with a keyboard and a vibraphone; a few guitar/harmonica combinations; and Tom Bianchi, a familiar site among Boston street performers.

The emcee between musical acts tried to steal the show with bad jokes. Luckily, audience members steeled themselves and braved his jokes to listen to Toby Tobas' steel drums.

The judges selected performers earlier this week. Entertainment will begin on Memorial Day weekend.
