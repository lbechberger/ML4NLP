The final one-day cricket match between Australia and New Zealand has ended with no result after the game was called off due to rain.

The lack of a result means that the inaugural Chappell-Hadlee Trophy will not be awarded, as the series was tied at one game each. In the first game, New Zealand scored a thrilling victory from behind to win with two balls to spare, while in the second game, Australia knocked New Zealand over with 17 balls to spare after a valiant fightback attempt by Kyle Mills. 

Australia will next meet New Zealand in international cricket in February of 2006, when the Australian team will tour New Zealand and play three one-day internationals. 

New Zealand spin bowler Daniel Vettori was proclaimed to be the man of the series, and took away a 42-inch plasma television as a prize.
