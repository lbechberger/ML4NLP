Taiwanese President Chen Shui-bian's son and daughter-in-law, Chen Chih-chung and Huang Jui-ching, returned to Taiwan Friday at 11:00pm Taipei time from New York.

Huang Jui-ching is pregnant, and politicians in Taiwan of all stripes have called on her to come home to give birth. President Chen had promised in September that his daughter-in-law would give birth in Taiwan and that his grandson would not be an American.

Politicians and media have speculated that the couple would give birth in the US. Chen Chih-chung stated that he and his wife had no intention of giving birth in the States.
