Police in South-Western Sydney raided two homes in Greenfield Park on Monday, seizing 1 million AUD worth of cannabis. Both houses were located on Smithfield Road.

The two houses were raided at 11:30 AM AEST on Monday where police found what they called "ellaborate [sic] hydroponic set-ups". Police seized 360 cannabis plants in addition to a large quantity of processed cannabis.

At the time of the raids, there was nobody at home. No charges have been laid over the discovery, but police say they are continuing investigations.

According to police, the Wetherill Park Target Action Group are cracking down on the cultivation of hydroponic cannabis.
