Thousands of spectators lined Queen St. in central Auckland, New Zealand to watch a parade of around 20 female porn stars riding topless on motorcycles. The girls, wearing studded knee-high leather boots and leather pants, braved a winter chill, nippy wind and objections by some city officials, in a shot at promoting an Auckland Erotica Expo happening later this week.

Auckland Mayor Dick Hubbard described the parade as "morally repugnant."
