Ukrainian heavyweight boxer Wladimir Klitschko began his quest to unify the heavyweight boxing titles Saturday night. The IBF Heavyweight Champion defeated Russian WBO Heavyweight Champion, Sultan Ibragimov, by unanimous decision in the main event of a boxing card at Madison Square Garden in New York City.

Many of the spectators were disappointed by the conservative boxing mechanics used by both Klitschko and the Russian Ibragimov. But the decision was clearly in the Ukrainian's favor, as the scorecards read 119-110, 118-110 and 117-111 in his favor.

It was Ibragimov's first defeat, bringing his record to 22-1-1 with 17 KO's. Klitschko is now 50-3 with 44 KO's.

While Klitschko looks forward to vying for the WBA and WBC titles, held by Uzbekistani Ruslan Chagaev and Russian Oleg Maskaev, respectively, his next fight will be against Aleksandr Povetkin in an IBF-mandated title defense. Chagaev's next fight is against Luan Krasinqi. Maskaev next fights Samuel Peter, with the winner facing Wladimir's brother, Vitali Klitschko.
