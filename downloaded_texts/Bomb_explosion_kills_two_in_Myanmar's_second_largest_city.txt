Hospital officials reported Tuesday that two women were killed by a bomb blast at a market in Mandalay, the second largest city in Myanmar. The city is located about 430 miles north of the capital Yangon.

Police officials confirmed a bomb explosion at the Zay Cho market, yet the military-government of Myanmar did not provide any details about the incident. A doctor said one of the women died at the market and the other died in the hospital.

16 other people were wounded and taken to the hospital. Reports indicate there was a single explosion at the ground of the busy market at 16:15 local time. In the past several small bomb explosions have been reported without any victims.
