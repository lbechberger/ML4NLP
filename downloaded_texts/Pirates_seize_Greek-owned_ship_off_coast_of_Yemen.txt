A Kenyan maritime official said today that pirates hijacked a Greek-owned bulk carrier in the Gulf of Aden, near Yemen.

Andrew Mwangura of the East African Seafarers Assistance Program said the ship, named the Red Sea Spirit was taken on Thursday, but news of the seizure only emerged earlier today. According to him, the vessel was seized about 36 nautical miles from Balhaf, a Yemeni port.

"Red Sea Spirit was taken by gunmen off the Yemeni coast last Thursday. She is flying the Panama flag. She is a Greek-owned bulk carrier," Mwangura said.

Somali pirates are currently holding at least thirteen ships and more than 200 crew. They are still active in the waters off the east coast of Africa, despite the presence of many navies patrolling the region.
