Official results of the local elections held in Croatia yesterday are still pending, but according to exit polls and preliminary results the currently ruling party, Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) has performed poorly. 

HDZ has a lead in nine of 21 counties, and the second largest party, Social Democrat Party of Croatia (SDP) has a clear lead in three out of four big cities, including Zagreb. Four years ago, HDZ won 15 counties. Ivo Sanader, the current Prime Minister of Croatia and the leader of HDZ, said at 23:00 local time yesterday: "HDZ is the winner of local elections. Our politics on state level was approved."

Milan BandiÄ‡, in front of the list of SDP, Croatian Peasant Party (HSS) and Croatian Party of Pensioners (HSU) will be able to form a government in the Zagreb assembly on his own. Most of the other places will probably see formation of coalitions, since hardly anybody is receiving majority support.
