Police searching for the remains of missing Bathurst woman Janine Vaughan have discovered bones which they claim may belong to the missing woman. Ms Vaughan disappeared after being seen getting into a red car with a male after being a Bathurst pub on December 7, 2001.

On Sunday, police began a fresh search for the missing woman's remains after they received new information. On Monday at approximately 3:00 p.m. AEST police discovered bones during a ground sweep of an area off Montavella Road, Gormans Hill adjacent to the Macquarie River. Forensic services police were bought in several hours later, but initial tests proved inconclusive.

Police were guarding the site overnight and forensic officers are expected to conduct further tests today.

Police also search bushland near a creek at Yetholme, 15 km East of Bathurst on Monday using two specialist cadaver dogs on loan from Queensland Police.

Police have revealed that the search has prompted several members of the local community to call the police's Crime Stoppers hotline with information. Chief Superintendent Mark Holahan said “It's a cross-section of information. Some of it will probably lead us to some new lines of inquiry, and some of it will help us to reaffirm some of those things we already know.”

The detective who led the initial investigation into Ms Vaughan's disappearance for several days continues to be a person of interest to police in the case. The detective, Brad Hosemans, is also a former deputy mayor of the city. Mr Hosemans, who has since left the police force, has denied any involvement.

Chief Supt. Holahan said the former detective was only one of a number of persons of interest in the case.

The Police Integrity Commission has investigated the initial handling of the case but is yet to hand down a finding.
