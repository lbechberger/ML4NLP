The Pentagon confirmed that a C-5 Galaxy military cargo plane crashed at Dover Air Force Base in Delaware, saying that the plane was having "mechanical problems" and crashed "while taking off." The plane was carrying 17 people.

ABC News reported no fatalities, but Allen Metheny, assistant director in the State Department, said that some were injured and taken to the hospital; the extent of the injuries was unknown. At least 10 people have been reported to have been taken to BayHealth hospital.

The plane crashed about 6:45 a.m. EDT (1045 UTC) and broke into three separate sections. 

The C-5 Galaxy is the largest plane in operation in the U.S. military.
