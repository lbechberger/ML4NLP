The proposed Elmwood Village Hotel got the final approval it needed from the city of Buffalo's Planning Board this morning.

In a unanimous vote, the Board approved most of the design and site plan of the hotel.

The Elmwood Village Hotel is a proposed hotel by Savarino Construction Services Corporation and is designed by architect Karl Frizlen of the Frizlen Group. It is to be placed on the corner of Elmwood and Forest Avenues in Buffalo and will require the demolition of at least five properties (1109-1121 Elmwood).

Despite the fact that today's meeting was not a "public hearing", several citizens lashed out at the Board after the approval.

"Thanks for destroying Buffalo," said one man.

"[I am] disgusted. Because they did not allow the community to speak, it is the bastardization of the concepts of justice and democracy, and that's what happened [today]," said Clarence Carnahan, a local business owner and concerned citizen, to Wikinews. He also referred to some board members as "immoral pigs."

"[I feel] frustration because no one could speak. I was going to address the displacement of all the shops that are there and that they should be grand-fathered into the new space. We did not get to say that. [I am disappointed] that they are endorsing this enormous monstrosity." said Nancy Pollina, co-owner of Don Apparel with Patty Morris at 1119 Elmwood.

Although the Board approved the hotel proposal, Savarino Construction must still go before the board to approve things such as signage and lighting. The Planning Board meets again on April 11, 2006 at 8:00a.m., but it is unknown if the hotel proposal will be on the agenda.
