The 15-year-old who killed Christopher Currie was Ngatai Rewiti of Otahuhu, Auckland. He has been found not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter at the High Court of Auckland today, July 6. He was unable to be named earlier due to name suppression but after the verdict was heard Justice Helen Winkelmann lifted name suppression.

Rewiti will be given his sentence September 6.

The jury took four hours to reach the verdict after the four-day trial.

He was facing murder charges after dropping an eight-kilogram concrete block onto a car travelling on the Auckland motorway, killing the driver.
