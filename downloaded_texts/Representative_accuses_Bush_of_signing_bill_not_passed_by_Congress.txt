On March 15, Congressman Henry Waxman (D-CA) sent a letter to President Bush's White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card, accusing Bush of signing a law that did not pass the House of Representatives.

The bill in question is called the Deficit Reduction Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 2005. Before a bill is passed into law the same version needs to be approved by both the House and the Senate.

Waxman cited a $2 billion spending difference over the next 5 years between the conflicting versions of the bill.

Waxman also stated his understanding that either the Speaker of the House or his staff called the White House to inform President Bush of the situation before signing the bill. Another letter was written March 22 by House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Congressman Waxman asking the White House to respond.
