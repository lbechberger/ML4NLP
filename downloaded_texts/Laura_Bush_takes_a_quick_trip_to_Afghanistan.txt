In a surprise announcement, United States First Lady Laura Bush flew to Afghanistan for a 5-hour stay today. Bush has desired to take this trip for a number of years, but it has been delayed for security reasons. Security is still a concern â€” the trip was only announced as she was about to depart from Andrews Air Force base near Washington, DC.

Bush told reporters, "I have been so looking forward to going to Afghanistan. When I really realized the plight of the women under the Taliban, I also found that American women really stand in solidarity with the women in Afghanistan." 

Bush would arrive in Kabul on Wednesday, and spend most of her short stay at the Women's Teacher Training Institute learning about education for women in Afghanistan. She also planned to meet with the country's women who run "micro-enterprises" making rugs and scarves. Education Secretary Margaret Spellings came with Bush on this trip.
