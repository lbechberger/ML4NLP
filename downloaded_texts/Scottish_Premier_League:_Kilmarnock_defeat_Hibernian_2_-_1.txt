In the Scottish Premier League (SPL), Kilmarnock F.C. defeated Hibernian F.C. 2-1 on Saturday. Nine minutes into the game in Rugby Park, Kilmarnock, Scotland, Liam Kelly became the first player of the game to score for Kilmarnock. He achieved a second goal for his team 43 minutes after the game commenced.

In the second half of the match on the snow-covered field, Derek Riordan scored one goal for his team Hibernian at 55 minutes, which was also his 100th career goal for the team. Liam Miller of Hibernian was given a red card after clipping Conor Sammon 80 minutes into the game. Referee Craig Thomson decided this rulebreaking occurred immediately outside of the penalty area.

Kilmarnock's position in the SPL table now increases to fifth. Meanwhile, Hibernian remain at ninth. Colin Calderwood, the Hibernian manager, said of the match "[w]e've always got to be aware that [Kilmarnock] have got something to protect and we've got nothing to lose", in an interview available on the BBC Sport website. "The attitude and the sort of tempo of how we're going about it in the second half is just sort of the place in the right direction where I feel we've gotta go."

In a separate BBC Sport interview, Kilmarnock manager Mixu Paatelainen commented: "I thought for the first half we were excellent. You know, the surface was quite tricky today because it was a little bit snowy and the ball skids along but, you know, that possibly helped our passing game. You know, [Liam Kelly] was sharp, he was quick, he passed round players and he scored two excellent goals. The second half was a little bit stickier for us, owing to Hibs. They're a good team. They put us under pressure but, you know, thankfully our defence did their job and we only conceded one goal which was a fantastic strike from Riordan."
