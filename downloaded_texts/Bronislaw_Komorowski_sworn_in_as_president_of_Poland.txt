Polish politician Bronisław Komorowski has been sworn in as president of Poland after winning the presidency in the presidential runoff election of July 4. Komorowski belongs to the Civic Platform Party and won the presidential runoff by a margin of 53% to 47% against Jarosław Kaczyński, who is from the Law and Justice party. Kaczyński was the twin brother of former President Lech Kaczyński, who died in an airplane accident in Russia.

The new president had held the post as acting speaker of parliament (the Sejm) since April 10 of this year. He assumed the presidency after the plane crash in Smolensk, Russia that killed 95 political figures, including the president.

Civic Platform is a liberal conservative political party while Law and Justice is conservative and has an "anti-corruption, conservative, law and order agenda." 

Komorowski, 58, is the fourth President of Poland since the fall of communism. He has called for more cooperation and less fighting and hatred in the political arena. "The democratic institutional order we have built in Poland for over 20 years of change has shown that in these difficult times, we have been able to ensure continuity of the state to tax and proudly pays tribute to disaster victims," Komorowski said.
