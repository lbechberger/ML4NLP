 q|What Ronaldo does you cannot name. It is on another historic level,[...]It is incredible what he has done in only six years, scoring an average of more than 50 goals a season, when it used to be hard for me to reach 20. I hope he keeps scoring many more goals for a long time and helps the team to win titles. -Raúl Speaking to Marca
