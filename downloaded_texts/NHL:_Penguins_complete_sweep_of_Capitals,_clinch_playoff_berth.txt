The Pittsburgh Penguins secured a spot in the 2007 Stanley Cup Playoffs when they defeated the Washington Capitals Thursday night, before 18,227 at the Verizon Center.

The Capitals got off to a fast start, after Washington's Alexander Semin took a pass from Alexander Ovechkin, and backhanded it past Pittsburgh goalie Marc-Andre Fleury at 5:59 in the first period. Less than five minutes later, Boyd Gordon would double the Capitals lead, scoring his 6th goal of the season. Michel Ouellet took advantage of a Penguins power play at 12:08, sending an Erik Christinsen pass past Olaf Kolzig to narrow the Capitals lead to one goal. Pittsburgh dominated the second period, with Sidney Crosby picking up his 35th goal in between two goals by Ryan Whitney. In a last minute desprate attempt at a comeback, Milan Jurcina scored to make it 4-3. Unfortunatley for the Capitals, Jurcina's goal came with only 32 seconds remaining in regulation. Washington was unable to score again, lifting the Penguins to victory, and securing their berth into the 2007 Stanley Cup Playoffs.

Washington has dropped 13 of their last 15 games while the Penguins have won 3 strait. The Caps return to the ice Friday, when they will travel to Miami to battle the Panthers. The Pens will travel to Boston to take on the Bruins, Thursday. The Penguins defeated Boston 5-0 Sunday afternoon in Pittsburgh.
