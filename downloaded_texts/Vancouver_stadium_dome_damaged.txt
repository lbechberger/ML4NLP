The inflatable roof covering BC Place Stadium in Vancouver, British Columbia was intentionally collapsed in a "controlled deflation" on Friday after a section of the dome was ripped open. As the seven-metre tear became caught in the wind, it began to make loud noises, which one stadium worker described as similar to "elephants running through your living room". The venue was evacuated and no one was reported injured. Windy weather conditions are blamed for the damage. Officials have not yet indicated when roof repairs can be completed to allow the facility to re-open.

BC Place Stadium was opened in June 1983 and is scheduled as a key venue for the 2010 Winter Olympics. The roof costs $300,000 per year to maintain.
