Just a few hours after fire crews put out a suspected arson fire, another fire hit the large Muslim building. The building has now been completely destroyed, a spokesman for the Dutch police said.

The building was engulfed in flames on Saturday morning. Authorities are investigating and do not rule out a possibility that it was arson.

A Turkish mosque that was located in the building has been there for over 14 years and relations with visitors and the neighborhood are fine, according to police.

Both fires didn't result in any injuries but after the second fire on Saturday, the buildings has been completely destroyed and police fear the entire building could collapse.
