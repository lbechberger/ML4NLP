HMS Superb, a navy submarine from the United Kingdom, crashed into rocks in the northern half of the Red Sea on May 26. The UK Ministry of Defence (MoD) released a statement saying, "there were no casualties and the submarine remains watertight, is safe on the surface and able to operate under its own power."

The MoD also said that "the submarine's nuclear reactor is completely unaffected, and there is no environmental impact."

BBC News has reported that an investigation will be launched to discover the cause of the incident.

According to the MoD, "no other vessel, military or civil, was involved in the incident." The MoD has stated that the process of informing the relatives of the crew is underway.
