The U.S. State Department has called for sanctions against Iran and has also said that Iran has not indicated to the United Nations that they intend to follow through with halting their nuclear program. 

"We would expect that the parties would immediately begin formal discussions about a resolution that would call for sanctions," said spokesman for the State Dapartment, Sean McCormack.

"[Sanctions] have been our intention for some months, it remains our intention, it'll be our intention on September the first if the Iranians don't comply with the resolution," said John R. Bolton, the U.S. embassador to the United Nations.

Today, the Washington Post reported that the International Atomic Energy Agency will report to the U.N. tomorrow that Iran is still enriching Uranium despite a U.N. resolution calling for the country to halt its nuclear program.

The Chinese Foreign Minister Li Zhaoxing however, has called for a "diplomatic resolution" to Iran's nuclear program.

Iran's President, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said that sanctions will not stop Iran from their "lofty goals of progress." He also said that Europe should "be independent [from the U.S.] in decision-making and to settle problems through negotiations" in regards to Iran's nuclear program.

The deadline set by the U.N. is set to expire on August 31.
