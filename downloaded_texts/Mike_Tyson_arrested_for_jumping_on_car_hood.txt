Former heavyweight boxer Mike Tyson was arrested on Tuesday for allegedly jumping on the hood of a man's car outside a nightclub in late November. The incident occurred at 1 a.m. at the Pussycat Lounge. The driver of the car, who identified himself as "Asaf Alikadic" to authorities, claimed that Tyson jumped on the hood of his car while he was leaving the nightclub, causing $1,400 in damage to the vehicle. The man does not plan to press charges but wants the damages paid for.

Tyson has a history of criminal behavior and violence outside of the boxing ring. Among other incidents Tyson has served time for rape, has been in litigation and had criminal charges brought against him for other altercations involving automobiles. Inside the boxing ring, Tyson is only a shadow of his former self. 

Tyson was released after being given a citation. A court date is to be scheduled within ten days.
