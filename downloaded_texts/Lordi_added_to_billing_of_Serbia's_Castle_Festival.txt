Finnish theatrical hard rock band Lordi have been added to the billing of the upcoming Castle Festival in Serbia.

The event will take place at the Smederevo Fortress in Smederevo across July 1-5. Over 70 bands will perform at the festival.

Festival organisers released a statement saying “Lordi is very popular in Serbia amongst heavy metal bands. They revolutionised Eurovision with their rock song”. This refers to Lordi's victory at the 2006 Eurovision Song Contest, at which their song Hard Rock Hallelujah scored a record 292 points and gave Finland their first win at the contest.

The bands scheduled span a wide range of rock and metal genres. Amongst the other acts already confirmed to appear are Judas Priest, Helloween, Soilwork, Ensiferum, At The Gates, Avantasia, Sodom, Dismember, Saturnus, Manticora and Sybreed.
