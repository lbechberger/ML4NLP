United States Congressman and 2008 presidential candidate Dennis Kucinich has decided to quit his bid for the presidency and Democratic nomination. 

Kucinich noted in the Cleveland Plain Dealer on a interview on Thursday, that the Cleveland local and former mayor of the city was "transitioning out of the Democratic Presidential primary race" to focus on a "new direction." This comes a month after his youngest brother, Perry Kucinich, who had paranoid schizophrenia, was found dead. Kucinich told the Plain-Dealer he would make a longer statement on Friday.

Instead, Kucinich is going to focus on his re-election bid to the United States House of Representatives because he is facing four other candidates in the Democratic primary for Ohio's 10th congressional district and has received criticism for spending more time on running for President than on the district which he has represented for the past 12 years. 

Kucinich has said he will not endorse another Democrat in the primary. This was his second run for the presidency, his first was the 2004 presidential election.
