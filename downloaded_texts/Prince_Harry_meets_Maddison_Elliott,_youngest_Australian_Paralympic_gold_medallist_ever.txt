London, Englandâ€” Prince Harry met Paralympic swimmer Maddison Elliott Tuesday morning at the Aquatic Centre in the Olympic Park. So far, Elliott has won a gold in the Women's 4 x 100 metres Freestyle Relay in world record time, a silver in the Women's 50 metres Freestyle S8 event and bronze in the Women's 400 metres Freestyle S8 event.

Aged thirteen, Elliott is the youngest member of the Australian Paralympic Team, and the youngest Australian Paralympian to ever win a medal at the Games. Coming to London, accomplishing this feat was one of her personal goals. Following Elliott's Games qualification, her coach told the Sydney Morning Herald, "She is ranked just out of medals in about four of her events but obviously at her age they can drop huge times whereas the girls who are between 20 and 30 might only drop tenths of seconds."

In her other events, Maddison finished sixth in the women's 100 metres butterfly S8 event, women's 100 metres backstroke S8 event and women's 200 metres individual medley SM8 event.
