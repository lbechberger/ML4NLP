A British couple have died after their car collided with a bus carrying a group of children. The crash took part on the A64 at Staxton near Scarborough, North Yorkshire on Sunday morning. The bus continued on through a hedge line and hit an unoccupied camper van. Six passengers on the bus were treated for minor injuries.

Detective Inspector Geoff Carey of the North Yorkshire Police said that "The coach was carrying a group of young people as well as adults and they are very shocked. They have slight injuries but a great deal of shock." He also commented on the after crash saying that "Had the Winnebago not been there the bus could have gone into the house."

The bus was traveling from Pelsall to Primrose Valley holiday park in North Yorkshire to attend marching band competition when the accident happened.

The North Yorkshire police were unable to give any more details. The A64 was closed in both directions at Staxton at the junction with the B1249. Motorists were advised to avoid the area, which has become congested, according to police.
