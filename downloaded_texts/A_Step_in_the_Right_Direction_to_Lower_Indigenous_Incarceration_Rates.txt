The rates of Indigneous incarceration rates and deaths in custody are continually rising. The Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody held in 1991 gave over 300 recommendations, all of which would improve the statistics, yet the indigenous incarceration rates are continually rising, and the amount of deaths in custody is also increasing. The Social Justice Commissioner, Mick Gooda says, ‘It's almost like the Royal commission never happened. We're revisiting some of those sort of issues right now.’

The Aboriginal Elder, Noel Nannup’s nephew took his own life last week while finishing up his sentence in Perth’s maximum security prison. He says about his nephews death, ‘In some ways, I guess I'm used to it. It shocks me to have to say that, but that's all we know is - there's been deaths in custody since who knows how long.’ 
Another issue linked to indigenous incarceration rates and deaths in custody is the state of the prisoner when they enter prison. Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD), is something that affects many indigenous youth, and when those with the syndrome are convicted of crimes they have committed they are not tested for the syndrome first. This can lead to several issues once the youth have been incarcerated.
 Perth Children’s Court magistrate Catherine Crawford says that, ‘It’s likely that 25 per cent of youth incarcerated in Australia may be FASD-affected, due to higher rates of alcohol consumption relative to other countries.’

The West Australian Corrective Services Department is currently developing a screening test for those affected by FASD as well as Joe Francis, the West Australian Corrective Service Minister giving $195,000 to the University of Western Australia to help develop what is called a Fastrack Clinic which can be used with a Medicare rebate. Both initiatives a step in the right direction to following the recommendations of the Royal Commission, to reduce Indigenous incarceration rates and deaths in custody.
