South African Premier Soccer League club, Kaizer Chiefs could be in hot water again. Less than a year after the club was fined for badly behaved fans, last night saw some of the 6000 atendees go on the rampage after the Johannesburg based club lost to Bidvest Wits University by 2 goals to nil.

Kaizer Chiefs coach Ernst Middendorp, as well as players had to run for cover as fans ripped up chairs and hurled them onto the field to express their disappointment at a poor start to the season. So far Kaizer Chief's, one of South Africa's premier soccer clubs, have yet to win a game in this season.

Last year, the club was penalised by being made to play two games behind closed doors but after months of legal wrangling, the PSL decided to lower the punishment to just one game.

Comment is still pending from the soccer league and the club.
