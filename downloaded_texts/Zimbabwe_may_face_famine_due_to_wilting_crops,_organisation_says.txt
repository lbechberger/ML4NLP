The US-funded Famine Early Warning System Network (FEWSNET) has said that Zimbabwe may face famine this year, due to wilting crops caused by poor rains. The organisation added that more than two million Zimbabweans would require food aid between now and March.

“Since December, below-average precipitation and above-average temperatures continue to help strengthen seasonal moisture deficits across central Mozambique, southern Malawi, southern Madagascar and southern Zimbabwe,” FEWSNET said.

FEWSNET remarked that low amounts and rainfall, coupled with high temperatures, could result in crop failures in regions like Masvingo, Gwanda, Bulawayo and part of Manicaland.

It also said that the World Food Programme is intending to increase food aid measures in the country. FEWSNET's estimate for the number of food-insecure people in Zimbabwe is now at 2.2 million, above the 1.7 million estimate for October through December.
