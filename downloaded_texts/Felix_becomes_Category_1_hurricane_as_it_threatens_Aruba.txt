The sixth named storm and second hurricane of the 2007 Atlantic hurricane season is in full swing and headed toward Aruba. Hurricane Felix gathered strength all day Saturday and pounded Grenada with heavy rains and wind. Hurricane Felix snapped small boats loose from their moorings and even toppled utility poles as it heads toward the Caribbean island of Aruba.

Felix was upgraded from a tropical storm to a hurricane Saturday evening as it sustained maximum winds of 120 kilometers an hour. 

Hurricane Felix swept over Grenada on Saturday. Felix had such strength that local radio and TV stations were knocked out of service and utility poles were toppled. At this point, no injuries are reported. The storm did, however, rip two roofs off at least two homes and a popular concert venue was demolished.
