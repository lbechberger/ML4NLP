Jovan Belcher, an American football player for the Kansas City Chiefs, on Saturday shot his girlfriend Kasandra Perkins and then later shot himself.

According to Police Captain David Lindaman, Perkins and Belcher got into an argument at their house and Belcher shot Perkins around 7:50 A.M. CT. After shooting Perkins, Belcher headed to the Chiefs training facility where he talked to Chiefs General Manger Scott Pioli and Head Coach Romeo Crennel. Belcher thanked them for their support and then proceeded to shoot himself.

Owner of the Kansas City Chiefs Clark Hunt released a statement regarding Belcher. He said "The entire Chiefs family is deeply saddened by todayâ€™s events, and our collective hearts are heavy with sympathy, thoughts and prayers for the families and friends affected by this unthinkable tragedy. We sincerely appreciate the expressions of sympathy and support we have received from so many in the Kansas City and NFL communities, and ask for continued prayers for the loved ones of those impacted. We will continue to fully cooperate with the authorities and work to ensure that the appropriate counseling resources are available to all members of the organization."

Belcher, from the University of Maine, went undrafted in 2009, but was signed as a free agent after the draft.
