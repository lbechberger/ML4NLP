The Romanian government has asked the Islamic terrorists who kidnapped three Romanian journalists in late March to release one of the journalists, Marie-Jeanne Ion, aged 30, who is the only female in the group. The government has confirmed that the three journalists are all still alive, even though the terrorists, who call themselves the Muadh ibn Jabal Brigades, stated that they would kill them by last Wednesday unless Romania withdraws its troops from Iraq.

 

Romanian Prime Minister Călin Popescu-Tăriceanu said that all efforts were being made to save the journalists. He said, "In principle, authorities are in contact with the kidnappers but I can't say any more."

The terrorists have until yet not responded to the government's request to release Ion. Ion's father, who is a senator from the Social Democratic Party, urged the Parliament to take a stand on the kidnappers' demands. He said, "If we don't take a stand, we will probably have a day of mourning that senators and deputies will remember."

 

Romanian lawmakers have expressed solidarity with the families of the hostages, and passed a resolution calling on the government to inform the Parliament about any options being weighed for the hostages' release. The document also requested that the Supreme Defense Council analyses the situation, as only the Council and the Romanian President, Traian Băsescu, have the right to decide on military withdrawal from Iraq.
