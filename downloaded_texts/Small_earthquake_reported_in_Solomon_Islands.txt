According to the United States Geological Survey a magnitude 5.5 earthquake hit the Solomon Islands at approximately 09:12:20 (UTC).

The epicenter was located 40 km [25 miles] south east of Gizo, New Georgia Islands in the Solomon Isle.

It is not known if there is any damage associated with the tremor, but shake maps from the USGS say that "light to moderate" damage could be reported.

On April 4, a magnitude 6.2 earthquake struck the same area. Before that, two quakes measuring 6.0 struck in roughly the same area. There were no reports of damage with any of those quakes. These follow the massive 8.1 magnitude quake that struck on April 1 that triggered a tsunami killing at least 15 people.
