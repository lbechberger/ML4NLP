At least 16 soldiers and militants - possibly more - were killed in Pakistan Saturday during an ambush by the Taliban. According to the Pakistan Television Corporation, hundreds of militants stormed a convoy of Pakistani paramilitary forces. An unknown number of civilians were reported to be among the dead. This comes one day after militants took 29 security personal hostage, threatening to kill them if seven of their allies were not released from jail.

According to the chief of the Interior Ministry, Rehman Malik, the paramilitary forces had been deployed to the area in search of 19 kidnapped government officials. "I strongly condemn the killing of Frontier Constabulary personnel and salute them for their courage and valour," said Pakistani Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani.
