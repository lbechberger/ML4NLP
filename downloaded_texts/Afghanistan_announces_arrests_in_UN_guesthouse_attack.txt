Afghanistan authorities said on Saturday that they have arrested at least six people believed to have been involved in Wednesday's deadly attack on a United Nations guesthouse in Kabul. Afghan intelligence chief Amrullah Saleh announced the arrests on Saturday.

The assault, lead by militants linked to the Taliban and al-Qaeda, killed five foreign UN employees and at least two Afghan guards. The three attackers also were killed. The Taliban said the attack was the first step in a plan to disrupt Afghanistan's November 7 presidential runoff election.

Militants stormed the UN residence around dawn wearing suicide vests. UN security officers battled them for at least an hour before NATO troops and Afghan police showed up.

UN officials have called for a strengthening of security measures after the incident.
