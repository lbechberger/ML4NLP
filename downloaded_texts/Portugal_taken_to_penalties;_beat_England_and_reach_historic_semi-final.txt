Portugal reached the semi-final of the Fifa World Cup for the first time since 1966 after a penalty shootout win over England, Saturday.

Ricardo was the hero for Portugal making three saves to defeat a resolute England team that had been down to 10 men since 62 minutes.



Portugal were the better team on the day having got twice as many shots than England and 57 per cent of ball possession. Ronaldo was a terror holding down England's left flank. 

However; England's excellent defending kept the score level for 120 minutes. Portugal captain Luis Figo was one of Portugal's less effective players due to England's quickness into the challenge and was substituted for Helder Postiga on 86 minutes.

Owen Hargreaves won the Fifa Man of the Match award for many important tackles breaking up dangerous Portugal plays near the England penalty area. The crowd in the Veltins Arena enjoyed the drama of penalties in part due to the hard work of the Bayern Munich player, particularly when England were down to ten.

The turning point of an uneventful first hour, which saw neither keeper troubled, was Wayne Rooney's sending off. The striker was visibly frustrated with his lone role in England's attack and with two Portugal players attempting to tackle alerted the attention of Horacio Elizondo. A red card rose above the melee in front of the referee and Rooney was off to the dressing room.

Portugal used the extra-man to apply more pressure on England's goal, with Miguel getting to England's goal line. But Luiz Felipe Scolari's team did not finish well. Paul Robinson made nine saves but none tested him. 

In extra-time England mounted counter attacks but did not cross well and managed only four shots on target in the game.

Portugal won on penalties against England in the Euro 2004 championship and after Frank Lampard's effort was saved by the magnificent Ricardo the result did not look like it would go any other way.
