Robert Mugabe, the President of Zimbabwe and leader of the Zimbabwe African National Union â€“ Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF), has said in a speech that any votes for his opposition, the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) would be a wasted vote. He stated, "You can vote for them [MDC] but that will be a wasted vote. You will be cheating yourself as there is no way we can allow them to rule this country." He continued by saying that "We [ZANU-PF] have a job to do and that is to protect our heritage. The MDC will not rule this country. It will never, ever happen."

In the speech Mr. Mugabe also claimed that the situation with healthcare in the country is good. He said that "I have bought scanning machines which can see right into the liver in one's body, in detail, what we go to South Africa for. They will be distributed to all major hospitals and, in future, there would be no need to go to South Africa for medical attention."

Mr. Mugabe also claimed that the issue of the maize shortage would be resolved soon. He said that "the railway lines from Zambia and South Africa pass through here. I cannot understand that. But since a lot of maize is still outside the country and being delivered, we will correct that."
