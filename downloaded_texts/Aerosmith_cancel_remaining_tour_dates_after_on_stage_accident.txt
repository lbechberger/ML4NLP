Aerosmith have cancelled their remaining concerts on their tour. The rock band was due to tour the United States and Canada until September 16. They have cancelled the tour after lead singer Steven Tyler was injured after he fell off stage while performing on August 5. 

Tyler suffered a broken shoulder and injuries to the head as the band played in front of a crowd in South Dakota. He was airlifted to hospital after the fall, and later travelled to Boston to see his own doctor. Doctors advised him to recuperate as he rests his shoulder. 

The group made the announcement saying they had “great regret” for cancelling the tour. Guitarist Joe Perry said "words can't express the sadness I feel for having to cancel this tour," while guitarist Brad Whitford wished Tyler a “speedy recovery”. 

The injured Tyler released a statement, saying “I'm plain grateful that I didn't break my neck” and thanked the police and medical staff for their help.
