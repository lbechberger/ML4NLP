Yesterday, on in Madrid, Spain, a small protest demanding justice for victims of the Franco regime was held in Puerta del Sol for an hour starting around 8:00 pm local time .

One sign said "Contra la Impunidad Solidaridad con las víctimas del Franquismo", which translates to "Against Impunity, Solidarity with victims of the Franco regime". The protest started with speakers on a megaphone, and was followed by a march around the plaza several times with the leaders holding a large banner. They were followed by people chanting, holding flags of the Second Spanish Republic, and holding placards. There was a police presence around the protest.

Puerta del Sol has historically been important as a place for Spaniards to hold protests about concerns they have in the country including ones that coincided with the 2011 Arab Spring that demanded changes to Spain's political systems.
