Kiril Georgiev, a Bulgarian chess grandmaster, began playing 360 simultaneous games of chess on Saturday, in an attempt to break the world record for the most games played simultaneously. The games are being hosted at the Inter Expo Centre in Sofia, the capital of Bulgaria.

The current record for the largest number of simultaneous games belongs to the Hungarian-American grandmaster Susan Polgar, who played 326 games in 2005, losing three games, drawing fourteen, and winning the other 309.

To beat that record, Georgiev must win at least four-fifths of his games.

According to the Bulgarian News Network, Georgiev is a former under-18 world champion, and won the Bulgarian national championship three times.
