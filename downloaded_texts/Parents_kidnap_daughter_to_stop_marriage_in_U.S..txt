On Friday, August 4, bride-to-be Julianna Redd's parents, Lemeul and Julia Redd, told her that she was going on a shopping trip but instead she was driven 390 km (240 miles) from Provo, Utah to Grand Junction, Colorado by her parents trying to talk her out of getting married.


Her now husband, Perry Myers, called the police when Julianna and her parents did not attend the pre-wedding dinner. 

The Redds spent the night in Colorado before going to Provo the day the couple were supposed to be married at 
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Temple in Salt Lake City, Utah.

They were married at the temple on Tuesday, August 8.

Julianna Myers said she will be pressing charges.

"I was totally confused and manipulated," she said.

"I've never had a case quite like this," said Utah County Attorney Kay Bryson, after charging Lemuel and Julia Redd.

"It is strange that parents would go to that extent to keep an adult daughter from marrying the man that she had chosen to marry."

Lemuel, 59, and Julia, 56, are expected to be in court on Thursday, October 26 facing charges of second degree felony kidnapping. If convicted they could face one to 15 years imprisonment.

The couple, both students at Brigham Young University, are expecting their first child in May.
