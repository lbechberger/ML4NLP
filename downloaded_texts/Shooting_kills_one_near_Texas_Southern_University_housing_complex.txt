A shooting near the student housing complex of Texas Southern University, in Houston, Texas, on Friday has killed one student, and left another person injured in serious, but stable, condition.



John Rudley, president of the university, identified the unnamed deceased victim as a freshman student. He was sent to hospital and subsequently pronounced dead, according to a press release from Eva Pickens, spokesperson of the university. 



Students were asked to report all suspicious activities to authorities, regardless of "how minor it may seem", campus police said in a press release. The police said they will increase presence on campus.

The school was initially locked-down soon after the shooting, but the lockdown was released for all parts of the campus but a single building, Courtyard Building 1, according to a press release. Classes were planned to resume on Monday.

Britnney Solomon, a psychology student, said that she was planning on moving to the campus dorms, and that she was "concerned" about the shooting. She described it as "nerve racking", the Associated Press reported.

The shooting came after another shooting last week killed nine people at the campus of Umpqua Community College. The shooting caused President of the United States Barack Obama to call for stricter gun control methods in a speech lasting twelve minutes.
