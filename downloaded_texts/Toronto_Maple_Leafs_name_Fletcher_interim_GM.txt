The struggling Toronto Maple Leafs National Hockey League team is under new, interim management this week. Leafs General Manager John Ferguson, Jr. was replaced by Cliff Fetcher. Ferguson's contract was due to expire at the end of June. Fletcher was the Leafs' General Manager from 1991 to 1997.

The new management began on a positive note as the Leafs won 3-2 over the Washington Capitals on Wednesday.
