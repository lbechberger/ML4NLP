For the last few days, Egypt has sporadically opened and closed the Rafah Border Crossing with the Gaza Strip.

On Thursday, Egypt opened the Rafah Border Crossing for a limited time to transfer only 11 wounded, out of dozens of Gaza residents injured during the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, which has intensified significantly lately. The 11 wounded were to be sent for medical treatment in several hospitals, North Sinai's Governor Abdel Fatah Harhor told MENA news agency. On Friday, the crossing closed again, and then opened Saturday for food and medical supplies to be transported into Gaza. Monday, pilgrims were allowed to cross into Egypt, so they will be able to travel to Mecca to fulfil Islamic traditions.

"What is happening in Gaza is disgusting", MENA quoted Egyptian Foreign Ministry spokesman Badr Abdelatty, "Israel has to stop its assault on Gaza."

Mohamed Morsi during his tenure as President of Egypt strengthened the connection between Egypt and the Gaza Strip. At the end of 2012, his government aided the coordination between the two sides and advanced a peace. Since the removal of president Morsi by the military and election of the current president, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, the Egyptian army has destroyed tunnels that had been dug between Gaza and Sinai, through which resources had been smuggled.
