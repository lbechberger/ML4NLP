At 2:02 UTC on February 28, 2006, the millionth user account for the English Wikipedia project was created. The user is known as Romulus32, though little else is known about this person. Jfingers88 first identified this account as the one millionth, and this fact was confirmed by Jacoplane and Titoxd. 

Recently, there has been increasing excitement concerning the still impending millionth article for the English Wikipedia. However, little attention has been called to the number of users, which has just passed a million, and continues to grow much faster than the number of articles. 

Wikimedia founder Jimbo Wales has yet to comment on this milestone for Wikipedia and Wikimedia.
