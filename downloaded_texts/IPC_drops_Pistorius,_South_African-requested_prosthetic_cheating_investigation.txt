London, England â€” At an International Paralympic Committee (IPC) press conference this morning, they announced unless the South Africa Paralympic Committee could provide evidence that athletes were changing prosthetics, in violation of the rules, the IPC would be dropping their cheating investigation.

The investigation was launched after the South African Paralympic Committee sent the IPC a formal letter of complaint following Oscar Pistorius raising concerns in the mixed zone following his silver medal finish in the 200 meters. The South Africans alleged runners from other countries were cheating by being measured using one set of competition prosthetics, then using different prosthetics during the race.

The IPC sent representatives to the track to ask coaches if they were aware of changes between prosthetics being measured and being used on the track. According to the IPC, coaches were surprised to be asked this, as it would be extremely difficult to transition between differing prosthetics due to required changes in stride.

Sebastion Coe, London Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games President, said Oscar had made his comments on possible cheating in the heat of the moment, and the organization should not be involved in situations like the one with Pistorius.
