British pop group Girls Aloud have won the 2005 Popjustice £20 Music Prize with their single "Wake Me Up". The award, organised by music journalist Peter Robinson, is given annually to the best British pop single of the previous 12 months and is a tongue-in-cheek response to the Mercury Music Prize, the winner of which was announced earlier in the evening.

This year's shortlist included Basement Jaxx, Robbie Williams and Charlotte Church.

This is the second time Girls Aloud have won the award - they won the inaugural prize in 2003 for "No Good Advice".

Also announced was the winner of the £20 Invoice Prize for the worst British single of the previous 12 months. The winner, charity single Band Aid 20's "Do They Know It's Christmas?", was the UK's Christmas number one in 2004.
