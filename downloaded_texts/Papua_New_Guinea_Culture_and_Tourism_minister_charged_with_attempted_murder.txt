Police in Papua New Guinea have arrested the Culture and Tourism Minister, Guma Wau, and charged him with attempted murder. The host of Radio Australia's Pacific Beat programme, Firmin Nanol, reported that the minister was charged and detained for an hour before being released on bail in connection with the shooting of a 50 year old man on June 13.

Minister Wau has said that he was driving through Kerowagi district when the road was blocked by local tribesmen who refused to let him pass, and as a result of this, he fired his pistol to break the crowd up. One of the bullets strayed and hit a local man, 50 year old John Agaundo, wounding him.

Police in Chimbu have confiscated his pistol for examination. Minister Wau is due to appear before Kundiawa District Court today.
