NASA's Swift satellite has completed all tests since
its launch last November and with the Ultravioliet/Optical Telescope
(UVOT) now on line, is now fully functional for the mission's 2 year quest
for gamma-ray bursts.



The UVOT was tested on the Pinwheel Galaxy (M101).

"After many years of effort building the UVOT, it was exciting to
point it toward the famous Pinwheel Galaxy, M101," said Dr. Peter
Roming, UVOT Lead Scientist at Penn State University. "The ultraviolet
wavelengths in particular reveal regions of star formation in the
galaxy's wispy spiral arms. But more than a pretty image, this
first-light observation is a test of the UVOT's capabilities."

Gamma ray bursts are some of the most powerful objects observed
in the Universe and are thought to signal the birth of black
holes.

Swift is designed to detect the bursts and automatically
re-orient itself to gather images and data of the phenomenon.
Swift detected and imaged its first official burst on January 17,
2005, before the UVOT was operational with the aid of the Burst
Alert (BAT) and X-ray (XRT) telescopes activated several weeks
earlier. The BAT detects the gamma-ray bursts, automatically and
immediately turns the telescope, bringing the XRT
and UVOT to bear on the location of the event which record
detailed observations of the burst afterglow.

The UVOT is a joint product of Penn State University and the Mullard Space
Science Laboratory.
