A North Korean Military official has said that if the United States does not "resolve its standoff with Pyongyang" that North Korea may conduct additional tests and deploy nuclear weapons on its missiles. 

"We hope the situation will be resolved before an unfortunate incident of us firing a nuclear missile comes. That depends on how the US acts," an unnamed N. Korean military official told the South Korean news agency Yonhap.

The official goes on to say that the test of a nuclear weapon was an "expression of intentions" to get the U.S. to face the country.

"The nuclear test is an expression of our intention to face the United States across the negotiating table," said the official.

The official also said that the sanctions against N. Korea are "not a solution." and "never" will be a solution.

"We have lost enough. Sanctions can never be a solution. We still have a willingness to give up nuclear weapons and return to six-party talks as well. It's possible whenever the US takes corresponding measures," said the official.

The U.S. has declined an offer by N. Korea to have talks with the country one on one saying that the U.S. will not be "intimidated" by N. Korea.
