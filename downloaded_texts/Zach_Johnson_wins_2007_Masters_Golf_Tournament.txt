Zach Johnson won the 2007 Masters Golf Tournament in Augusta, Georgia Sunday. His score of +1 over par (289) is the second highest score ever recorded for the Masters. He was two strokes ahead of three runners up, Tiger Woods, Retief Goosen, and Rory Sabbatini.

This is Johnson's first win in a Major Championship, and second PGA win. He finished in 17th place in the 2005 PGA Championship, but was cut from the British Open three years in a row. Johnson netted $1,305,000 USD for this win.

Tiger Woods, four-time Masters winner and score record holder for the tournament, said "This one's not disappointing, I threw this tournament away on two days when I had two good rounds and I [finished] bogey, bogey. So four bogeys in the last two holes basically cost me the tournament." Woods failed to finish any of the four rounds below par.
