Human Rights Secretary NilmÃ¡rio Miranda said that Brazil will defend China in the United Nations Commission on Human Rights. According to him, the Chinese showed some advances in the human rights area recently.

Last year Brazil voted for China and helped to stop a discussion on the subject in UN. The only Latin American countries who favored China in 2004 were Brazil and Cuba.
