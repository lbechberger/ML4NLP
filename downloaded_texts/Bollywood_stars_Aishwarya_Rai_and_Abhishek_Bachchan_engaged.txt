Legendary Bollywood actor Amitabh Bachchan has confirmed that his son Abhishek and former Miss World Aishwarya Rai were engaged last evening at a private ceremony at the Bachchans' residence in Mumbai. 

It is believed that the younger Bachchan proposed to his bride-to-be in New York, soon after the Toronto premiere of his new movie Guru. The media had been following the romance between the two closely for some time past, but this is the first time they have come out in the open about their relationship. Rumours that the couple were planning to spread the know began to spread in November last year, when they visited the Sankat Mochan Temple together, with some even saying that they had already been married even earlier at the Meenakshi temple in Madurai

According to one daily, the wedding will take place either on February 19 or March 7 at the Hyatt Mumbai. "The children have decided. We are very happy and thought we should go ahead with the ‘roka’ ceremony. It was held in the evening.", Amitabh Bachchan said of the ceremony, which was attended by the family's close friends, including Samajwadi Party leader Amar Singh, Aishwarya's parents, and industrialist Anil Ambani and the latter's wife Tina Ambani. The couple have now flown to Ujjain to take a holy dip in the Ganga.
