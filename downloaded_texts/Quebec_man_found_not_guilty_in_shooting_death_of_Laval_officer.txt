After four days of deliberation, a jury found Basil Parasiris not guilty Friday in the shooting death of a Laval police Constable in March of 2007.

Laval police were executing a "no knock" warrant on Parasiris' Brossard home March 2, 2007, when Parasiris fatally shot officer Daniel Tessier, thinking he was an invader in his home. The warrant was issued to investigate drug trafficking in the area. Only a small amount of cocaine and marijuana was found during the execution of the search warrant.

Parasiris still faces charges stemming from firearms that were in his possession. The .357 magnum revolver used during the shootout was licensed, but three other loaded firearms were not registered. Parasiris' attorney has indicated that he will plead guilty to those charges.
