After a final piece of videotaped testimony from the accuser in the Michael Jackson case, the defense rested on Friday.

The interview was taped by the Santa Barbara County Sheriff's Department on July 6, 2003. The contents of the tape mostly repeated earlier testimony given by the boy describing Michael Jackson's alleged acts of molestation. Judge Rodney S. Melville instructed the jurors "only to observe the demeanor, manner and attitude of the witness", and that the boy's "statements are not to be considered for the truth of the matter stated."

Closing arguments could begin as early as Wednesday.
