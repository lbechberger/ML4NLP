Gianluca Zambrotta returns to Serie A after agreeing to a contract with AC Milan. He played for FC Barcelona for the past 2 seasons after Juventus FC were demoted after their part of the 2006 Serie A scandal.

According to ESPNSoccernet, AC Milan were looking to bring in Zambrotta for a while.

Zambrotta will miss out on Champions League football for at least 1 season because AC Milan finished in 5th place in Serie A while Barcelona will be in UEFA Champions League in the 3rd qualifying round.

No transfer fee or length of contract was announced.
