Patani Muslim separatists in Thailand have brutally killed &amp; beheaded another man in southern Thailand.

Thai police colonel Thawan Nakarawong said the insurgents entered the shrimp farm where the 45-year-old Burmese man worked and shot him after blindfolding his daughter. Following his murder his head was severed from his body and deposited some 20km away. 

Colonel Thawan commented to the Bangkok Post that the severed head was booby-trapped.

The separatists are believed to be affiliated with the Pattani United Liberation Organization (PULO).

This is the 20th known instance of suspected PULO insurgents beheading a victim, the last was a 41-year-old rubber worker. However, the recent incident has been described as the most gruesome murder since the military coup.
