The Supreme Court of New South Wales has upheld a non-publication order protecting details of a lawsuit filed against Australia's richest person, Gina Rinehart, from being published. The lawsuit filed by Rinehart's daughter, Hope Rinehart Welker, is a dispute based on a trust fund created by Rinehart's father, Lang Hancock. 

The non-publication order was upheld based on the family's wealth, image and any influence the details revealed in court may have on business details. The beneficiaries of the Hope Margaret Hancock Trust are Gina Rinehart, and her four adult children: John, Bianca, Hope and Ginia.

Rinehart is estimated to be worth $10 billion and is the current chairman of Hancock Prospecting, an iron ore business she inherited from her father.
