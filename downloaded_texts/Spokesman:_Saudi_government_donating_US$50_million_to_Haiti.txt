According to a Saudi Arabian foreign ministry spokesman, his country's government is donating US$50 million worth of aid to Haiti to help the victims of the January 12 earthquake there, which killed at least 150,000 people and left hundreds of thousands without homes.

The donation, which is said by Agence France-Presse (AFP) to be the largest made by any Middle Eastern nation, will go through the United Nations fund for Haiti. Among other Middle Eastern countries sending help to Haiti are Israel, the United Arab Emirates, and Jordan. Donations from world governments to the country worldwide total over $1 billion, according to an estimate by the Associated Press.

"The kingdom, by instruction of King Abdullah, is donating 50 million dollars [...] to assist the Haitian people," spokesman Osama Nugali told AFP.

The Organisation of the Islamic Conference, meanwhile, is encouraging Muslim countries to give money to Haiti.
