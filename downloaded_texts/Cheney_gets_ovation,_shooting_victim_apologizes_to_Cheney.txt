Harry Whittington, the person who was shot by Vice President Dick Cheney in a hunting accident, was released from the hospital today. He said to reporters that "My family and I are deeply sorry for all that Vice President Cheney and his family have had to go through this week."

Only minutes later, Cheney received a standing ovation from Wyoming lawmakers. "I want to thank you for that welcome home," Cheney said in his first public appearance after the shooting, when he was addressing the Wyoming state Legislature.

The chief of emergency care Dr. Blanchard, who treated Whittington explained that the reasons for the discharge are Whittington's "excellent health". He added that Whittington was "a lucky person" to survive the shooting.
