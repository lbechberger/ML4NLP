The West Indies beat India by six wickets in the fourth One- Day International at the Port of Spain, to clinch the 5 match series 3-1. The Indian batting order failed again, managing to make only 217/5 at the end of 50 overs. The highest scorer was Mohammad Kaif, who scored 62 runs before being bowled by Dwayne Bravo. The top-order including Sehwag, Dravid and Raina collapsed, with the top three batsmen raking up only 33 runs between them.

The West Indies began the chase strongly, but was dealt an early blow by Phatan who sent Samuels back to the pavilion in the 5th over. Ajit Agarkar dispatched Sarwan for 49 four overs later, putting more pressure on the Windie middle-order. Brian Lara pleased his home fans with a 61-run knock before scooping one to Raina. The skippers' fellow Trinidadian teammate Bravo put up an unbeaten 69, notching his first ODI half-century and pulling the West Indies out of their early slump, in the process. In the end the home-team reached the target of 218 comfortably with 6 overs to spare.

The match was played at the Queen's Park Oval, Port-of-Spain, and Trinidad and was refereed by E.C Broad. The match-umpires were B.R. Doctrove and Simon Taufel. West-Indian veteran S. Bucknor was the T.V umpire. D.J. Bravo was awarded the Man-of-the-match award for his fine performances both with the ball and the willow.
