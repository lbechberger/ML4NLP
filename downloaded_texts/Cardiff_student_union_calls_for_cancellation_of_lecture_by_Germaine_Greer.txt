The Cardiff University student union has called for the cancelling of a November lecture by feminist author and academic Germaine Greer, following comments about transgender star Caitlyn Jenner and other trans women that they have labelled 'transmisogynistic'. 



In an online petition, women's officer Rachael Melhuish asserts that Greer "...has demonstrated time and time again her misogynistic views towards trans women, including continually misgendering trans women and denying the existence of transphobia altogether." 

The petition adds that while debate should be encouraged in universities, Greer's 'problematic' views of trans people, especially trans women were dangerous. 



According to The Guardian, in an interview on BBC2's Newsnight Greer said that Jenner had stolen the limelight from other women in the Kardashian family. 

"It seems to me that what was going on there was that he/she [sic] wanted the limelight that the other... members of the family were enjoying and has conquered it, just like that,â€� Greer said.

According to SameSame.com.au, Greer defended her previous statements denying that trans women were 'real women'. 

Greer stated that she believes she is being pressured not to talk about trans people because of her belief that 'post-operative' trans women are not women. "I'm not saying that people should not be allowed to go through that [gender reassignment] procedure," Greer said. 

Greer clarified her position by stating that "It happens to be an opinion, it's not a prohibition."

This is not the first instance where Greer's statements about trans people has come under criticism. 

In 2012, New Zealand Lesbian, gay, bisexual and trans (LGBT) advocacy group Queer Avengers 'glitter bombed' Greer at a book signing in Wellington. According to SameSame.com.au, the group said at the time: "transphobic feminism is so 20th Century. It wasn't okay then and it's not okay now."
