Promoting her new book If Democrats Had Any Brains They'd Be Republicans, Ann Coulter told a New York City paper:



She continued, saying that she doesn't think it will happen, and says that she places the blame on single women.

The comment, part of an interview published October 2 in the New York Observer, has gained headlines from numerous media outlets.

Megan McArdle of The Atlantic Monthly criticized Coulter's statements. McArdle comments: "Coulter isn't getting away with this because she's a Republican; she's getting away with it because she's a woman. If a conservative male had called for taking away the vote from women, Republicans wouldn't be able to get to the microphone fast enough to denounce him. They know where their political interests lie."

Coulter went on in the interview to blame former Presidents Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter for the September 11, 2001 attacks and criticized women for "voting stupidly".
