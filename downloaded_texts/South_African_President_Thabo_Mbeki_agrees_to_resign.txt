South African President Thabo Mbeki has agreed to a call from the ruling African National Congress to resign.

The ANC announced earlier today that it wanted Mbeki, 66, to resign after two days of talks. He was just months from completing his full term of office, but is caught up in allegations that he influenced a corruption case being brought against rival and ANC leader Jaco Zuma.

Zuma was cleared of all charges on September 12, with the court ruling that Mbeki's regime had interfered. Mbeki and others deny this.

Half of the cabinet is reported to be threatening to walk out if Mbeki does leave. He has called a special government meeting tomorrow to decide how to continue with his removal.

It is unknown who will be named interim ruler by parliament, but it may be Zuma. He may also stand for election to President.
