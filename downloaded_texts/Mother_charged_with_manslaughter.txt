An overseas student who is currently in Dunedin has been charged with manslaughter because of her baby's death.

The 20-year-old will appear in Dunedin Court this afternoon.

Her baby was born in the early hours of Saturday, May 20. The mother was taken to hospital on the same day about 2:30 p.m. because her friends were concerned about her health, she was suffering from internal bleeding. It was later discovered that she had given birth. The baby was found at around 11 p.m. at Studholme College, which was where she was staying.

They interviewed the mother and performed an autopsy on the baby.

Detective Senior Sergeant Tony Wakelin says: "She's obviously quite traumatised still. Physically she's recovering well, but she's got a long way to go psychologically."

Police would not comment on the case any further since the case is now before the courts.
