Mark Nathaniel Anderson, a 16 year-old resident of New Chapel Hill, Texas entered into a plea agreement today relating to the shooting death of his sister. 


The boy stands accused of killing his 19 year-old sister in their home in September 2010. Autopsy reports showed the woman died from 4 gunshot wounds to the head.

He was sentenced to serve a 20-year prison sentence by Judge Jack Skeen, Jr. in the 241st District Court in Tyler; reports note that he will receive credit for time served. The prosecuting attorney noted during proceedings today that Mr. Anderson admitted to a psychologist in January that he had in fact, killed his sister. Last summer, the teen was certified to stand trial as an adult.
