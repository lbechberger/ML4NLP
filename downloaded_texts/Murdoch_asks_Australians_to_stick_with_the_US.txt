Rupert Murdoch, the News Corporation Chairman, told Australians not to allow sentiments over the Iraq War to damage relations with the United States.

Talking at a benefit dinner for the American-Australian Association, in Sydney, Mr. Murdoch cited surveys which have shown that anti-US sentiments to be more prevalent than ever. He warned Australians not to let a rift develop between the two countries.

Mr. Murdoch believes that doubts about the Iraq war should not cloud the relationship stating, "Wars end, administrations come and go". 

"The Australian people must not allow the perfectly legitimate doubts about one policy or one American administration to cloud their long-term judgement."

Mr. Murdoch also touched on the environment during his speech saying both countries must look into new sources of energy to combat climate change.
