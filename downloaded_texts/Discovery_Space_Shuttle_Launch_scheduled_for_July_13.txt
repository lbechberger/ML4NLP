After two days of reviews, NASA managers have scheduled shuttle Discovery for a launch attempt at 1951 UTC or 3:51 p.m. local time in Florida, on July 13. Additional paperwork must be settled, as well as issues regarding the shuttle's body flap, a device that assists in descent at re-entry. If all goes well and the launch takes place on schedule, this will be the 114th launch of the Space shuttle.
