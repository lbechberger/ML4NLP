Morgan Tsvangirai, the leader of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), Zimbabwe's main opposition party, has said that he will pull out of the race to become the president of Zimbabwe. He said that he is doing this because "the outcome [of the elections] is determined by... Mugabe himself," and is therefore not fair.

"We in the MDC have resolved that we will no longer participate in this violent, illegitimate sham of an election process," said Tsvangirai in a press conference made today. "The courageous people of this country and the people of the MDC have done everything humanly and democratically possible to deliver a new Zimbabwe and a new government."

Tsvangirai also said that governments worldwide should intervene to help improve the situation in the country.
