The Anaheim Ducks closed out their series with a win over the Detroit Red Wings Tuesday night, taking the Western Conference finals in six games. The Ducks will meet the Ottawa Senators in the Stanley Cup finals. The schedule for the series was released by the league on Wednesday.

The Senators will visit the Ducks at the Honda Center in Anaheim, California for Game 1 on Monday, May 28 with an 8:00 p.m. EDST (00:00 UTC) start time.

The upcoming series between the Ducks and Senators cannot be compared to any recent history between the two teams. They didn't meet at all during this year's regular season and met only once since the 2004-2005 lock-out and twice since 2002-2003.

When asked for his thoughts on the Ducks, Senators Captain Daniel Alfredsson didn't have much experience to go on. "I haven't seen them much," said Alfredsson. "I've seen them here and there in the playoffs. I think it will be the most physical series we've played in the playoffs so far. They're a bigger team and they've got some skill guys as well."

When asked for an opinion on the Senators, two of the Ducks players weren't much more expressive. "I haven't thought a second about them," said Ryan Getzlaf of the Ducks. "I haven't been watching their games," suggested Teemu Selanne, right-winger for the Ducks.

The Ducks win over the Red Wings indirectly provided some good fortune to the Edmonton Oilers hockey club. Due to a clause in the trade contract that saw the Oilers send Chris Pronger to the Ducks last year, the Oilers were to receive the Ducks first-round draft pick in 2008, if the Ducks made it into the finals.

All games in the finals will have a 8:00 p.m. start time.
