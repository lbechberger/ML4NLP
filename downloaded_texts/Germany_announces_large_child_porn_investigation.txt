Germany has just announced that a large investigation into an online child pornography-ring has yielded 12,000 suspects. The suspects are accused of downloading or possessing illegal images of children.

The investigation, which has been underway for months, is the largest in the country's history.

Speaking on Mitteldeutscher Rundfunk, Peter Vogel, who is heading up the task force, said, "The material was analysed. Then we called for search warrants." The investigators are also looking at suspects in about 70 other countries.
