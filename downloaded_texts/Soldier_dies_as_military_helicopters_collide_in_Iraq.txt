An Iraqi soldier has died after two United States UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters collided and crashed while they attempted to land at an air base in Baghdad.

Two more Iraqis and two US soldiers were wounded. No civilians were injured as the crash occurred over the air base itself, not the densely populated suburb the aircraft had been flying over before.

The crash occurred at 9 p.m. in Azamiyah and is being treated as an accident. An investigation is underway.

There is some dispute over the official version of events. A freelance cameraman who works for the BBC and Reuters said he heard an unusual noise from a single helicopter's engine and describes it crashing with flames and smoke pouring from the engine, and local police say a helicopter was downed by enemy fire.

There are also reports of gunfire after the crash. The US military has denied any knowledge of a shootdown.
