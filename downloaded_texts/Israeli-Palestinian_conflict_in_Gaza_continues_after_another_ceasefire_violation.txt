On Tuesday, an interim ceasefire between Israel and the armed factions in Gaza was broken again, ending the talks between the delegations of both sides in Cairo before a long term agreement could be achieved.

The armed factions in Gaza renewed their rocket launching into Israel, while Israel renewed its targeted bombings in the Gaza Strip, including an apparent attempt to kill Hamas military chief Mohammed Deif, collectively resulting according to Hamas in at least nineteen Palestinian deaths. Reportedly at least 80 rockets have been fired from the Gaza Strip since Tuesday and sirens were heard in many areas across Israel, including Tel Aviv and Jerusalem.



Yesterday , Moussa Abu Marzouk, Hamas' exiled deputy leader, announced on Facebook Israel had tried to kill Mohammed Deif, Hamas military chief since 2002, and "The wife of the great leader was martyred with his daughter". Israeli Interior Minister Gideon Sa'ar commented on the event to Israeli Army Radio, "Mohammed Deif deserves to die just like bin Laden. He is an arch murderer, and as long as we have an opportunity, we will try to kill him". Reports suggest Deif already suffered from a number of disabilities caused by earlier Israeli assassination attempts.
