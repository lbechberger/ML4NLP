Kirk Shepherd is a professional darts player from the United Kingdom. Kirk began playing competitively at 13 for his local pub, and was soon crowned Boys Champion at the Winmau World Masters in 2003. Shepherd was voted Young Player of the Year by the British Darts Organisation in 2005 and 2006.

Shepherd is perhaps best known for his performance at the 2008 PDC World Darts Championship. Forced to qualify for the televised tournament, he then proceeded to knock out a number of well-known players live on television, including Terry Jenkins, Wayne Mardle and former finalist Peter Manley. He ultimately went on to come second in the tournament, becoming the youngest ever finalist, and losing out to John Part in the final.

He has also previously managed to defeat the then world number one, Gary Anderson. Due to his performance at the world championship he will play in this year's Grand Slam of Darts next month. Ahead of that appearance Wikinews was able to conduct an interview with Kirk, which is now available below:
