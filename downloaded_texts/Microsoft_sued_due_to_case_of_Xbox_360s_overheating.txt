A Chicago owner of an Xbox 360 console is filing a class action lawsuit against Microsoft, the company that manufactured the console. The lawsuit is based on the widely circulated claims that the console overheats, resulting in complete lockups of the system or various error messages. 

Robert Bryers, the man who has brought this lawsuit against Microsoft, claims that the company rushed the console to market to beat competitor releases. He further claims that this rushed release resulted in the company including a faulty power supply and central processor that overheats, resulting in the damage of heat-sensitive chips within the console. Microsoft denies that the problems are widespread.

The lawsuit, filed on Friday in an Illinois federal court, seeks unspecified damages and legal fees, as well as a recall and replacement of the affected consoles.
