A new version of Canada's Food Guide was announced by Canadian Health Minister Tony Clement on Feb. 5, 2007. The guide has helped Canadians with healthy eating habits since 1942 but was last updated in 1992. It is the Canadian government's most-requested publication after income tax forms.

Changes to the Food Guide include:

* a first-time recommendation to include a small amount of unsaturated fat in regular diets;
* physical activity to complement healthy eating;
* advice for some people to take vitamin supplements;
* an advisory to limit foods with excess salt, sugar, fat and calories, which is considered an unprecedented caution regarding junk food.
