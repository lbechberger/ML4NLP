Peter William Raeburn Hunter, a 61-year-old stock agent from Hastings, New Zealand, died early yesterday morning from a rampaging friesian bull. The bull first flung recently married Hunter in the air and then gored him at Stortford Lodge saleyards in Hastings.

Hunter had tried to escape into another yard but the bull rammed him against the yard rails. He then fell to the ground but the bull didn't stop attacking him until another agent came to his aid and hit the animal on the nose with a stick.

Bruce Campbell, yards manager, said: "The agent was behind an alleyway gate which the bull lifted off its hinges. It was awful and has given us all a real shake-up."

Hunter was then transported to Hawke's Bay hospital but died before he got to the hospital.

The bull has now been shipped to Palmerston North on a truck to be slaughtered after the police declined the request to shoot the bull dead at the lodge. Acting Sergeant Andy Clinton said: "It calmed down and they had no problems loading it on the truck."

It was the first death at the lodge in the 103 years that it has been operating.

Friesian bulls are not normally dangerous. 

"Peter was very much a valued member of the local team," Elders Livestock, managing director, Stuart Chapman said. "It's a freak accident, an absolute tragedy."
