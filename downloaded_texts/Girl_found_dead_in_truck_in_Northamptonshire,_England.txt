On Saturday 1400 BST, Northamptonshire Police were alerted by an HGV company that a Spar delivery vehicle had gone missing because it had not come back to base. A search discovered the truck on the A605 near Warmington, England. The truck was found in a lorry park near a Jet filling station. The cab was unlocked and the curtains were drawn at the time.

When the police looked inside, they discovered a nine-year-old girl who had been strangled to death. A search by police officers then discovered a forty-year-old man's body hanging from a tree close to the lorry park.

Detective Chief Inspector Tricia Kirk said: "I cannot begin to imagine what the family are going through, and we have family liaison officers with them trying to answer any questions that they may have. At the moment, we are treating it as a murder-suicide. We believe the little girl was murdered and the man then committed suicide." She also said, "While we have not yet ruled out the involvement of a third party, the evidence strongly suggests that it is unlikely that anyone else was involved in the two deaths. This is a tragic incident for two families and we are working closely with them as part of our investigation." 

A police spokesman said, "Both bodies were taken to Leicester Royal Infirmary last night so that forensic post mortems could be carried out." 

The man and the girl cannot be named at this stage but the police have said that the man is the girl's stepfather and that both came from the West Midlands. It is thought that the girl had regarded the trip as a "treat".
