Jamaica has been selected to to host the 2011 CONCACAF under-17 football championship. The tournament will be hosted in western Jamaica from the 12th of February to the 28th. The tournament will decide what four teams will qualify for the 2011 FIFA Under-17 World Cup.

President of the Jamaican Football Federation, Captain Horace Burrell released a statement about the decision. He said "A short while ago (yesterday) CONCACAF confirmed that Jamaica is selected as the host country for the CONCACAF Under-17 Football qualifiers which will take place between February 12 and 28 next year. I am extremely pleased with this decision as it will certainly help to give a fillip to western football development which, in recent times, has been facing numerous challenges."

CONCACAF's general secretary Ted Howard toured the islands facilities in August. Burrell said that he will announce the two locations used for the tournament shortly.
