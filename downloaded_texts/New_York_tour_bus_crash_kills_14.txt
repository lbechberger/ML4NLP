At least fourteen people have died after a chartered bus crashed in The Bronx, New York. According to authorities, the tour bus accident also injured eighteen other people, amongst which five were critically injured.

The vehicle was travelling from Mohegan Sun in Connecticut to the village of Uncasville, also located in Connecticut. When the crash occurred on Interstate 95 at approximately 0535 EST (1035 UTC) on Sunday, there were at least thirty-one passengers present.

40-year-old Ophadell Williams, the driver of the bus, reported to the police that the vehicle came into contact with a semi-trailer truck, which was veering across the interstate. He said that he attempted to move out of the way of this vehicle, causing the bus itself to swerve, overturn and scrape the side of a railing for one hundred yards before impacting with a highway sign's upholding bar.

Captain James Ellson, of the fire service, described the scene as "a pile of humans, either still in their seats or on the floor, wrapped in the metal". Jose Hernandez, one of the survivors of the bus crash, said that "[w]e tried to help people, but there was twisted metal in the way".

The semi-trailer truck driver failed to stop after the accident. Police are currently attempting to detect this driver. Raymond Kelly, the current New York City Police Commissioner, stated that the truck was moving on a lane to the bus' nearside, although whether the vehicles came into contact with each other or not is yet to be confirmed. Both vehicles were travelling at "a significant rate of speed", according to Kelly.
