The Bristol Harbour Festival 2008, which is expected to have 200,000 people attending over the weekend, has been launched in the British city of Bristol. The event features a variety of different bands and circus acts. The festival resulted in the closure of some of the roads in the centre of Bristol. Well known ships from the Royal Navy were also displayed in the event.


Organisers have claimed that the event is the biggest free event in the South West of England. The director of the event told BBC News that "it is a unique opportunity for a weekend of celebrations of the Bristol harbourside and its yachting and shipping history." 

Bristol was a major port in the 18th and 19th century, and the city's involvement in the slave trade, and its abolition in 1807 has been highlighted in previous years of the festival, which was launched in 1871.

The police presence at the festival was high, although no higher than in previous years.
