Lech Kaczyński, conservative politician from Poland, internationally controversial for having refused, as mayor of Warsaw, to authorize the Equality Parade for gay rights on June 11, 2005 in Warsaw, has taken the office of President in the country today, after swearing an oath before the National Assembly (joined houses of Sejm and Senate).

For the first time since 1989 the former presidents of Poland, Lech Wałęsa and Aleksander Kwaśniewski, have been invited to the swearing ceremony. Kaczyński hasn't got the insignia of authority of the Second Republic of Poland, as they were relayed to a museum by Lech Wałęsa, when he ended his term as the president of Poland in 1995.

In his speech, Kaczyński stated that Poland needs a new constitution. Its effect would be the end of the process of building up the new Republic of Poland, called "IV Rzeczpospolita", according to the new president. Kaczyński promised also that he will do everything that he is allowed to do to help lawmakers introduce essential political reforms.

Kaczyński is closely related to the Peace and Justice party, led by his twin brother Jarosław. For the last three years he was a mayor of Warsaw. He's also professor of law at University of Warsaw.
