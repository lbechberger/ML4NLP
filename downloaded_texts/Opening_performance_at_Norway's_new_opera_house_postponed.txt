The opening performance of Oslo's new Opera House is postponed due to security concerns. The late delivery of a critical stage control system means that the opera "Around the World in 80 Days", composed by Gisle Kverndokk, has to be rescheduled for next season.

Opera chief BjÃ¸rn Simensen announced the postponement on Monday, describing it as "dramatic." The performance that will replace "Around the World in 80 Days" is not yet announced. 

The opening gala performance of the new Opera House on April 12th will proceed as planned.
