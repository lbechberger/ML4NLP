Euan Blair, the eldest son of British Prime Minister Tony Blair, has been admitted to a hospital in Barbados after complaining of stomach pains. 

The twenty-two year-old is being treated in the Queen Elizabeth Hospital, near Bridgetown. Andrew Zbar, who is a doctor there, said that he expected Euan to be dismissed from the hospital later today.

Tony Blair and his family had been holidaying on the Caribbean island for the past three weeks. Mr Blair returned home this morning and is back at his office in Number 10. He is said to be keeping up to date with his son's condition.

A spokeswoman from Downing Street said: "We can confirm that Euan Blair was taken into hospital with a stomach complaint."
