An earthquake hit close to the Solomon Islands, in the early hours of Thursday morning. It was about 184 kilometres from Lata and 487 kilometres from the capital Honiara. The US Geological Survey has stated that Tsunami warnings are yet to be released and that no major damage occurred. 

The quake was 6.9 in magnitude and hit a depth of 19 kilometres. It was then followed by a smaller 4.9 magnitude aftershock. 

The geographical position of the Solomon Islands places them in ‘the ring of fire’, an area of tectonic activity in the basin of the Pacific Ocean that is subject to frequent earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.

"This is one of the most active seismic regions in the world -- in the last three years we have had 30 plus earthquakes of over 6.0 magnitude," Geoscience Australia Duty Seismologist Marco Maldoni told AFP.
