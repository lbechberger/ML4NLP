The Rice University baseball team (55-11) beat the University of Oklahoma (45-22) in the NCAA Super Regional 9-5. Rice won the series between the two schools 2-1 and will now play in the College World Series.

Rice rallied in the 6th inning and turned a 4-3 deficit into an 8-4 lead. Rodriguez put Rice up 5-4 with a bases-loaded single, then Joe Savery helped bring the score to 8-4 after a hit toward center field that was just right of the 400-foot sign.

Other schools that have already advanced to the College World Series are Cal State Fullerton, Oregon State, Clemson, and Georgia Tech. South Carolina and Georgia will play later today to determine which school advances to the College World Series.
