The West Gippsland Latrobe Football League members have voted to rename it the Gippsland Football League (GFL) from the 2010 season. The GFL is the only major Australian rules football league in the Gippsland region of Australia.

The league currently represents the Western, Central and Southern regions of Gippsland with Bairnsdale possibly joining from the East Gippsland Football League. Currently, Sale and Maffra are located furthest east of the GFL's clubs, Warragul furthest west and Wonthaggi furthest south.

At the same meeting, Wonthaggi Power was formally accepted into the competition. The club accepted the move after a dispute with the Victorian Country Football League over leaving the Alberton Football League.
