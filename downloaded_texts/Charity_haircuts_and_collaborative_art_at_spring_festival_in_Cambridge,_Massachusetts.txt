The 22nd annual Mayfair took place in Harvard Square in Cambridge, Massachusetts, on May 1. The event, which ran from 12-6 pm, featured work from local artists, performers, as well as a large cadre of tents selling beads, ceramics, and fried foods. After light rain in the early afternoon, the sun came out around 4 pm.

Local streets were closed to cars, and vendors and artists set up along the curbs. Church Street was blocked off and dedicated to chalk drawings, which were drawn by professional artists and amateurs alike. One of the largest drawings was a reproduction of Hokusai's "In The Hollow of a Wave off the Coast at Kanagawa," known colloquially as "The Wave."

The Alice Hoffman Breast Cancer Center and Locks of Love held a "charity shave," in which members of the public were encouraged to donate to the charity. Upon donating they would have their heads shaved, or at least 10" of their hair trimmed "in support of those who lose their hair to chemotherapy."

Several bands played in succession on a stage set up in front of the offices of Dewey, Cheetham, and Howe. Performers included Toussaint and the China Band, as well as The Walkmen.

Self-described "voice collector" Halsey Burgund brought his portable recording studio and successfully recorded samples from many passersby. At one point, his small box was packed with five youths who wanted to record a collaborative performance. Not everyone was interested in Burgund's box, though. "I don't want to give my name and some crap out," said one youth, pictured at right, who preferred not to give his name.
