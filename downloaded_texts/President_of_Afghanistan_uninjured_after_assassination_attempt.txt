At least one person was killed and nearly a dozen were injured after six Taliban militants opened fire during a celebration in an assassination attempt on the life of the president of Afghanistan, Hamid Karzai.

Karzai was taken away by body guards and was uninjured in the attack which happened in Kabul. Several other government diplomats and ministers were also present during the celebration and were uninjured. United States and British ambassadors were also present and uninjured.

"Today, the enemies of Afghanistan, the enemies of Afghanistan's security and progress tried to disrupt the ceremony and cause disorder and terror. Fortunately, Afghanistan's military forces surrounded them quickly and arrested some of the suspects," stated Karzai in a statement on national television less than two hours after the attack.

The people of Afghanistan were celebrating the 16th anniversary of the fall of the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan to the Mujahideen during a parade when the militants opened fire from a nearby building using guns and rocket propelled grenades.

At least three of the militants were killed, and the other three were arrested by police.
