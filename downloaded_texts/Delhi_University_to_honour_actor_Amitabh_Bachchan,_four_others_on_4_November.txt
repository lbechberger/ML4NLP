The Delhi University will award an honouris causa degree to its superstar alumnus Amitabh Bachchan on the 4 of November for his contribution to the Indian film industry. Notable cartoonist (and creator of the iconic Common Man character) R. K Laxman, Principal Scientific Adviser to the Prime Minister C N R Rao and Chief Minister of Delhi Sheila Dixit will also be presented with honorary degrees at the ceremony.

The University will also honour historian Romila Thapar, industrialist Ratan Tata (who recently negotiated the largest overseas takeover by an Indian company) and writer Mahashweta Devi at a separate convocation. 

Mr. Bachchan, who has acted in blockbusters such as Sholay and Don, was conferred an honorary doctorate by the De Montford University of Leicester in July. The French Government has also decided to present him with its highest civilian award- the Legion d'Honneur at an award ceremony which will be held at a later date.
