Riots in the town of Salt in Jordan have ended. The violence followed the shooting of a man at a police roadblock; 34 have been arrested over the riots, as has the policeman who pulled the trigger.

25-year-old Suleiman Khreisat was shot in the head on Wednesday and remains in critical condition; according to police, his car appeared suspicious, as it had no licence plates and broken windows. A police major gave chase after Khreisat allegedly failed to stop and shot him; he is now detained for use of excessive force against a civilian.

"Salt residents wanted to know who shot their townsman, demanding that police identify him so that they could take revenge," added Lieutenant Colonel Mohammed al-Khatib. Rioters attacked police kiosks, a traffic police building, and police cars. Stones were thrown at officers. Non-police targets included cash machines, streetlights, shop windows, cars and trees that were burned in two town squares. Roadblocks of burning tyres were formed.

"Several police officers and citizens were also wounded and have been hospitalized," according to al-Khatib, who added that tear gas was used to battle rioters. He says all 34 arrested will face trial.
