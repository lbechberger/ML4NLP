Firefighters in the Australian state of Victoria continue to battle blazes across rural Victoria which threaten up to 25 communities. Major fires of concern are near the Grampians National Park, La Trobe Valley and Gippsland.

The Grampians fire has destroyed 24 homes so far. Soaring temperatures and winds up to 50 km/h have fanned the Grampians blaze.
