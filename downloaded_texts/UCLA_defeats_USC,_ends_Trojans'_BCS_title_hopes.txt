Pasadena, CA

The UCLA Bruins defeated the USC Trojans in the final game of the regular season for both teams, 13-9. With the loss, USC drops to 10-2 and will most likely not play for the BCS National Championship of 2006. UCLA ends its season at 7-5 and will accept an invitation to the Emerald Bowl in San Francisco. It is projected that the Trojans will be invited to the Rose Bowl on New Year's Day.

With the loss, Ohio State University will likely play either Michigan or Florida in the BCS National Championship in Glendale, Arizona, on January 8th.
