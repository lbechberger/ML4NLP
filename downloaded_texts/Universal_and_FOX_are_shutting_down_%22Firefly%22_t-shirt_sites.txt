Universal Studios and Fox Broadcasting are sending cease-and-desist letters to websites that offer t-shirts related to the television program Firefly and its sequel film Serenity.

One cease and desist letter, for example, reads:


Affected by the cease-and-desist letters is CaféPress, a website which enables people to open their own store — they have since stopped allowing people to search for Firefly merchandise.

Firefly premiered and was cancelled in 2002 after 11 episodes aired. Many fans who watched and enjoyed the short-lived show were part of a cult following that encouraged Joss Whedon to create a film called "Serenity" in 2005. There are no current plans for a sequel or the revival of the Firefly series.
