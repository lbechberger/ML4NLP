African Union monitors in the Darfur region of Sudan have witnessed an air attack that has killed around 100 people.

The Sudanese government carried out the attack on a village in the northern part of Darfur. It represents a major violation of the ceasefire signed last April between the government and the rebels.

The rebels began their war with the government in 2003, accusing the government of neglecting their region and of oppressing black Africans in favour of Arab Africans.
