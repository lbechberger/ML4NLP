Fourteen million phone chargers have been recalled by Nokia amid fears that they could cause electric shocks. Despite the recall there have been no reported injuries. 

Chargers from the AC – 3E, AC – 3U and AC – 4U are the models in question. The models affected were made between June and October 2009. The chargers, made by the Chinese firm BYD, are mainly sold in Europe and North America. BYD has stated that it will pick up the costs of the replacements. 

An investigation by Nokia revealed that the charger covers became prone to coming off and revealing the components, increasing the risk of electric shocks. Customers can determine whether their charger is faulty on the Nokia website. Nokia has released a statement saying the recall is a “proactive, precautionary measure”.
