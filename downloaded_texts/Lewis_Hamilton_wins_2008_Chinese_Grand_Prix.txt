Vodafone McLaren Mercedes driver Lewis Hamilton has won the FIA Formula One 2008 Sinopec Chinese Grand Prix at the Shanghai International Circuit, Shanghai, China. 

Starting from pole position Lewis stayed in full control of the race with a substantial gap ahead of his Ferrari counterparts. As Felipe Massa stayed after Kimi Räikkönen for most of the time losing hopes for his title prospect, he pushed on Kimi on the dying laps of the race and slipstreamed him 7 laps to go.

Fernando Alonso once again showed good form for Renault finishing fourth, same place as on the starting grid, ahead of both BMW Sauber's of Nick Heidfeld and Robert Kubica who started 7th and 12th.

Hamilton's teammate Heikki Kovalainen passed Alonso on the starting lap, but Alonso counterattacked and returned his 4th place not to lose it to the end of the race. Later Kovalainen tore his front tyre, changed it and retired to McLaren pits later on.

Timo Glock came seventh for Toyota starting behind Kubica. He replaced his teammate Jarno Trulli in the top eight as Jarno was taken out by STR-Ferrari of Sébastien Bourdais in the first corner on the first lap.

Alonso's younger teammate Nelson Piquet Jr. closed the top eight scoring one last point.

In the sight of the final round in Brazil Lewis Hamilton now has a perfect chances to win the championship with 94 points, 7 points ahead of Felipe Massa. Robert Kubica didn't performed well this weekend and lose all mathematical chances to win as well as the other drivers in the standings more than 10 points after Lewis. The 2-3 podium double allowed Ferrari to lead the Constructors' standings with 156 points, 11 points ahead of McLaren and 21 ahead of BMW.
