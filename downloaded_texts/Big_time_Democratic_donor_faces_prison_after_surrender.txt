Norman Hsu, democratic fundraiser, has turned himself in to San Mateo County sheriff's deputies in Redwood City, California. "We arranged for Mr. Hsu to turn himself in to the court," said Hsu's San Francisco attorney. "He's very anxious to get this behind him."

Hsu was living a wealthy life in New York City up till this week when local newspapers began examining purported abuses in campaign financing. Over the past few years Hsu has given an estimated US$600,000 to various democratic candidates.
