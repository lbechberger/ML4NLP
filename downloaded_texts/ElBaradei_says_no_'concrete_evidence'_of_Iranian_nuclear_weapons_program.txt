Mohamed ElBaradei, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, said on Sunday that he had seen no "concrete evidence" that Iran is developing nuclear weapons.

ElBaradei discussed Iran's nuclear program in an interview with CNN's Wolf Blitzer on Sunday. When asked "Do you believe there is a clandestine, secret nuclear weapons program right now under way in Iran?" ElBaradei said "We haven't seen any concrete evidence to that effect... We suspect that Iran might have the intention, but I don't think I have seen anybody saying Iran today is working actively on a weapon program. And if there are such information, I would be very happy to receive it."

Tensions between the United States and Iran have been on the rise recently, with U.S. President George W. Bush warning of the potential for "World War III" should Iran develop a nuclear weapon. On Thursday, the United States imposed new sanctions on Iran in an effort to pressure it to stop enriching uranium.

ElBaradei recommended entering negotiations with Iran as soon as possible to resolve the conflict. "The earlier we go into negotiation, the earlier we follow the North Korean model, the better for everybody," he said.
