Hotshot batsman Brian Lara has become the second player in test cricket history to score 11,000 runs. Brian achieved the milestone while delivering a characteristic century to his West Indies team score sheet during day one of the final Test against Australia in Adelaide. Lara scored an unbeaten 106 by tea and cucumber sandwich time and is now only 107 runs behind Test record holder Allan Border, who plundered and pillaged 11,174 runs in 265 innings.

Lara already holds the records for the highest Test and first-class scores, 400 not out and 501 respectively.
