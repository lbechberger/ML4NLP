Australia has won the first test of The Ashes series against England by 239 runs at Lords in London. 

Rain threatened to halt the Australia's charge towards victory on Day Four but it held off long enough for Glenn McGrath and Shane Warne to together pick up the five required wickets for victory. 

Earlier, Australia's 9th and 10th wicket partnerships put on 95 runs between them, leaving England with the unlikely chase of 420 runs. 

McGrath bowled superbly in the test and finished with match figures of 9-82. The 35 year-old claimed his 500th test wicket in the first innings, placing him fourth on the all-time list. For the home team, debutant Kevin Pieterson scored 57 and 64 not out to ensure England were not thrashed.

Scores: Australia 190 and 384, England 155 and 180
