Bill Prozena has left his position as director of the National Hurricane Center in the United States after about half of the center's employees called for his removal. He has been re-assigned within the center and will be replaced by deputy director Ed Rappaport.

National Hurricane Center spokesman Dennis Feltgen said, "We need to move forward. Effective immediately Ed Rappaport will serve as acting director on an interim basis."
