A boxer is missing in Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania, after it chased off a bear to protect three children. According to Bill Rusko, the father of two of the children, the bear crossed Route 30 in Ligonier Township and moved towards the three kids as they played badminton. The year-old dog, Major, then ran around the bear to distract it and bit it in the face. As the bear ran back into the woods, the dog chased it. It remains missing; however, neighbors say they saw it in the area. Major is now safe at his home.
