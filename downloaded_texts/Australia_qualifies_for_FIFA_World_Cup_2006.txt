Australia's national soccer team, the Socceroos, have qualified for the 2006 Soccer World Cup in Germany, after beating Uruguay in a penalty shoot out in front of 80 000 spectators at Stadium Australia. This is the first time that Australia has qualified in 32 years and the second time in the history of the FIFA Football World Cup. The Australian team is managed by the Dutchman Guus Hiddink, who led South Korea to the semi finals of the 2002 Soccer World Cup and is also currently coaching PSV Eindhoven, a Dutch football club.

Australia lost the first qualifier to Uruguay 1-0 in Montevideo and needed to win by 2 goals in order to guarantee qualification. A goal by Marco Bresciano in the first half had Australia leading 1-0 at the end of regular and extra time - leading to a penalty shoot-out. Goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer saved the first Uruguayan penalty attempt and Australia made their first three shots count. However Mark Viduka shot wide and the game was again open. Australia's chance was again alive as Schwarzer saved the next shot. The subsequent shot sealed the win for the Socceroos.
