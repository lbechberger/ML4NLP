United States President George W. Bush received an unwelcome gift from an overhead-flying sparrow, which deposited a fresh batch of its feces on the left sleeve of Bush's suit. 

Bush was addressing the American press on Thursday in a nationally televised broadcast outside the White House in the Rose Garden. The incident occurred just as Bush said, "I've got confidence in Al Gonzales doin' the job," referring to a question asked by a reporter about the controversial dismissal of several U.S. attorneys. Bush then tried to remove the offending material several times with his hand. 

Deputy Press Secretary Dana Perino said the 'poo-drop' signified good luck saying, "It was his lucky day...everyone knows that's a sign of good luck." On the whole the media coverage of the incident has been lighthearted and humorous.
