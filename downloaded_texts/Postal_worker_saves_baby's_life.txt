A postal worker saved a baby's life after the baby fell from a two-story apartment window in Albany, New York. Lisa Harrell was delivering a package when she saw the 1-year-old fall. She caught the baby.

The baby was sitting on a bed when her mother walked out of the room for a moment; the baby then crawled out the open window. The mother will not be charged.

According to paramedics, the baby was not injured when falling from the second story of the building.

"I just feel like, you know thank God I was at the right place, at the right time," said Lisa. "I started crying. I just said thank God I caught this baby. I was delivering an express piece of mail. I had deviated from my route," she said.
