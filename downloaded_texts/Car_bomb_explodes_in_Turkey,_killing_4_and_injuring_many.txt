A car bomb has exploded in Diyarbakir, a city in the southeastern part of Turkey. According to the prime minister of Turkey, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, at least 4 people have died in the attack and 52 others have been injured.

The bombing, which took place in the city center, approximately 100 yards from a military post, was apparently targeting a passing military vehicle. Many Turkish troops currently fighting rebels from the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) are based in the city, which also has a large Kurdish population.

The prime minister blamed the attack on terrorists in a nationally televised speech, while other authorities placed the blame on Kurdish rebels. Two suspects have been apprehended by police.

"Such events will not disrupt our determination against terrorism. Our struggle both on international and national levels will continue with the same determination." Recep Tayyip Erdogan said.

The explosion occurred at 4:55 p.m. local time, and could be heard up to two miles away. Several cars were engulfed in flames and windows shattered from the force of the blast.

Two of the dead were reportedly soldiers. Among the injured were students attending a nearby private school at the time of the explosion.
