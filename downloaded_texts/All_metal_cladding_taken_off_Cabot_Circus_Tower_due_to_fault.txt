All metal cladding has been forced to be taken off the primary tower at Cabot Circus, Bristol, United Kingdom, due to a fault. 

This move comes only five months before the shopping centre is due to open.

A representative for Cabot Circus did, however, say that the move has not "compromised the overall budget."

The shopping centre is intended to be home to 120 new shops.
