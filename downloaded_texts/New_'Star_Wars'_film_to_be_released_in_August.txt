George Lucas has announced that there will be one last Star Wars movie to end the saga, but it won't have any actors visible.

Star Wars: The Clone Wars, an animated film is scheduled to be released into theaters on August 15 of this year.

"I felt there were a lot more 'Star Wars' stories left to tell. I was eager to start telling some of them through animation and, at the same time, push the art of animation forward," said Lucas in a statement to the media.

Lucas says that although the film is animated, people can expect the same kind of galactic space battles and action that all the other Star Wars films have. The approximate running time of the film is 100 minutes.

The film is produced by Warner Brothers and Lucasfilm LTD. The new movie is also set to continue as an animated, 30 minute "mini-movie" series this autumn. The show can be seen on the Cartoon Network.
