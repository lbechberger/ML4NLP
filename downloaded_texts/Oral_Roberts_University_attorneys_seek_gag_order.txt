Attorneys for Oral Roberts University requested a gag order on court filings related to alleged illegal political and financial wrongdoing as well as wrongful firings. According to a court filing, ORU believes "their legal motion that publicity allegedly manipulated by the professors and their attorneys could lower the possibility of a fair trial. They want the professors and their attorneys barred from talking about the case outside of court." Specifically, "The motion refers to a report allegedly compiled by Roberts' sister-in-law, Stephanie Cantees, that Roberts has said consists of false rumors."

Also on Friday, the ORU Regents hired the Washington, D.C. law firm of Miller &amp; Chevalier Chartered to investigate ORU expenses and the Arlington, Texas accounting firm Pickens Snodgrass Koch &amp; Company will support the investigation. 

The controversy has forced ORU president Richard Roberts to step down as his father Oral Roberts returns to the school. ORU Board of Regents Chairman George Pearsons said the change was temporary and did not imply guilt.
