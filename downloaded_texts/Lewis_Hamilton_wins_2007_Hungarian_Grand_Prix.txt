McLaren Mercedes driver Lewis Hamilton wins the FIA Formula-1 2007 Hungarian Grand Prix at the Hungaroring, Budapest, Hungary.

After the pole-position of his teammate Fernando Alonso was discarded to 6th place by the stewards overnight for a non-sporting behaviour of Alonso's unusual 20 seconds delay on his last pit stop, Hamilton became the leader on the starting grid. Also, McLaren faced another penalty of not scoring any points in the Constructors' Championship, which will be appealed later, team spokesman says.

Leading from start to finish, Hamilton was under heavy pressure from Kimi Räikkönen from Ferrari. The Finn was able to come very close to McLaren rooky, but not to overtake him finishing second.

BMW Sauber driver Nick Heidfeld started second from the dirty side of the track allowing Kimi to pass him easily enough. German driver made a clear race upon the near finish where he was under heavy pressure from Alonso, but remained in his third place while Alonso himself jumped to the fourth from the 6th starting place. This became the second podium finish for Nick on Hungarian Grand Prix since 2006.

Unlucky race for Felipe Massa, Kimi's teammate, who suffered a problems earlier in qualification not fully able to compete in the race also (13th place).

Second BMW driver, Poland Robert Kubica finished fifth ahead of Ralf Schumacher from Toyota, Nico Rosberg from Williams-Toyota and Heikki Kovalainen from Renault teams with Heikki closing top eight.
