Actor Nicolas Cage was seen around various Washington, D.C.-area monuments this week by Wikinews contributor Patrick Mannion, filming the sequel to 2004's National Treasure. He was seen on March 28 outside on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, sitting in his chair talking with a director. Cage has also been seen in the company of costars from the earlier film. The Memorial was closed to the public by police and park rangers while filming took place.

The sequel to the 2004 film, entitled National Treasure 2: Book of Secrets, is currently filming through April 16. In addition to the Lincoln Memorial, crews were also spotted along the Capitol's small Reflecting Pool, outside the White House, and in Layfette Square.

The District of Columbia hopes to see a large economic return on the film by granting the long-term filming rights and a financial incentive to keep filming in Washington on-location, instead of doing principal photography and then moving to another city where production costs are cheaper.
