On April 30th the South Pacific island nation of Niue held its eleventh general election since achieving self-government from New Zealand in 1974. Approximately 800 voters were eligible to vote for the 20 members of the Niue Assembly â€“ 90% of the island's citizens now live in New Zealand and were ineligible to vote.

Niue News reports that there was no campaigning. Provisional results indicate that Finance Minister Toke Talagi lost his seat by two votes, in the contest for the six common roll seats elected for the whole island, meanwhile former minister Robert Rex, Jr, came third in the poll for the village seat of Alofi South. Three of the twenty seats are expected to be won by women. Premier Young Vivian is expected to retain his position.
