U.S. Senator John McCain will next observe the effects of global warming on Greenland. The Danish government has invited a number of influential American politicians to visit for them to witness with their own eyes the consequences of climate change on the Arctic ice.

Last year 25 Environmental Ministers from all over the world were treated to a similar tour. Last week American scientists from University of Texas at Austin released a study that showed that the ice is melting three times faster now than in the late nineties.

Among several senators participating in the trip is former presidential candidate John McCain. From the Danish side, Foreign Minister Per Stig MÃ¸ller and Minister for the Environment Connie Hedegaard will be on the tour.

"We have to realize, that the current president hasn't in mind to do anything, but John McCain can be key to that process in the U.S." Connie Hedegaard said to DR's radio news.
