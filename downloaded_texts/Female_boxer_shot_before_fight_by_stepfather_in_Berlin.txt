A female boxer has been shot by her stepfather in her dressing room before a world championship title fight in Berlin, Germany. Lebanese born Rola El-Halabi was shot in the hands, knees, and feet while she was preparing for the fight. She survived the shooting but may never be able to return to the ring. Two security guards were also injured in the attack.

El-Halabi has spoke about the shooting to German media saying "I was with my coach and manager in the changing room when Dad rushed into the room, threatening us with a gun and shouted 'All Out!'. Then he shot me in the hand from three feet away, I cried and cried, begging him to put the gun away. He threatened to shoot himself, but he was too cowardly. He took his time aiming and and shot me in the knee, then in my right foot."

Malte Mueller-Michaelis, her promoter, commented on her condition saying "Her operation went smoothly, but the shots were intended to end her career and it seems almost certain that that will happen." It is believed that the shooting was due to El-Halabi's decision to stop working with her stepfather as her manager. 

The 26 year-old had been due to fight Irma Adler of Bosnia for the WIBF world lightweight title. El-Halabi has an undefeated record with 11 wins and is the former holder of two world titles.
