Sony's PlayStation 3 Entertainment System has been banned in British prisons. One of its key features is built in Wi-Fi which has the ability to send radio signals. To prevent prisoners from sending messages about jail breaks and other possible violations, it has been banned.

"The Sony PlayStation 3 was barred from the prison estate because of the equipment's ability to send and receive radio signals," said British Home Secretary John Reid.

The PlayStation 3 was launched in the United Kingdom last month. A similar ban was put in for Sony's PlayStation 2 which was alleged that inmates could use it to look at pornography.
