England's woman football team made a dramatic start to their Euro 2005 campaign when a 92nd minute strike gave them victory over Finland in the City of Manchester stadium.

Twenty-nine thousand fans saw seventeen year-old Karen Carney kick the winning goal with a 15-yard shot over the keeper into the roof of the net.

England gained an early lead after a header by Amanda Barr put them ahead and an own-goal from Finland gave them a 2-0 lead at half-time.

But a revitalised Finland scored soon after the interval when Anna-Kaisa Rantanen found the back of the net, and England where under constant pressure from then on. England looked set to hold on for a victory to put them at the top of Group A until the last minute of normal time saw Laura Kalmari score, leaving the match at 2-2.

The England strike team found new vigour with Carney and her fellow forwards putting the Finns under heavy pressure, with Carney eventually defeating the Finnish keeper who had made several dramatic saves in the last ten minutes of play.

England now face Denmark on Wednesday. Denmark are expected to be a tougher opposition than Finland.

In the other Group A match, Sweden drew with Denmark, each earning one point, leaving England clear at the top of the table with three points for Sunday evening's victory.
