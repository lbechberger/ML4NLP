A man has been arrested in connection with the murders of a mother and her three children. The thirty-six year-old was arrested at Heathrow Airport this morning. He was leaving an incoming flight from Bangkok, Thailand.

It is believed that the man arrested is Rahan Arshad, the husband and father of the victims. He is expected to be taken to Manchester, England for questioning later today.

The bodies of thirty-two year-old Uzma Rahan and her three children were found in their home in Cheadle Hulme in Greater Manchester on August 20. Police think the four bodies had been there for up to four weeks.

Police say they were aware that Mr. Rahan had left the country on a Thailand-bound flight about four weeks ago. After the bodies were discovered, officers wanted to trace the whereabouts of Mr. Rahan immediately.

Mrs. Rahan, eleven year-old Adam, eight year-old Abbas and six year-old Henne were found to have serious head injuries, and post-mortem tests concluded that they were beaten to death. 

Three days after the bodies were discovered, a thirty-five year-old woman and a forty year-old man were arrested in connection with the deaths, but they were later released on police bail.
