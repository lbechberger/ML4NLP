A sexual attack on a woman in her Pukekohe, South Auckland home was, police say, premeditated.

A man, who had been drinking, told the victim that he needed to use her phone, she handed him a portable phone through a small opening in the door and then closed the door. The man pretended to use the phone and then when she opened the door again to regain her phone the man barged his way in, at about 9:00 p.m., Tuesday, June 13 NZST.

It was a five-hour attack and she only managed to escape when, the next day, she was driven to an ATM to withdraw money where she fumbled with her bank cards and while the attacker was distracted she ran to a service station.

The victim told police that she believed that the man had been stalking her for about a week. Criminal profilers are worried that he may strike again.

Detective Senior Sergeant Grimstone says "the terror in the woman's eyes is clearly visible as she asks for help at a service station."

The attacker could be wearing blue jeans and a black jacket that was taken from the victim's house. The attacker is described as an unshaven MÄ�ori male in his late 30s or 40s.
