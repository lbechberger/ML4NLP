Red Bull drivers Sebastian Vettel and Mark Webber made a one-two finish from the front line of the starting grid of the Formula One 2010 Japanese Grand Prix at Suzuka Circuit, Japan.

Lewis Hamilton crashed early in a free practice damaging his suspension, but was able to participate in a qualifying session using a spare car. Though Hamilton posted the third fastest time, he lost 5 places on the starting grid for a gearbox change.

After Robert Kubica lost a rear wheel from his Renault car and retired from the race, it was Fernando Alonso who owned the third place on the podium for Ferrari, to follow his floodlit win at Singapore

Jenson Button (McLaren) passed his teammate Hamilton after the latter lost his third gear. They finished fourth and fifth.

Nico Rosberg lost his rear wheel and retired just as Kubica did earlier. His teammate Michael Schumacher came sixth for Mercedes factory team.

Two Saubers of Kamui Kobayashi and Nick Heidfeld, a Williams of Rubens Barrichello and a Toro Rosso of Sebastien Buemi closed the top ten drivers in the finishing lap with the leader.

The situation in the season standings tightens as both Alonso and Vettel are now 14 points behind Mark Webber, and the two McLaren drivers are following on their heels. Constructor championship standings are more clearly owned by Red Bull, as McLaren is 45 points behind and Ferrari is 92 points behind.
