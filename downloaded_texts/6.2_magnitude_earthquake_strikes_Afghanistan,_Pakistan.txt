An earthquake with a magnitude of 6.2 struck the Hindu Kush mountains of Afghanistan along the border with Pakistan early on Friday, the US Geological Survey reported.


The tremors, which started at 00.21 local time (19.51 UTC), were felt in the capitals of both countries. There were no immediate reports of deaths or destruction from the earthquakes.

A reporter for the Al Jazeera news agency said that the initial earthquake lasted for several seconds, and was followed by a heavy aftershock.

In October 2005, a heavy 7.6 magnitude earthquake struck northwestern Pakistan, displacing over three million people and killing almost 75,000. A 6.9 magnitude tremor in 1998 killed over 50,000 and caused flooding and mudslides.
