The Beatles' song Hey Jude became the best-selling song of the band on iTunes, since their songs became available there earlier this week.

Hey Jude was released as single by the band on August 26, 1968, and was composed and written by John Lennon and Paul McCartney. It reached number one in both the UK Singles Chart (September 11–18, 1968) and the US' Billboard Hot 100 (September 28–November 23, 1968). Hey Jude was also the number-one single of the year in the United States.

According to The Daily Record, Hey Jude is followed by Twist and Shout, Let It Be and Strawberry Fields Forever in popularity, although none of the songs have reached the Top 40.

The Beatles' songs had not been available previously on iTunes due to a copyright dispute with Apple Inc.
