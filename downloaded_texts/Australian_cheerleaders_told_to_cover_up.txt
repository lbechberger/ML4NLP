Australian cheerleaders have been told today to cover up their midriffs under calls by Gymnastics Australia, as they believe it encourages girls to be self-conscious.

Nerine Cooper, head of Gymnastics Australia, told the Sunday Telegraph, "We don't want girls to feel under pressure to lose weight because of uniforms." 

Lisa Ince, head of Sydney Professional Dancers, disagreed. "It's ridiculous really, if the thinking is that a midriff is offensive, then every dance school and athletics club would face the same restrictions," she said.

The ban will affect about 150 teams registered with Gymnastics Australia.
