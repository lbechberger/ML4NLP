Eleven days, or 266 hours after an earthquake in Sichuan Province in China which killed over 60,000 people, a survivor has been rescued from the rubble of his own house in the city of Mianzhu.

 
Xiao Zhihu, 80, who is said to be in stable condition at a local hospital, was paralyzed prior to the earthquake and was found underneath a pillar that once held up his house. Officials said that the only reason he survived so long was because he was being fed by his wife.

At least 30,000 people are missing as a result of the magnitude 7.9 quake on May 12. Officials fear the death toll could go above 80,000. The quake's epicenter was located in the Aba prefecture, 90 kilometers (55 miles) west, northwest of Chengdu, Sichuan, China and was recorded at a depth of 10 k.m. (6.2 miles).

This was the largest earthquake to strike the region in almost 60 years. The deadliest quake in China's history was of magnitude 7.8, striking Tangshan in 1976. Approximately 250,000 people were killed. On May 23, a man who survived that quake after being buried for 10 days, was found alive in the rubble of an office building in Beichuan. He was the only survivor.
