On Monday, November 27, 2006 the Medical Health Officers of the Vancouver Coastal Health and Fraser Health recommended that the boil water advisory that had been in effect for the City of Vancouver, North Vancouver, and Burnaby could now be lifted. Hospitals, care facilities, schools, food premises and the public are no longer being advised to boil drinking water or to use an alternate drinking water source. The boil water advisory for the Greater Vancouver Regional District (GVRD) had been lifted days before but had remained in effect for the listed areas. 

Turbidity is on a downward trend but still remains above pre-storm levels. Water may continue to appear cloudy or discoloured for some time. The Medical Health Officers, monitoring and testing the water, at no point found the water un-safe, but felt the boil water advisory was justified as a safety precauction. It has been advised that people with comprised immune systems should continue to boil drinking water or drink filtered water.
