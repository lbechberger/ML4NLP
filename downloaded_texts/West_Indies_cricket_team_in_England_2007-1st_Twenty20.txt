West Indies have beaten England by 15 runs in the first Twenty20 international of their tour of England at The Oval, London, England.

The West Indian innings started off badly by losing Gayle early, however they turned their fortunes around with some attacking and aggressive cricket and posted a huge total of 208. A bigger total could have been posted if it had not been for a late innings batting collapse. England started their reply by getting off to a flyer, but lost some early wickets that slowed down the run-rate. Leading the charge was Paul Collingwood with a fast 79 with 5 4's and 4 6's. In the end, England fell short by 15 runs. Had they not have lost the early wickets, England would have probably won the match to take a 1-0 lead in the series. Instead, it is West Indies that have taken a 1-0 lead in the series.

Toss: West Indies won, and chose to bat first.
