Canucks lead series 2-1. (Best of Seven)



An overtime goal by Taylor Pyatt at 7:47 of the first overtime gave the Vancouver Canucks a 2-1 lead in the best of seven series on Sunday night. 

Dallas scored first through Stu Barnes when he redirected a long shot by Stephane Robidas past goalkeeper Roberto Luongo. Philippe Boucher earned the other assist on the goal. 

Marty Turco looked to be headed for his second consecutive playoff shutout, but Jan Bulis dashed his dreams 5:18 into the third period as he put home a rebound from a shot by Jannik Hansen. Vancouver outshot the Stars 15-4 in the third period, but had a scare when Roberto Luongo was hit by Ladislav Nagy. A trainer came on to assist Luongo, who had fallen on his back, but he was able to continue.

Taylor Pyatt then put the game away in overtime on a one-time shot off a pass from Bryan Smolinski.
