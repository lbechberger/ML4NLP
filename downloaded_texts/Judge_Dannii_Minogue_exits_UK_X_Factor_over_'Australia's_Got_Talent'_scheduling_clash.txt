Australian singer Dannii Minogue has made the decision to depart from the judging panel of The X Factor, a televised singing competition in the United Kingdom. In a statement, she said: "I am so disappointed that I can't be a part of The X Factor this year. I'm going to miss the show and the amazing team who work so incredibly hard on it."

Since her first appearance on The X Factor in 2007, Minogue has gone on to mentor two series-winning acts, Leon Jackson and Matt Cardle. When attributing the reason for her departure, which occurred a short time period before the launch of the eighth series of the competition, Minogue stated, "[d]uring discussions for me to return [to The X Factor] it became clear that unfortunately, this year, the X Factor audition dates in the UK clash with the live shows of Australia's Got Talent [on which she is a judge] during June and July. For this reason I am unable to return."

According to Metro.co.uk, British musician Tulisa Contostavlos from English group N-Dubz will be employed in the position Minogue was on The X Factor. Various users of social networking website Twitter reacted negatively to this news, the Metro reported.

One source close to the programme told Sky News that Contostavlos is "not a reality TV creation, she's created herself" and that "[e]veryone on the show has met her, and they loved her. She's the real deal." He also reported that "[t]he singer from north London also fits 'the right age demographic'".
