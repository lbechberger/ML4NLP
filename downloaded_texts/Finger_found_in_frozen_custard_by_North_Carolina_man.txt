In an eerie echo of the Wendy's chili finger case, a man found a severed finger tip in his frozen custard on Monday in North Carolina, USA. However, unlike the Wendy's case, agriculture and labor officials have confirmed with Craig Thomas, the owner of Kohl's Frozen Custard, that an employee had lost the finger tip while working with the custard dispensing machine at the location.

"I thought it was candy because they put candy in your ice cream ... to make it a treat," Clarence Stowers told Wilmington WWAY TV. Stowers continued, "OK, well, I'll just put it in my mouth and get the ice cream off of it and see what it is."

The Kohl's Frozen Custard outlet is located on South College Road in Wilmington, North Carolina.

"We are still trying to ascertain what exactly happened," owner Thomas told WRAL Raleigh-Durham. "But in the seconds that it took for the accident to happen, and for (the employee) to tell the manager that it happened, a pint was being scooped out," he said.

"I'm sick at my stomach, I just can't get that taste out of my mouth," Stowers told WECT TV6 in Wilmington. Stowers is keeping the finger tip in his freezer and said he plans to hire a lawyer.

This is the second time that an employee has lost a finger tip at Kohl's Frozen Custard. Former employee William Franklin lost a finger tip last summer, but an investigation by the Department of Labor placed the blame on Franklin for that incident.

Kohl's Frozen Custard was permitted to re-open after state inspectors monitored the disassembly and sterilization of the custard dispensing machine.
