London, England — South Korea earned a 4–3 goalball victory against Algeria earlier today in the fifth match of the day at London's Copper Box.

South Korean Sung-Wook Hong was the game's leading scorer with 4 goals. He is a B2 classified blind competitor, though classification is largely irrelevant in goalball as all classified blind players wear masks to provide even levels of sight in the game.

The B2 classified Algerian Mohamed Mokrane led his team in scoring, with two points. From Chlef, he captains a side that qualified by winning the 2011 Africa Oceania Regional Championships in Sydney, Australia. His team comes into the Games having finished sixth at last year's World Championships.

In a previous match today, Iran defeated China by a score of 9–5 after having been ahead 4–2 at the half.
