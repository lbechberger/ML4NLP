Sony BMG has announced it will suspend production of CDs with their controversial "anti-piracy" software. The move follows litigation being brought against the company for the software which allegedly opens up Microsoft Windows to malicious attacks.

In an ironic turn of events, it now appears that Sony's software violates the copyright of the popular LAME mp3 player, which is distributed under a public license. In the past, German courts have forced companies to release their source code to the public when it was based upon software distributed under such a license.
