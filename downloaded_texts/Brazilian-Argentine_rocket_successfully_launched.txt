After its start had been postponed four times due to bad weather conditions, a research rocket of type "VS-30" took off successfully on Sunday, 16 December from Brazil. During the mission, which lasted nine minutes and 25 seconds, the rocket reached a height of 150 kilometers according to Xinhua, but only 120 km according to Associated Press.

The joint project between Brazil and Argentina was in accordance with a contract from 1998, under which both states contributed with experiments that were transported into space as a workload. The rocket was launched at 9:15 am CET from the spaceport located in Boca do Inferno in the Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Norte. 122 kilometers from the launch site, the workload landed in the Atlantic Ocean. After its recovery, the evaluation of the experiments will take place in Buenos Aires.
