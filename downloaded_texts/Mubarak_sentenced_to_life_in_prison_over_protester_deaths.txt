Former Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak has been sentenced to life imprisonment by a court in Egypt for his responsibility as leader in the murders of protesters during the last year's Egyptian revolution.

Mubarak resigned from his presidential position in February 2011 as a result of the widespread protests. He has been hospitalized in Egypt's International Medical Center since the start of his trial due to bad health; and is the first Arab world leader, since the Arab Spring began over a year ago, prosecuted while in custody.

Habib el-Adly, who was Mubarak's interior minister, was also given life for the same type of offense. Four highly-placed government workers from the interior ministry in charge of security — including former Deputy Interior Minister Hassan Abd El Rahman — and two regional security directors were cleared of any wrongdoing. The former president's sons Alaa and Gamal Mubarak were found not guilty on corruption charges.

People in Egypt both celebrated the convictions and protested the acquittals. Protests occurred throughout the country in Cairo's Tahrir Square, Suez, and Mansoura.

While Mubarak was transferred to the Tora prison hospital, independent lawyers said they expect an appeal, which would extend the trial. The trial has already gone on for ten months before the verdict.
