Earlier today in front of the office of Italy's prime minister in Rome, shots were fired. According to Reuters, a witness reported around eight shots fired. This happened the same day the new Italian government is being sworn in.

Reuters is also reporting at least two policemen were shot. Reportedly the gunman has been arrested.

The process of selecting a new government took two months, with Democratic Party member Enrico Letta becoming the Prime Minister today. The Democratic Party joined with former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's People of Freedom Party to form a coalition government. Letta was at the Quirinal Palace, less than a kilometer away, at the time of the shooting for his inauguration.
