On Friday, Luis Aragones, coach of the Spanish national football team, announced the preliminary squad for the World Cup finals in Germany. The pick was criticised by Getafe coach Bernd Schuster.

The 27-man squad includes 7 players from the Premier League, among them Chelsea left-back Asier Del Horno. Schuster claims that Getafe full-back Mariano Pernia should have been picked instead. "All Del Horno has done this year is kick Barcelona's Lionel Messi in the Champions League," says Schuster, referring to Horno's red card in the Champions League game between Chelsea and Barcelona back in February.

Pernia, who was born in Argentina, has dual citizenship, and could play for Spain in the World Cup finals. According to Schuster, Pernia had a successful season in La Liga, scoring ten goals.

Aragones must announce his 23-man squad by May 15.
