Eighteen-year-old Joseph Randay and Dilsher Singh Gill, seventeen, were kidnapped Thursday evening and found dead Friday morning on Lower Sumas Mountain Road near Abbotsford, British Columbia.

"All we know is that they were kidnapped at gunpoint and now they have found their bodies. The police said they are both dead...police have no leads," said Amarjit Randay, father of the one of the slain teenagers.

"We're going through all our steps to try and get to the bottom of it," Cpl. Dale Carr of the Integrated Homicide Investigation Unit said, "I can tell you it is certainly perplexing how two young men — just weeks away from graduation — ended up in this fate. It's a very tragic case.

Police believe the teens were kidnapped at gun point from the Bateman Park in Abbotsford following an altercation.

The Vancouver Sun reported that Randay had communicated via Facebook networking with Mike Ahuja. Sunny Ahuja is associated with the Bacon brothers, alleged gang members. In March, there had been a drive-by shooting associated with the Ahuja home. 

The two teens were grade twelve students who attended W. J. Mouat Secondary School in Abbotsford, B.C. 

"We're adding more police officers to investigate, arrest and get violent criminals off the street, and we're dedicating more prosecutors to put criminals behind bars," said Premier Gordon Campbell. Over the next ten years, BC will deploy 168 more officers and ten prosecutors to combat gun crime, gangs and related violence. In April of 2009, over 150 arrests were conducted of alleged Hells Angels members and associates.

Abbotsford, population 123,864, is reported as being the "theft capital of Canada." Its close proximity to the Canada – United States border facilitates the trading of marijuana with cocaine according to the Central Chronicle. Gang shootings have cost the lives of 110 Canadian youth of Indian origin over the past fourteen years, many of whom have been involved in drug gangs.
