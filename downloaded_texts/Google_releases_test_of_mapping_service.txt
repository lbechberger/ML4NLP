Google Inc. on Tuesday rolled out a test version of its mapping service â€” a type of service long offered by its rivals Yahoo and Microsoft. The web site, http://maps.google.com, is designed to let users display maps of locations around the United States and Canada, find businesses near those locations, and generate driving directions between locations.

Unlike the competitors' offerings, Google's mapping system shows bigger maps and does not require a reload of the web page when a user pans or zooms the map. The site uses the Google Local search to incorporate local businesses onto the map. Google uses mapping data from TeleAtlas and Navteq, according to information shown on the mapping site.
