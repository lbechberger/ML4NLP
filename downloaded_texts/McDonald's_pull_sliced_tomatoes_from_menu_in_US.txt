McDonald's Corp. has temporarily pulled tomatoes from its sandwiches in the United States. They stated a precautionary move in the wake of a salmonella outbreak. At least 145 people in around 16 states have been infected with the bacteria known as Salmonella Saintpaul. The sandwiches affected are the premium chicken sandwiches and the Big N' Tasty burger. 

Raw cherry tomatoes and grape tomatoes don't present a problem, the FDA says. McDonald's said it will continue to serve grape tomatoes in its premium salads.
