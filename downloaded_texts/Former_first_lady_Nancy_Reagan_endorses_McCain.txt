Former First Lady Nancy Reagan, widow of the late President Ronald Reagan, endorsed Senator John McCain for the Presidency of the United States on Tuesday at her home in Bel Air, Los Angeles, California.

The 86-year-old former First Lady issued a statement which read, "John McCain has been a good friend for over thirty years. My husband and I first came to know him as a returning Vietnam War POW, and were impressed by the courage he had shown through his terrible ordeal. I believe Johnâ€™s record and experience have prepared him well to be our next president."

Senator McCain said of the endorsement, "This is an important, most important kind of expression of confidence in my ability to lead the party that I could have."

Reagan's endorsement comes as McCain continues to face critical conservative voters. It is possible that it could help McCain earn the support of conservatives who have not always viewed him as aligning with the party on certain issues. At the same time, it could help to align McCain with former President Ronald Reagan, who attracted Republican and Democratic voters.
