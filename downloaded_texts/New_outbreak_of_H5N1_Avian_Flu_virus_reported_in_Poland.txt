At least two new outbreaks of the H5N1 Avian Flu virus, also known as Bird Flu, have been found in Poland.

One of the outbreaks was on a farm in Saldowo which affected at least 40 chickens. The other outbreak was found in unnamed wild birds near Orneta.

"The new case was discovered in the village of Saldowo, near to Bieżuń, (central Poland) close to other recent cases. Just as in the previous cases all the chickens will be culled," said Poland's Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, Marek Sawicki.

Officials have set up a zone of protection of at least a 30 kilometer radius of the farm.
