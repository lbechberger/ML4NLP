West Indies have beaten England by 93 runs in the third and final One-Day International of the West Indies tour of England at Trent Bridge, Nottingham, England. West Indies win the three match series 2-1.

England's bowlers fared poorly, despite removing Devon Smith early on, with the West Indies batsmen scoring 116 runs off the last ten overs. Runako Morton (82 not out), Chris Gayle (82) and Dwayne Bravo (42 off 24 balls) helped the West Indies to an imposing total of 289-5. The only wickets for England were taken by Liam Plunkett (3-59) and James Anderson (2-51).

In response, England's batting performance was no better than their fielding. Although Owais Shah scored 51, England lost too many batsmen cheaply including Kevin Pietersen for 0. They were reduced to 196 all out, far short of the 290 runs needed. Fidel Edwards took 3-30 and Daren Powell took 4-40 for the West Indies.

Previously on the tour, England won a four match Test series 3-0 and drew a two match Twenty20 series 1-1.
