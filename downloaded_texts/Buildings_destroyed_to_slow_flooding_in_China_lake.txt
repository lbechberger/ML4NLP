Chinese troops today destroyed a variety of debris, including wooden houses, as part of an effort to slow the flooding of a lake. A lake had formed after the large earthquake that hit Jiangyou, and troops are now trying to subside the water flow to contain flooding. They are doing this with the intention of forming a spillway, which aims to divert the continuing flow of water from the heavily populated areas.

The Tangjiashan Lake formed when a large earthquake hit China last month and it has continued to expand despite efforts to halt its growth. 

Police have remained on high alert since China was hit by the Sichuan earthquake, which has resulted in thousands of deaths.
