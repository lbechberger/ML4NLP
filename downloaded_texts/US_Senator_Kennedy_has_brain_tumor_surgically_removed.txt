Today, United States Senator Ted Kennedy underwent surgery for a brain tumor at Duke University Medical Center. Kennedy, 76, was diagnosed with malignant glioma, a common but dangerous form of cancer, after suffering a seizure on May 17.

Kennedy has met repeatedly with friend and medical advisor Dr. Lawrence C. Horowitz to plan a course of treatment. The first, of the major phases of that treatment has now been completed, and it is expected that chemotherapy and radiotherapy will follow.

"I am pleased to report that Senator Kennedy's surgery was successful and accomplished our goals," said Dr. Allan Friedman, the chief of neurosurgery at Duke, who performed the surgery. "After a brief recuperation, he will begin targeted radiation at Massachusetts General Hospital and chemotherapy treatment," Friedman added.

In talks with the press, the senator has focused on his future beyond surgery. In a prepared statement issued by his office, Kennedy stated, "after completing treatment, I look forward to returning to the United States Senate and to doing everything I can to help elect Barack Obama as our next president."
