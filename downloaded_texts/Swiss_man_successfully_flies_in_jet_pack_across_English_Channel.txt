Yves Rossy, 49, an airline pilot from Switzerland, has successfully completed a trip across the English Channel using a jet propelled pack. He is said to be the first human to successfully complete any such trip.

Rossy flew between England and France, approximately 22 miles, with his top speed reaching 120 miles an hour. Rossy, who has named himself 'Fusion Man' began his trip in a plane. When they reached an altitude of 8,000 feet, Rossy jumped out of the plane and started his jet pack. The trip took just about 10 minutes to complete with Rossy landing via parachute in Dover in England.

The pack is described as hang glider like, with a wing span of eight feet. When the fuel tank is filled, the device weighs about 120 pounds. Rossy was protected by a fire proof suit in case anything went wrong, an extra parachute and a helmet.

Rossy had spent nearly five years designing and building the jet pack.
