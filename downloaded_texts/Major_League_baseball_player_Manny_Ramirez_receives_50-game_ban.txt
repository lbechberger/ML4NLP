Major League Baseball player Manny Ramirez of the Los Angeles Dodgers, has stated that he has been tested positive for a banned substance. As a result, he will be benched for 50 games.

The baseball players' union stated, Ramirez said the positive test resulted from a medication prescribed by a doctor, and not from a steroid. Ramirez waived his right to challenge the suspension.

Said Ramirez: "Recently I saw a physician for a personal health issue. He gave me a medication, not a steroid, which he thought was okay to give me. Unfortunately, the medication was banned under our drug policy. Under the policy that mistake is now my responsibility. I have been advised not to say anything more for now. I do want to say one other thing; I've taken and passed about 15 drug tests over the past five seasons."

Ramirez is the biggest star player to test positive for drugs since Rafael Palmeiro, and the first major star to be suspended under baseball's stricter drug-testing rules.

Ramirez is reported to lose at least 31% of his US$25-million salary as a result of the suspension. He will be allowed to resume playing baseball on July 3, 2009.
