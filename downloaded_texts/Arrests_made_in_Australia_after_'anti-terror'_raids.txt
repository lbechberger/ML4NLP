Seventeen people have been arrested overnight in Sydney and Melbourne, in what Police have described as 'anti-terror' raids. New South Wales (NSW) and Victorian police conducted the raids, and both police chiefs have said that the action foiled a terrorist plot. New South Wales Police Commissioner Ken Moroney said that, "we have disrupted what I would regard as the final stages of a terrorist attack or the launch of a terrorist attack in Australia." The Guardian is reporting that some of those arrested in Sydney are alleged to have been stockpiling chemicals. 

Some of those arrested in Melbourne have appeared in court, including Abu Bakr, also known as Abdul Nacer Benbrika. Benbrika was criticised last year for comments he made in support of al-Qaeda.
