Abbie Hawkins, a Norwich, United Kingdom hotel receptionist, 19, has found a baby bat in her bra. Hawkins originally mistook the bat for her cellphone. 

Hawkins said that she got dressed at 7:30 a.m. and arrived for work without noticing anything unusual. When she was driving to work, she felt a slight vibration, but she dismissed that as her mobile phone in her pocket. At around noon, Hawkins felt a strange movement inside her bra, which was hanging on her washing line the previous night.

Hawkins decided to investigate, and pulled out the baby bat, roughly the size of her hand, out of her bra. Commenting later on the baby bat, Hawkins said that "it looked very snug in there and I thought how mean I was for disturbing it." The baby bat was eventually released into the hotel's garden.

Jaime Eastham, of the Bat Conservation Trust, said that she has never heard of a bat being in a bra; however, bats will roost anywhere that looks dark and safe.
