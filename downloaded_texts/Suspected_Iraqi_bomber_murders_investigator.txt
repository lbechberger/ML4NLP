A man suspected of being involved in a bombing targeting Iraqi ministries stole a gun from an officer, wounded a officer and mortally wounded a senior investigator, reported Iraqi officials Sunday.


After being wounded, investigator Arkan Hachim returned fire at the suspect and fatally wounded him, according to the Ministry of the Interior.

Officials declared the incident "a dereliction", and said they would investigate further into the shooting. The Ministry has not yet identified the suspect, and did not give any information concerning evidence of the man's involvement nor the time of the shooting.

The bombs targeted the Justice Ministry and the Baghdad Provincial Council buildings, killing close to 160 people and injuring hundreds. 

The handgun was taken while a guard escorted the suspect to get a drink of water, and wounded the guard after taking the gun.

Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki believes that Sunni insurgents are the cause of the bombings, and has asked the UN to investigate.
