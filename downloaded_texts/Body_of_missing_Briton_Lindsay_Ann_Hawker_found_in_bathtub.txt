A woman found buried in sand in a bathtub has been named as missing Briton Lindsay Ann Hawker.

The body of the 22-year-old English language teacher was identified by colleagues after it had been found on the balcony of a flat in Ichikawa, Chiba Prefecture, Japan. She arrived from England about three months ago, and worked in a conversation school.

Police in Chiba prefecture are hunting a man who fled the apartment, to which she went each Saturday to give lessons to a Mr Tatsuya Ichihachi.
