At least two people have died and at least eight to ten were injured after two semi trucks collided in a truck tunnel on Interstate 5 (Newhall Pass) between Los Angeles and Santa Clarita California, United States, causing the tunnel to be completely shut down on both north and southbound lanes.

At approximately 11:00 p.m. (pacific time), two semi trucks collided and at least 13 other trucks smashed into the wreckage causing a massive fire. Firefighters are using foam to control the flames, which could take several hours to put out.

Officials say that the debris could take a day or more to remove and that a full inspection will have to be done on the tunnel before it can be used again because officials say that the structure of the tunnel has been compromised.

"It has impacted the structural stability of the tunnel," said John Tripp the Fire Chief for Los Angeles County who also said that there may be more people trapped in the wreckage.

"We're going to have to do a very methodical search. There could be unfortunately more people that were not able to escape," added Tripp.

The tunnel is 200 feet long.
