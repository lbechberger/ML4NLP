At least 58 people are now dead as a result of the recent flooding in Yemen, and at least 20,000 in the country have no access to shelter. Five people are also reported missing.The Yemeni government has pledged to send tents to help the homeless.

The flooding is caused by the recent heavy rain in Yemen, which came as a shock due to the fact that the country only receives several centimeters of rain per year.

In addition to the 58, four people were also killed by lightning, which struck Yemen during the large storms. 

The Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) released a statement regarding the floods. "The Secretary General of the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC), Professor Ekmeleddin Ihsanoglu, extended his sincere sympathy to the government and people of Yemen following the devastating floods caused by torrential rains, causing a grave humanitarian crisis in the governorates of Hadramaut and Mahra," it stated.

"Ihsanoglu pointed up the heavy death toll and the massive destruction that hit the infrastructure, such as roads, power and water distribution networks, describing the situation as a national disaster. He urged the international community to provide aid and assistance to the victims."
