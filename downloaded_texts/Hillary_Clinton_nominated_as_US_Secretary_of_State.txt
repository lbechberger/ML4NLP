United States President-elect Barack Obama has chosen his former presidential opponent, junior New York Senator Hillary Clinton, to be his next Secretary of State. Obama made his announcement in a press conference in a Chicago, Illinois hotel, where he also named the rest of his 'security' cabinet.

"I think she is going to be an outstanding secretary of state. And if I didn't believe that I wouldn't have offered her the job and if she didn't believe that I was equipped to lead this nation at this difficult time, she would not have accepted," said Obama. "Hillary's appointment is a sign to friend and foe of the seriousness of my commitment to renew American diplomacy and restore our alliances."

Clinton promised to give the job "her all", saying that "the American people have demanded not just a new direction at home, but a new effort to renew America's standing in the world as a force for positive change."

Before Obama would make the nomination, former President Bill Clinton had to agree to release information about the donors to his foundations. He has also agreed to disclose his sources of income to the United States Department of State and the White House.

Obama also named the rest of his security cabinet, confirming that he will continue with the current Secretary of Defense, Robert Gates. Obama also confirmed that retired U.S. Marine Corps general James L. Jones will be his next national security adviser and Susan Rice will be the next U.S. ambassador to the United Nations.

All of the nominations will require confirmation by the Senate, once Obama takes office as President.
