Ayman al-Zawahiri, Al-Qaeda's second in command, has released a new videotape.

In the tape Zawahiri says that Jesus and the Prophet Mohammed "are not sacred anymore.".

Zawahiri also referred to the Prophet Muhammad cartoons saying, "they did it on purpose and they continue to do it without apologizing, even though no one dares to harm Jews or to challenge Jewish claims about the Holocaust nor even to insult homosexuals. The insults against Prophet Muhammad are not the result of freedom of opinion but because what is sacred has changed in this culture. The Prophet Mohammed, prayers be upon him, and Jesus Christ, peace be upon him, are not sacred anymore, while Semites and the Holocaust and homosexuality have become sacred.".

In the video, Zawahiri also called for Muslims to attack the west. He also said Muslims need to prevent the West from "stealing Muslims' oil.".

"(Muslims have to) inflict losses on the crusader West, especially to its economic infrastructure with strikes that would make it bleed for years. The strikes on New York, Washington, Madrid and London are the best examples. We have to prevent the crusader West from stealing the Muslims' oil which is being drained in the biggest robbery in history. Reaching power is not a goal by itself ... and no Palestinian has the right to give away a grain of the soil. The seculars in the Palestinian Authority have sold out Palestine for crumbs... Giving them legitimacy is against Islam.".
