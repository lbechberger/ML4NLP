Allegations of paedophilia made against Indian guru, Sathya Sai Baba are back in the limelight again, after the UK's Sai Youth movement was recognised as an accredited partner of The Duke of Edinburgh's Award Scheme. 

The Baba's followers deny the allegations, and the Sai Youth UK's National Co-ordinator called them "totally unfounded". Sai Baba attracts followers from many countries around the world who revere him as a "living god".

Around 200 youth are due to fly to India on November 13th after receiving a "divine commandment" to carry out a month-long "humanitarian pilgrimage" that will coincide with the birthday celebrations of Sai Baba, who will be 81 on November 23rd. 

Pressure has been mounting on the Duke of Edinburgh award scheme charity to break its association with the Baba's organisation.
