Ferrari driver Michael Schumacher won the FIA Formula-1 French Grand Prix on the Circuit de Nevers Magny-Cours. 

With the help of a different pit-stop strategy Renault driver Fernando Alonso took second ahead of the other Ferrari of Felipe Massa. Massa had lead Alonso during the initial part of the race. 

Toyota did not live up to their promise in the qualifying session on Saturday with only one car finished, that of Ralf Schumacher. McLaren-Mercedes driver Kimi Raikkonen finished fifth. Pedro de la Rosa finished seventh. 

This was de la Rosa's first race this season. He had replaced Juan-Pablo Montoya in the McLaren hot seat, who left the team to start a career in NASCAR in the US.

This victory is the 150-th podium finish for Michael Schumacher, and cut down Alonso's lead in the championship race to 17 points. It was his eighth French Grand Prix victory - the first driver to win a Grand Prix eight times, which surpassed his own record of seven.
