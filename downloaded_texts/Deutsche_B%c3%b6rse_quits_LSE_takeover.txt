The owner of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, Deutsche BÃ¶rse has said it is quitting the takeover of the owner of the London Stock Exchange, LSE. Its planned GBP 1,3 billion (EUR 2 billion) takeover (530p per share) was stopped by opposition for various shareholders from both parties. Its announcement is a setback for the chief executive Werner Seifert. 

This just leaves the Euronext NV as the sole bidder of the LSE. It owns the stock exchanges in Paris, Amsterdam, Brussels, Lisbon and the tiny London-based exchange Liffe.
