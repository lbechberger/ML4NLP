The government of Cuba said that it will give total support to the principle of "one China", as expressed by the People's Republic of China government. 

The statement released on March 14 (Monday) by the Cuban Ministry of Foreign Affairs expressed strong disapproval of any external attempt to obstruct the Chinese objective of reunifying their country. According to Cuba, Taiwan is an inalienable part of China and the Cuban government rejects any attempt to consider Taiwan as an independent territory.

The note mentions the principle of territorial integrity established in the UN Charter and in Resolution 2758 passed by the General Assembly of UN in 1971. Resolution 2758 replaced the Republic of China with the People's Republic of China as China's representative in the UN.
