After announcing on Thursday that he was considering a comeback to Victorian state politics, former premier Jeff Kennett has ruled out a comeback.

Following the resignation of state opposition leader Robert Doyle, Mr Kennett announced that he had been approached several times about returning to politics over the past few months and that he was contemplating standing for the Victorian liberal party leadership. He announced today, at a press conference that he would not be returning to state politics.

When asked whether he would consider a move to federal politics, Mr Kennett said he had no intention of going to Canberra. "I have no intention of going to Canberra, I don't like flying and I don't like being away from home at night." he told the media.

Following Mr Kennett's announcement, Terry Mulder, the Victorian liberal's transport spokesperson said that he was withdrawing from the leadership race. His move paves the way for planning spokesperson Ted Baillieu to become the party's new leader unopposed.

Mr Mulder said that Mr Baillieu had "overwhelming" support within the party.

Australia's Prime Minister, John Howard said that he believed Mr Baillieu would make a very good leader, but was disappointed that Mr Kennett had ruled out a comeback.
