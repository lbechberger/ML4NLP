Damir Voschion, 46, has reportedly killed five members of his family in Pula, Croatia on Thursday night around 7:00 p.m. CET (UTC+1). They were all killed by gunshots to the head. The victims include Damir's two-month-old nephew, his seven-year-old niece, his brother, sister-in-law and then his father. The massacre took place in the family's home.

Damir turned himself in to police after about an hour and confessed to them "I killed them all". The bodies of the family have been transported to the morgue at the Pula General Hospital.

The motive for the massacre is not yet known, but there are theories that it might involve a property dispute between Damir and his brother. Neighbors say that Damir was a violent man and that at one time killed his brother's dog with his bare hands.
