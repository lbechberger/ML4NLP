The game publisher Konami stated today in a Japanese newspaper that they will not be releasing the game Six Days in Fallujah. The game is based on the Second Battle of Fallujah, a vicious battle between American and Iraqi forces.

"After seeing the reaction to the video game in the United States and hearing opinions sent through phone calls and e-mail, we decided several days ago not to sell it," Tokyo based Konami told the newspaper. â€œWe had intended to convey the reality of the battles to players so that they could feel what it was like to be there."

The developer of the game, Atomic Games, received controversial feedback from families of dead soldiers stating the game's concept as "exploitative and distasteful", as paraphrased by the The Wall Street Journal.

That paper also quoted a woman whose son had died in the Iraq war, who said "These people who aren't affected by the war get to sit on their couch and play this 'fun' game."

Video game developer Atomic Games has not yet stated a reaction to Konami's announcement.
