Monthly donors to the Greenpeace in the UK have received a shock recently, as their specified amounts were multiplied by 100. Thus, a "direct debt donation" of £2 monthly would have come out at £200, and donations of £50 became £5000.

The environmental charity says that they will reimburse donors by January 3, and also pay any extra bank charges incurred.

John Sauven, a director at the NGO said "We are still trying to find out how this glitch happened but for some reason two noughts seem to have been added, or the computer has converted pence into pounds. Our IT specialists are trying to work it out and rectify it to make sure it doesn't happen again. The only people who will be out of pocket are us."

One supporter told The Herald that she'd no longer let Greenpeace access her bank account. 

Over 221,000 Brits support the organization; the number of those affected was unknown.
