Alain Jaubert, director of the famous art program "Palettes" by Association Relative à la Télévision Européenne (ARTE) was invited by Taiwan Public Television Service (PTS Taiwan) and the French Institute in Taipei to talk about productions on his art program on January 19 in Taipei City. He also talked about some experiences and functionalities on art programs with the Chairman of National Culture and Arts Foundation Mingchuan Huang.

According to PTS Taiwan, Jaubert failed at his first attempt to produce "Palettes" in 1984, but finally succeeded in 1987 after his proposal was recalled and Jaubery tried another production style to introduce history and background on establishments of notable pictures to Europe. This program was finally recognized and encouraged by administration centers from three ancient monuments (Louvre, Musée d'Orsay, and Pompidou Centre). This also echoed Jaubert's words in his speech: "Without support by art comrades and those administrations centers, 'Palettes' would not exist; I wouldn't have become notable in Europe."

Before the Executive Panel, the PTS Taiwan screened highlights from some art programs including "Pelettes" by ARTE and "Avant Guard Liberation" by Mingchuan Huang. After the screening, executives talked about specifications on art programs and forecasted the future of directions on art programs world-wide.
