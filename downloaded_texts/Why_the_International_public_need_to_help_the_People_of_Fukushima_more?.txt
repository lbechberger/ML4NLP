Since radiation started to leak from the Fukushima nuclear power in March of 2011 it is time to reflect upon what has been done to prevent further impact to the environment. We should look at the international response and see if they are doing enough. Recently the Tokyo Electric Power Company developed plans to complete the building of a sea wall outside the number 1 reactor. 
 
TEPCO have now completed the wall as experts believe that it will decrease the amount of contaminated water being released into the Pacific Ocean. Since the sea wall has been completed TEPCO plan to work on a new configuration of the drainage system. This means they will collect surface water from different parts of the plant and send it through a new covered channel. 

The cleaning up of the Fukushima plant has cost an enormous amount of money for TEPCO and the Japanese government but the international community are not helping either. There has been a failure from worldwide mainstream media outlets with not keeping up with the latest developments of Fukushima and not directly informing the public. Environmental officials and Scientists have displayed their deep concerns on events and effects on the environment the plant disaster has had. 

On September 2015 a biologist from Kodiak Wildlife National Refuge Robin Corcoran stated that dead birds had washed up on beaches of Kodiak Island. It was the first major fatality in birds in the same area since January of 2012. The wildlife refuge also confirmed that toxic algae, leaking or radiation and global warming caused a rapid decline in birds across the Pacific Ocean. Birds are just an example of species that are affected by nuclear radiation. It is unknown why the mainstream media will not report on issues like this. There needs to be further recognition from the international community.
