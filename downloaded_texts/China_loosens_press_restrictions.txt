The Chinese government has decided to allow foreign reporters freedom of movement and information in most of China, between Jan. 1, 2007, until Oct. 17, 2008 in order to better cover the Olympics. The Games will be held in August 2008.

Foreign reporters will also be able to report and interview without approval from government censors during the regulatory hiatus.

The freedoms will not apply to Tibet or Xinjiang, two sensitive territories. Nor will Chinese journalists be granted the same freedoms.
