The British celebrity chef John Burton Race has been charged with the offence of drink-driving.

The chef, who is famous for starring in such programmes as French Leave and Return of the Chef, was pulled over by police on the A379 road in the county of Devon, England. The location was near to his restaurant entitled, "The New Angel". It was a routine check that took place in the early hours of Friday morning. After a breathalyser test, the chef was arrested for drink-driving. Another offence that he is being charged with is "resisting or obstructing a constable", which means to resist arrest.

A Devon and Cornwall Constabulary spokeswoman released a statement to Sky News which said: "John Burton Race, 52, was arrested on October 30 at about 1am. He has been charged with driving or attempting to drive with excess alcohol and resisting or obstructing a constable in the execution of their duty."

John has now been released on an unconditional bail. He is expected to appear before magistrates in a courtroom in Newton Abbot on November 17, 2009.
