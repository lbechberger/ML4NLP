The BJP backed democratic alliance in Nagaland was removed from state government and president's rule imposed in India's north-eastern state. The sacking of the state government was recommended by the central government to President of India Pratibha Patil. The state is now getting ready for elections in February 2008. 

On December 13, 2007 Chief Minister of Nagaland Rio had survived a no-confidence motion in state assembly with count 23-19 in the 60-member House. The speaker of the house had barred 3 independents from taking part in voting and had declared that the votes of 9 dissident of ruling NPF were invalid. This controversial voting had sparked debate and prompted the center to recommend for president's rule in state.
