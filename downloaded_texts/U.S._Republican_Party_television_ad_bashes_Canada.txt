A "critical" campaign ad, launched by the US Republican Party, that took a swipe at Canada has been pulled.

"Canada can take care of North Korea," a man in the television ad says. "They're not busy."

The ad's purpose was to blast Democratic Senate candidate Harold Ford Jr, who is running against Republican Bob Corker. The comment about Canada is secondary to the ad's first purpose.

An official for the Republican National Committee told NBC the ad had been pulled because it had "run its course," just one day after party chairman Ken Mehlman defended the ad and said it would continue to run.

"Just imagine if I registered a complaint every time my country or president was criticized," said the U.S. Ambassador to Canada, David Wilkins. "Compare that (one ad) with the criticism early this year during the (federal) election that happened every day in Canada ...ads that were run consistently throughout your country."

A source within the Canadian government told the Canadian Press that Canadian ambassador to the U.S. Michael Wilson called the White House to remind the Republicans of the heavy load Canada is carrying in Afghanistan.

The Canadian Embassy in Washington has been on an advertising campaign, plastering subway stations in Washington with posters depicting Canadian troops in Afghanistan. There is also a website featuring military cooperation between Canada and the U.S.

The Canadian ambassador to the U.S. has issued a complaint to Washington in response to the television ad.

The 30 second ad (see source below) can now be viewed on YouTube.
