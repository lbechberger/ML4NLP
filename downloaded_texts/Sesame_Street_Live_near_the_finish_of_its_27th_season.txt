After "Elmo Makes Music" played for four days at the Everett Events Center in Everett, Washington, Sesame Street Live wrapped up all of its North American dates in its 27th season.

After a three week break, Sesame Street Live will start the new season in Rochester, Minnesota on August 24.

By far the longest running touring stage show, Sesame Street Live has played in 19 countries worldwide since its debut in 1980. During the summer, "Super Grover! Ready for Action" will tour Bangkok and Metro Manila. The performances star professional dancers in character costumes based on the ever-popular Sesame Street Muppets.

Next year VEE Corporation, which runs SSL, will launch a new show: "When Elmo Grows Up". The show's first performance will be in La Crosse, Wisconsin on August 23 this year. "Super Grover! Ready for Action" will become a theatre tour, allowing it to play in cities without an arena large enough for the original production. "Elmo Makes Music" will continue to tour arenas across the continent.
