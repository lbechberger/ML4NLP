Bermuda, in the North Atlantic Ocean, is under a hurricane warning after Hurricane Gonzalo was upgraded to Category 4 on the Saffirâ€“Simpson hurricane wind scale earlier today. 

The hurricane is moving up the North Atlantic Ocean with 140 mph winds (about 225 kph), according to the National Hurricane Center in Miami, Florida. The storm is supposed to come near Bermuda on Friday, and could actually hit Bermuda, according to officials. As a precaution, Bermuda's L.F. Wade International Airport plans to close until the storm has passed.

The hurricane has already hit the Caribbean earlier this week. One person was killed and a dozen others were injured in that region.

Last weekend, another storm hit Bermuda, causing a power outage and residents were recovering from the damage. Winds from that storm reached 70 miles per hour on Sunday morning and it reached hurricane status on Sunday evening, only to be downgraded again later that night.

Meanwhile, tropical storm Ana in the Pacific Ocean is being monitored and officials predict will become a hurricane this weekend. Winds from this storm reached 60 mile per hour. It could hit Hawaii if it stays on its predicted path.
