A suicide bomber killed at least 42 Pakistani soldiers at an army training centre today in the North West Frontier Province, according to Pakistani government soldiers.

The attack took place in the town of Dargai, 100 km north of Peshawar at 8:40 a.m. local time (0310 UTC) today.

20 people were injured in the attack. Some of them are in a critical condition. The injured were admitted to hospitals in Mardan and Peshawar.

Aftab Ahmed Sherpao, Pakistani Federal Minister of Interior, said that the attack was carried out by a man who got down from a car wearing a chaddor [cloak] and walked into the parade. He added, "After the Bajaur incident this was expected, but we will continue the fight against terror. We condemn it, innocent lives were lost."

Pakistani president General Pervez Musharraf condemned the suicide attack and directed the interior ministry to track down the culprits involved in the attack.

No group has claimed for the responsibility of the attack yet.
