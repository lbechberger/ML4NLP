A sell-out crowed showed up at the Estadio Mestalla in Spain to watch Valencia take on Inter Milan in the second leg of the Champions League round of sixteen. The first match ended 1-1 at the San Siro in Italy, and Inter needed a win or a draw of 2-2 or higher to advance.

The first half presented little in the way of goal chances for either team, with the biggest action in the form of a penalty appeal from Inter's Hernan Crespo. Crespo claimed to have been taken down by Robert Ayala, but referee Wolfgang Stark waved away the appeals. The only real attacks came in the form of long range shots, with Ibrahimovic taking one for Inter, and Sanchez attempting a blast for Valencia, but neither produced a goal. Valencias keeper CaÃ±izares then took exception to a foul by Zlatan Ibrahimovic, and both players were dealt bookings by the referee. Another penalty was appealed for by Inter, with Crespo again involved. Inter claimed the Argentine's shot was blocked off the arm of Valencia'a Raul Albiol, but again the referee waved play on. Valencia was forced into a change when Baraja was injured and replaced him with Hugo Viana.

The second half showed slightly more in the way of chances, and Valencia in particular upped the pace. Inter coped and had their own chance but a header from Dejan Stankovic was hit into the side netting. Inter again threatened, and could have taken the lead, but Marco Materazzi's header was cleared off the line by Marchena. Inter pushed now, but Valencia looked the more likely to score in the closing minutes with Marchena and Joaquin both coming close. It didn't matter however, as Valencia won the series on away goals.

The game erupted in violence and several players took swings at each other. The display was truly disgraceful after the incidents in Italy, and UEFA is sure to envoke punishment once everything has calmed down.
