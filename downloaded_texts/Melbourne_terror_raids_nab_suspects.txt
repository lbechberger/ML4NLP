Australian Federal Police have caught four people suspected of plotting a terrorist attack in Melbourne. The suspects, all Australian citizens of Somali and Lebanese descent, were arrested early this morning Melbourne time.

"Police believe members of a Melbourne-based group have been undertaking planning to carry out a terrorist attack in Australia and allegedly involved in hostilities in Somalia," a police statement says.

"The men's intention was to actually go into the Army barracks and to kill as many soldiers as they could before they themselves were killed," acting Australian Federal Police deputy commissioner Tony Negus told a press conference. "This operation has disrupted an alleged terrorist attack that could have claimed many lives."

The raids were carried out by officers from Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, Australian Federal Police, Victoria Police, New South Wales Police and the New South Wales Crime Commission.
