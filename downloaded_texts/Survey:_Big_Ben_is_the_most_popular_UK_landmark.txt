A survey of over 2000 people has found that the London Clock Tower, containing the famous bell Big Ben, is the most popular landmark in the United Kingdom.

Stonehenge was voted second in the poll, which was launched to mark the birthday of Victorian engineer Isambard Kingdom Brunel.

No Brunel structures appeared in the list of the top 10. This is despite the fact that the poll was launched to mark the birthday of Brunel.
