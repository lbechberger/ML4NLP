Today, at 23:09 UTC, the internet encyclopedia Wikipedia reached the point of having over one million articles written in English. In comparison, the largest traditional English-language encyclopedia, EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica, has 120,000 articles. This milestone marks an important point in Wikipedia's short history.

There was minor confusion over the millionth article; it was first held to be Jordanhill Railway Station, then a brief biography of baseball player Aaron Ledesma. The millionth article was later confirmed to be the former, started by Wikipedia contributor Nach0king (Ewan Macdonald). "While I am, of course, delighted at being the one to hit this milestone, I must confess, along with many others I timed my contributions tonight to give me a chance at being the lucky one," he wrote on his Wikipedia user page.

Jimmy Wales commented that "We are thrilled that our millionth article in English is about the Jordanhill railway station. This is not something which would appear in a traditional encyclopedia, and it shows how Wikipedia reflects the needs and interests of people everywhere, and not just the dictates of what academics and cultural mavens claim is worthy of an encyclopedia."
