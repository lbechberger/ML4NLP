British singer Robbie Williams has announced that he will be returning to boyband Take That. 

The singer made the announcement during an interview with Jonathan Ross on Friday Night with Jonathan Ross, which is due to be aired on BBC One on Friday. Robbie has been quoted as saying, "We've got together, done bits and bobs." In response to a question about whether he would be appearing with the rest of Take That on stage in the future, Robbie said: "I can't say much but, yes, I hope so."

Take That originated in Manchester, England in 1990. The group disbanded in 1996, but reformed in 2005 without Robbie in it.

During the interview with Ross, Williams also revealed that he has made plans to have children with his girlfriend. "I thought I was going to be a bachelor," he said. "I was introduced to Ayda [Field] and things just changed. She's a wonderful person and I'm in love. She's really broody and I'm getting there." 

Robbie also spoke of his performance on the BBC Electric Proms on October 20, and the pressure that he suffered from. "I've always been very nervous [performing for] 80,000 people, it's an unnatural thing to do. You don't know what's going on in my head. It's traumatic, really scary. I ended up in rehab again. It was, 'What are you doing to yourself?' I thought it was time to break the cycle. I've taken the pressure off myself, it's a part-time gig these days. The missus keeps me grounded. There's no need to take myself out of my mind any more."

Robbie Williams recently made a live performance on The X Factor, a UK televised singing competition. The singer denied allegations that he is taking drugs. "I get incredibly nervous," he commented. "It wasn't drugs or drink, just deer in the headlights."
