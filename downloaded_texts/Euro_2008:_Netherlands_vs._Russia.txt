The Netherlands lost to the Russia national football team in a quarter-final match of UEFA Euro 2008. 

Roman Pavlyuchenko opened the scoring in main play, a goal that was matched by Ruud van Nistelrooy after only 30 minutes.

Then it was a hardy play-off for both teams, especially the Dutch, but Torbinsky and Arshavin scored goals, effectively put an end to the match. Arshavin was declared the Man of the Match.

Now it will be the first major semi final for Russia since the break up of the USSR.
