The Saskatchewan Roughriders have won the 95th Grey Cup in Toronto, Canada on Sunday after defeating the Winnipeg Blue Bombers by a 23-19 score. Saskatchewan last won the Cup in 1989, and their last appearance at the championship game was in 1997 against the Toronto Argonauts.

The Canadian Football League (CFL) championship game was held at Toronto's Rogers Centre before a crowd of 52,230. This is the first time these two western Canadian teams have met in a Grey Cup final. Despite Winnipeg's lead during the first and third quarters, Saskatchewan's offence proved too strong for the Blue Bombers in the end.

A half-time performance by rock musician Lenny Kravitz included the song "American Woman", originally performed by Winnipeg band The Guess Who.

On Thursday, Saskatchewan quarterback Kerry Joseph was declared this year's CFL Outstanding Player at a player awards ceremony in Toronto.

The Cup is named after Earl Grey who donated the trophy to honour Canada's most successful amateur rugby team. By the time the Canadian Football League was formed in 1958, the Cup became the top prize for professional football in Canada.

Next year's CFL championship game is scheduled at Montreal's Olympic Stadium.
