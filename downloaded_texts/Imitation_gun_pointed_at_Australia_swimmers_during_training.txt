Photos have emerged in the Australian media of a 9mm imitation pistol being pointed at swimmers by a coach. The incident occurred at a swimming camp where a number of young swimmers were training for next year's Commonwealth Games.

At the camp, Nathan Schrag, a Royal Australian Navy trainer, aimed the pistol at two swimmers whilst simultaneously firing a real pistol in the air. The two swimmers in question had just completed a two hour set.

It is believed that swimmers as young as 16 attended the camp. The officials responsible for the programme have stated that such methods will not be employed in the future. Meanwhile, Rod Kemp, the sports minister, has said that there is no place for such behaviour in sports training.
