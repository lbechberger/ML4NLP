Former United States President Gerald Ford has been hospitalized with pneumonia, an official announced today. Ford was admitted to the Eisenhower Medical Center in Rancho Mirage, California, USA.

Ford's chief of staff, Penny Circle, said in a press release, "He is doing well and resting comfortably." She added that there would be no further announcements until 11 AM on Tuesday.

Ford visited the hospital last month for a routine test, which he goes for every December. Circle said he had "a horrible cold." Ford last visited the hospital in January 2005 for a follow-up on his annual December checkup.

Ford, 92, was the nation's 38th president. After the death of Ronald Regan in 2004, he became the oldest American president alive.
