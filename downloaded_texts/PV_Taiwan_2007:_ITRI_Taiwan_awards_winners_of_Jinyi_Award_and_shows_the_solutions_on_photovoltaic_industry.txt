Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI) showed their solutions of excellence not only at TAITRONICS Autumn and TaiwanRFID exhibitions, but also held "The 4th Jinyi Award Ceremony" and "Photovoltaic Applications on Construction Seminar" accompanied with PV Taiwan Forum and Exhibition this year.

For the "Jinyi Award", ITRI set a special pavilion at their booth to show the nominated products and current solutions with solar energy. According to ITRI, "Jinyi Award" encouraged individual or group participants can applied the creations on solar energy and photovoltaics to life of the human beings. ITRI also hoped those solutions can transform with valued products. This year, ITRI cooperated with Taiwan Design Center supervised by Taiwan External Trade Development Council (TAITRA) with judgments of the 4th Jinyi Award.

This competition has three groups (Product Design, Professional Design, Design Competition) with different natures, competition places, and fields of participants. Winners of "Professional Design Group" and the 1st and 2nd place of "Design Competition Group" were named at the Ceremony.

After the Ceremony, ITRI held "Photovoltaic Applications on Construction Seminar" for participants with semiconductor, photovoltaic, environment, and constriction industries. "Governments and companies in Taiwan should learn some successful cases in Europe and USA. ITRI started constructions of photovoltaic and solar energy system at South Taiwan. Photovoltaic and solar energy are the valuable and important energy source from now, and its industry will be taken effect on some environment issues such as increasing of oil prices, greenhouse effect, trendy changes of environment awareness." Dr. Joeng-shein Chen (Deputy Manager of Photovoltaics Technology Center of Industrial Technology Research Institute) taught to the participants at this seminar.
