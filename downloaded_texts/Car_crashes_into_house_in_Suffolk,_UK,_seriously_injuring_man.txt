A male driver has been hospitalised with serious head injuries after the car he was in crashed into the corner of a house in Suffolk in the east of the United Kingdom. Members of the fire service attended the incident scene, which occurred in the Carlton Colville district of the town of Lowestoft, approximately seven minutes after it was reported to emergency services at approximately 0145 UTC today.

Although three people were inside the house when the car impacted it, none of them were hurt. However, the driver sustained serious injuries to the head. The road where the crash happened was temporarily closed while emergency services freed the driver from the red Audi TT. He was initially hospitalised in the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth. He was subsequently relocated to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.

Structural engineers have been asked to examine the house. The house has been vacated by its occupants as analysis continues, police reported. It is not clear if the collision has caused the building to leak gas.

The cause of the incident is unknown at this stage. "Collision investigators will be at the scene today as we try to ascertain exactly what has occurred", said Sergeant Bob Patterson. The Suffolk Constabulary Sergeant added: "At this early stage we could not speculate as to what has caused the crash."
