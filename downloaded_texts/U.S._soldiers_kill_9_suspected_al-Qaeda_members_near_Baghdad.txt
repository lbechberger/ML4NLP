United States forces killed nine suspected al-Qaeda members in a raid at a town around 12 miles south of Baghdad on Thursday. 

Soldiers told residents in the area to get out of their homes after they noticed several armed men in a nearby wooded area. The soldiers then asked for air support, which killed nine of the insurgents. The insurgents were wearing high explosives, say the soldiers. 

Nine other suspected insurgents were arrested in the raid.
