Sinn Fein has expel its former head of administration, Denis Donaldson, after he confessed to being a British spy since 1980.

Mr. Donaldson said he deeply regretted his activities over the last twenty years

In a statement to RTE News, he described the Stormont spying allegations as a sham. 

Taoiseach Bertie Ahern said the incident was 'as bizarre as it gets'. The UK government has been challenged for an inquiry over the matter.

"Blair needs to explain whether he knew Donaldson was an agent and, if not, how that could credibly be so," said Jim Allister of the Democratic Unionist Party. "The Prime Minister should make a full statement to Parliament on Monday."
