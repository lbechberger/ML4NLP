Suspected Maoist guerrillas killed eight Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) jawans in Chattisgarh, India yesterday, blowing up a bullet-proof police patrol in the Bijapur district of the state. It was the first major attack by Maoists in the area since 76 people were killed in an ambush incident at Dantewada.

The naxalites detonated an improvised explosive device near Pedakodepal village, located on National Highway 16 in Bijapur, then opened fire at security men, confirmed by the Director General of Police of Chattisgarh. The driver of the vehicle was also killed in the incident. One jawan was severely wounded and another missing, he added. The injured are being treated in a Jagdalpur hospital.

"It appears that the security personnel ignored the instruction not to travel in any kind of vehicle in the naxal-infested areas," Home Minister of Chattisgarh, Nankiram Kanwar said. "The Maoists appear to be working with a better intelligence network and the forces need to be more alert."
