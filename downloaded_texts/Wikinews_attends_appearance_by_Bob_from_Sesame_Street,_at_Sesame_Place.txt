"Bob from Sesame Street", actor and singer Bob McGrath, visited Sesame Place this Sunday for singing and book reading. One of the last remaining cast members from the 1969 first season, he is an accomplished singer with six children's albums to his credit, he performs family pop concerts and has appeared with more than 100 symphony orchestras in the U.S. and Canada. McGrath has authored eight books including Uh-Oh Gotta Go and Oops, Excuse Me Please.

Sesame Place opened for the season in May, adding Abby Cadabby to its cast of life-size Muppets. The park offers a variety of wet and dry rides, as well as stage attractions. Christy Carlson Romano performed at the park four times over last weekend, as well as riding in its daily Rock Around the Block Parade. Previously this season, Christy had four concerts at the park.

Wikinews is sending Lloyd David Photography to many of the concerts and Sesame Street cast meet-and-greets that are happening this year at the park. David specialises in headshots, models, event, and wedding photography.
