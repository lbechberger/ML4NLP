The Democratic Republic of the Congo may be preparing to have its troops face those of Rwanda, which have allegedly been sighted by United Nations personnel on the Congo side of the border. 

The United Nations is attempting to mediate the conflict but both sides of the conflict appear to be pursuing independent policies, with Congo's president accusing Rwanda of being predatory, and Rwandan president refusing to back down from the threat of pursuing Rwandan rebels across Congo's territory.
