Throughout the 2008 United States Presidential election campaign, Wikinews reporters have been talking to candidates of all political stripes, looking for their vision of America and campaign stories. This series continues now with Jackson Kirk Grimes of the United Fascist Union (UFU).

Mr. Grimes dictated the answers to Heather Goldsmith, his party's Propaganda Minister, who transcribed them for Wikinews.

Grimes has been the director and CEO of the UFU since 1996, and ran for the President's office in 2000 and 2004. Grimes is known internally as His Highness or His Excellency. He was a Storm Trooper for the Fascist Freedom Front, from 1967-1975. He was a Corporal for the United States Army (18th Corps of Army Engineers) from 1968-1972, certified stock broker in the 1990s, a member of the Screen Actors' Guild since 1996, and received his GED from the Ohio State Department of Education in 1991.

Note that Grimes appears not to have qualified for either ballot status or as a formally recognized write-in candidate in any state, according to Politics1.
