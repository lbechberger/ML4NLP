The New Zealand Electoral Commission has referred the Labour Party to the police for allegedly overspending NZ$418,603 in last year's general election.

Labour asserts that the money was not spent on an election related activity.

The Electoral Commission chief executive, Dr Helena Catt says "Election expense provisions exist to help ensure a fair contest".

Catt says it is unusual for the police to investigate a party for overspending. "It's the first one that I'm aware of under MMP". 

Meanwhile, election expense returns are still being sorted out. Only 13 of 22 parties met the 19th December deadline to have all returns in.
