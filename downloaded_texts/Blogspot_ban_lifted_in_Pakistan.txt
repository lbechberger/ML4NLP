As of 6th May, 2006, the Pakistani government has once again put a ban on Blogspot. This has been confirmed by numerous bloggers across Pakistan.

The banned blogs can now be accessed through an alternative sites such as PKBlogs.com - Blogspot Proxy and other proxy servers.



Since the morning of May 2, 2006, the blanket ban on the blogspot.com blogs has been lifted. This has been confirmed by various people on the 'Action Group Against Blogspot Ban In Pakistan' mailing list. The six baloch and plenty of Indian sites are still blocked.

The website was originally blocked because some of the blogs it hosted, reportedly contained "sacrilegious" content, mostly in the form of cartoons that were earlier published by Jyllands-Posten, and republished in some Blogs. The Supreme Court of Pakistan directed the government of Pakistan to block all websites that contained such content on March 1, 2006.
