A police station has been hit by a bomb in Naciria, which is in the northern part of Algeria and is about 50 km east of the Algerian capital Algiers.

According to reports, at least 4 people are dead and several are injured. Full details have not yet been released. The bomb went off at about 0600 UTC (7 AM local time) today.

It is currently not clear whether the bombing was caused by a car bomb or a suicide attack.

The bombing, although less serious than the December bombings which killed 40 people, is likely to raise suspicions that violence has not ended in Algeria. It is the first bombing to hit Algeria since the bombings in early December.

The bombing was announced in a statement by a spokesman for the Algerian Interior Ministry in which the following was said - "There has been an attack with explosives near a police station in Naciria. The attack left three dead and seven wounded." 

Frequent terrorism first hit Algeria after measures were carried out by the government to stop a Muslim fundamentalist party winning the elections. That party has now been banned. 

A witness of the event said that the majority of injuries hit police officers and not the general public.
