A bus accident in the north of Tanzania located approximately 15 miles to the east of Mount Kilimanjaro killed at least 54 people and injuring 20 after falling into the Malala river. Police say that the bus was packed with too many people and witnesses claim the bus was speeding.

"There were some (people) that were standing, plus cargo on top...It is not allowed within the law because the bus's capacity is 26 passengers," said Arusha regional commissioner, Abbas Kandoro. He also said the bus had at least 74 people on board.

"The bus was carrying 74 passengers. Fifty four people have died," added Kandoro.

A crane has been called in to assist in the rescue and police fear that more bodies will be found under the wreckage.

The people were traveling from Arusha to Mererani.
