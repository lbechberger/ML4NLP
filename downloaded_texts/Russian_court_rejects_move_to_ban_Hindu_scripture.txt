A judge in Tomsk, Russia drew a round of applause from the court room as she dismissed charges of extremism against the Bhagavad Gita As It Is, a Russian commented translation of the Bhagavad Gita published by the International Society for Krishna Consciousness. This decision put an end to the six-month-long trial of the book accused by the state prosecutors of fostering "social discord" and "incitement to religious hatred". 

The Indian Foreign Ministry, which had been urging Moscow to avert the possible ban they termed as "absurd", welcomed the verdict calling it "a sensible resolution of a sensitive issue" which "demonstrates yet again that the people of India and Russia have a deep understanding of each other's cultures and will always reject any attempt to belittle our common civilizational values" and thanked the Russian government for their support. Indian Ambassador to Russia Ajai Mahotra also stated that the court decision "deserves to be applauded".

The controversial court case on the Bhagavad Gita, an ancient text regarded sacred by millions of Hindus, had threatened to become a stumbling block in traditionally strong Indo-Russian relations as it caused political and societal turmoil in India, with the Indian Parliament stalled over the proposed ban and Hindu activists burning Russian flags. The trial also evoked strong criticism from the international media.
