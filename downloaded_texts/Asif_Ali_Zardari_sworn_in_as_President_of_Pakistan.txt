Asif Ali Zardari has been sworn in as the President of Pakistan. The 53-year-old Zardari took oath from Chief Justice Abdul Hameed Dogar in Islamabad on Tuesday.

He took the oath as the twelfth President of Pakistan. On Sept. 6, Zardari, secured 479 votes from the total number of 702 votes of the electoral college consisting of two houses of the parliament and four provincial assemblies.
