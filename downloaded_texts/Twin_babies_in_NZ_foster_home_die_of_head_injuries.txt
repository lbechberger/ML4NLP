The New Zealand police who are investigating the deaths of male twin babies say that they suffered from serious head injuries.

The two babies were named Chris Kahui and Cru Kahui. They lived in a auckland house with 12 family members. Child, Youth and Family have removed two other children living at the Mangere home.

The police are investigating a double homicide after the two babies were taken off life support at Starship Hospital, Auckland. The twins were admitted to Starship on Tuesday June 13. At the time of admission they both suffered from head injuries and one suffered from a broken thigh.

A post-mortem revealed that the babies had died from numerous injuries and brain damage, however police cannot tell if any of the injuries were historical.

New Zealand is ranked third for the rate of child murder in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).
