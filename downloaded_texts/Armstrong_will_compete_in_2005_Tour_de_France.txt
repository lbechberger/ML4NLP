Lance Armstrong has announced that he will attempt to win a seventh Tour de France crown in 2005.

The 34-year-old Texan announced his intentions in a statement on Wednesday, ending months of speculation.

Armstrong, who suffered from testicular cancer from 1996 to 1998, has won six straight Tour de France titles; a feat no-one else has achieved. 

This season, Armstrong will be riding with the Discovery Channel Pro Cycling Team, after US Postal Service ended their sponsorship of his team last year.

Five times Tour runner-up and 1997 winner Jan Ulrich said in response to the news, "It's good that he is there. The best should be at the Tour."

Armstrong will also be racing in two other road cycling stage races in France and the U.S. this spring, and will be in a one-day race in Belgium in April. There is the possibility of Armstrong competing in more races this season if he and his team manager believe he is fit enough.
