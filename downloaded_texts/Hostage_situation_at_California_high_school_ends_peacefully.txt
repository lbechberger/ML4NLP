A 17-year-old high school student was arrested after holding a high school class hostage in Oroville, California. The gunman had reportedly planned to shoot a romantic rival, but been stymied when he couldn't find the other youth.

Entering a classroom he expected to find empty, intending to commit suicide, the student discovered a class in progress - and instead fired several shots in to the air and decided to instigate a hostage situation, seizing the 25 students and their substitute teacher. 

Thirty minutes into the crisis, speaking by cellphone with a hostage negotiator, the student had agreed to release nearly all the hostages, except three students and the teacher.

After about an hour, the student surrendered and the situation ended peacefully. 

The student has been charged with attempted murder, forcible confinement and bringing a gun to school.

The situation occurred exactly one year and one day after another hostage situation in Colorado.
