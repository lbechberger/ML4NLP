Senator Ted Kennedy, a Democrat from Massachusetts, who was recently hospitalized after suffering two seizures, has been diagnosed with a malignant brain tumor. Kennedy's doctors discovered the tumor as part of a battery of tests performed to diagnose the cause of the seizures. 

Late last week the senator was rushed to Cape Cod Hospital from the Kennedy Compound, after reportedly suffering stroke-like symptoms. After two hours in the emergency room, he was flown to Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts.

A statement given by Dr. Lee Schwamm and Dr. Larry Ronan of Massachusetts General Hospital stated, "Over the course of the last several days, we've done a series of tests on Senator Kennedy to determine the cause of his seizure. He has had no further seizures, remains in good overall condition, and is up and walking around the hospital." 

The statement went on to say, "However, preliminary results from a biopsy of the brain identified the cause of the seizure as a malignant glioma in the left parietal lobe. The usual course of treatment includes combinations of various forms of radiation and chemotherapy." 

The statement finished by saying, "Decisions regarding the best course of treatment for Senator Kennedy will be determined after further testing and analysis. Senator Kennedy will remain at Massachusetts General Hospital for the next couple of days according to routine protocol. He remains in good spirits and full of energy."
