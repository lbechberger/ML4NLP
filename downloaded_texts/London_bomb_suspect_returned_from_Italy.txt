The London bomb suspect, Hussain Osman, also known as Hamdi Issac, has arrived in London and been arrested following his extradition from Italy.
Allegedly involved in the second set of attacks on London in July, which targeted the city's public transport infrastructure, Osman was arrested in Rome by Italian police on July 29, just one week after the failed attacks.

On September 13, a final appeal against extradition was rejected by an Italian court despite his lawyer's protests that he could not get a fair trial in the UK. Osman is accused of planting the failed bomb at Shepherd's Bush Underground station. His flight subsequent to the attack proved futile as phone records led police to Rome, and a raid on his brother's apartment, where he was captured.

Pending his extradition, he was held at Rebibbia jail, Rome, a high-security facility on the outskirts of the city. He left the jail late on Thursday and the Ethiopian-born terror suspect flew out of Italy at 12pm local time, accompanied by officers from the Metropolitan police. Flying on a chartered private jet, Osman and his escort landed at RAF Northolt, where Osman was charged on arrival. He is expected to be put on trial at the Old Bailey in London, alongside the other suspects involved in the failed attacks.
