The Iraqi military has said that it arrested more than 60 security force members in connection with the recent series of bombings in Baghdad that killed about 155 people.

A military spokesman said on Thursday the arrests included eleven military officers. He did not say whether the army suspected the detained officers of involvement in the blasts or of negligence in protecting the Iraqi capital. 

Sunday's car bombings targeted Iraq's justice ministry and a provincial government building. An al-Qaeda-linked group claimed responsibility for the attacks. Hundreds of people were hurt and several government buildings were badly damaged after the attacks, which were the deadliest to strike the country since 2007.
