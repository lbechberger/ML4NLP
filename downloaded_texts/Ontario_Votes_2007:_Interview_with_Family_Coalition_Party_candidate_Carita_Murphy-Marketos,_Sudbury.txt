Carita Murphy-Marketos is running for the Family Coalition Party in the Ontario provincial election, in the Sudbury riding. Wikinews' Nick Moreau interviewed her regarding her values, her experience, and her campaign.

Carita did not answer "What prior political experience do you have? What skills and insight can you bring to office, from other non-political positions you may have held?"

Stay tuned for further interviews; every candidate from every party is eligible, and will be contacted. Expect interviews from Liberals, Progressive Conservatives, New Democratic Party members, Ontario Greens, as well as members from the Family Coalition, Freedom, Communist, Libertarian, and Confederation of Regions parties, as well as independents.
