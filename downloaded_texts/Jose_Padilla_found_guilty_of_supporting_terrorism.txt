Jose Padilla, who is a former Chicago gang member, was found by jury to be guilty of supporting Islamic terrorist groups abroad.

The co-defendants, Adham Hassoun and Kifan Jayyousi, were also found guilty on conspiracy to murder, kidnap, and maim people in a foreign country; conspiracy to provide material support for terrorists; and providing material support for terrorists. 

All three defendants face life in prison. The sentencing is on December 5.

The Attorney General Alberto Gonzales issued a statement saying "The conviction of Jose Padilla -- an American who provided material support to terrorists and trained for violent jihad -- is a significant victory in our efforts to fight the threat posed by terrorists and their supporters."

Attorneys for the defendants claimed they will appeal the decision.
