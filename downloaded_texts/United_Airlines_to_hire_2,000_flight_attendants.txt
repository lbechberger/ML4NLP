The besieged airline industry received some good news today, United Airlines plans to hire 2,000 flight attendants. This is the first time in four years United has increased the number of flight attendants it employs. 

United Airlines, the second largest US carrier, furloughed many flight attendants as a result of decreased air travel after September 11th. At one time 5,500 flight attendants were on furlough. United finished recalling flight attendants on October 31st. The airline's problems were further aggravated by soaring fuel prices forcing the company to file for chapter 11 bankruptcy which it plans to emerge from in 2006. 

The new hires are intended to replace retirees and flight attendants who decided not to return from furlough. 

United stated that it will begin accepting applications November 13th at United flight attendant application page
