The official results of the 2007 Ontario General Election now show that the Ontario Liberal Party has been re-elected. The Liberal Party lead by Dalton McGuinty will spend the next four years in a majority government.

McGuinty is the first Liberal premier to have back-to-back majorities since Mitchell Hepburn, who held office from 1934-1942, with his second majority starting in 1937. Hepburn's government legacy includes the Queen Elizabeth Way and Rainbow Bridge to Niagara Falls, New York.
