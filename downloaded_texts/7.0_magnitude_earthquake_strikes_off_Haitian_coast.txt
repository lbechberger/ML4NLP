A 7.0 magnitude earthquake has struck off the coast of Haiti earlier today at 21:53 UTC, according to the US Geological Survey (USGS). According to the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, no tsunami warning was issued, contradicting some media reports that said there was one in place. The quake's magnitude was revised down from an initial report of 7.3 on the Richter scale.

"A destructive widespread tsunami threat does not exist based on historical earthquake and tsunami data," the US Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said. "However, there is the possibility of a local tsunami that could affect coasts located usually no more than a 100 km [60 miles] from the earthquake epicentre."

The USGS reports that the epicentre was fifteen kilometres (ten miles) southwest of Port-au-Prince and southeast of Miami, Florida, at a depth of ten kilometres.

According to USGS analyst Dale Grant, this tremor was "the largest quake recorded in this area"; the last strong quake was in 1984, and had a magnitude of 6.7, he noted.

"Everybody is just totally, totally freaked out and shaken. The sky is just gray with dust," said Henry Bahn, an official with the US Department of Agriculture who was visiting in Haiti and a witness to the incident. "I just held on and bounced across the wall. I just hear a tremendous amount of noise and shouting and screaming in the distance," he commented, as quoted by the Associated Press.

According to data from the USGS, there were thirteen aftershocks after the initial tremors, the strongest of which was 5.9 on the Richter scale; seven others measured in at 5.0 or higher â€“ all the aftershocks were 4.0 or greater.

No deaths have yet been reported, but a hospital in Port-au-Prince was damaged, and a US government official said several houses fell into a ravine. An analyst for USGS in Colorado commented that there could be many deaths from an earthquake of this strength. "I think we are going to see substantial damage and casualties," he said.

The USGS's Mike Blanpied remarked that about three million people were impacted by the earthquake, given its location. "This quake occurred under land as opposed to off-shore, so a lot of people were directly exposed to the shaking coming off that earthquake fault, which was quite shallow," he said.

A lack of communications makes it difficult to ascertain what damage was done. US embassy personnel were "literally in the dark" due to power failures, said State Department spokesman P. J. Crowley. "They reported structures down. They reported a lot of walls down. They did see a number of bodies in the street and on the sidewalk that had been hit by debris. So clearly, there's going to be serious loss of life in this," he said, as quoted by AP. A reporter for Reuters said he had seen "dozens of dead and injured people" amidst collapsed buildings.

"We are trying to get in touch with our people on the ground but we are experiencing communication problems, which is not unusual in a disaster such as this," said United Nations spokeswoman Stephanie Bunker to Agence France-Presse.
