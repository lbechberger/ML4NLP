Two top US Officials will be meeting with their counterparts in Ottawa on February 23.

Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Homeland Security Director Michael Chertoff will meet with Foreign Affairs Minister Peter MacKay, Public Safety Minister Stockwell Day, Trade Minister David Emerson, and their Mexican counterparts.

The top agenda item is expected to be border security, as American officials are concerned with Canada's slow progress in implementing new secure forms of identification. 

Currently, with the approval of the U.S. government, British Columbia and nearby Washington State have a pilot project that involves upgraded drivers' licences. 

Besides border security issues, the meeting is expected to address other issues like trade.
