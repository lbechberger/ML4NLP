Officials in Manila have issued evacuation orders for a 6km (4mi) radius around Mayon Volcano in the Philippines as ash clouds, rivulets of lava, and sulphur dioxide levels indicate an imminent explosive eruption.

Many residents, though, are hesitant to leave. Regional disaster coordinating council official Angel Capilli has said that the people who farm the rich soil near the volcano would be "forcibly" removed from the area should vulcanologists determine an explosive eruption is imminent.

Mount Mayon has erupted 47 times in recorded history, with the last major eruption in 2001 shooting ash nearly 10km above the volcano
