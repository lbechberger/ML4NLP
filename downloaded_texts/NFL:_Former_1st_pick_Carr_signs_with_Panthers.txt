David Carr, the first pick in Houston Texans history, and the first overall pick of the 2002 NFL Draft was signed Friday by the Carolina Panthers. Carr will serve as backup to current starter Jake Delhomme.

Carr, a five-year starting quarterback for the Texans, completed 60 percent of his passes, but threw 65 interceptions and was sacked 249 times. He completed 68.3 percent of his passes last season, a career high. Carr was sacked 249 times in the past five seasons with the Texans, and was released by the organization after they made a trade with the Atlanta Falcons to acquire Matt Schaub, who had served as the backup quarterback to Michael Vick.

The Panthers were in need of a quality backup quarterback after releasing seven-year veteran Chris Weinke in March. Weinke had struggled last season, leading the team to a 1-2 record during an injury to Delhomme. 

The move means the Panthers now have the top two picks from the 2002 draft. Carolina selected defensive end Julius Peppers with No. 2 pick. The Panthers have not done much outside of the Carr deal this off-season, with 21 of last season's 22 starting players returning to the team.
