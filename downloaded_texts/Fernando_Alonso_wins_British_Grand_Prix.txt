Fernando Alonso for the first time in his career won the FIA Formula-1 British Grand Prix at the Silverstone Circuit. 

Alonso was in the lead for the most of the race. Michael Schumacher started third, but finished before Kimi Raikkonen. Alonso teammate Giancarlo Fisicella beat Felipe Massa on the second pit stop and finished on the back of Raikkonen.

Bad luck for Jenson Button, ruefull race for English fans.
