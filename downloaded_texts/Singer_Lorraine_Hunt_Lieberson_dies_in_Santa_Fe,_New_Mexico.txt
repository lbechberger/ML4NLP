Lorraine Hunt Lieberson, an American mezzo soprano singer, died Monday morning at her home in Santa Fe, New Mexico. Lieberson, 52, died after a bout with terminal cancer, according to Richard Gaddes, general director of the Santa Fe Opera.

Lieberson was born in San Francisco where her father conducted community opera productions. She began her musical career as a violinist. 

Lieberson avoided the standard operatic repertoire, preferring instead to perform early (pre-1750) music and contemporary works. Particularly respected for her musicianship, she was focused on music and art, rather than on cultivating celebrity. 

Two weeks ago, Lieberson canceled all of her remaining 2006 performances. Lieberson's younger sister Alexis died of breast cancer in 2000, the same year the singer herself was diagnosed with breast cancer.

She is survived by her husband, mother, father, brother, and sister.
