Liberal MP Borys Wrzesnewskyj has resigned after an uproar over his comments suggesting that Canada should negotiate directly with Lebanon's Hezbollah, which is on Canada's list of terrorist organizations. In response to the statement by Wrzesnewskyj, Liberal leadership hopefuls Scott Brison and Carolyn Bennett had immediately demanded Wrzesnewskyj step down from his post, saying that his comments were unacceptable.

"His comments, which were not representative of the Liberal party, caused a lot of concern," said Liberal MP Keith Martin.

Tory MP Jason Kenney, was calling his comments nothing short of a sign of support for terrorist groups. "Their idea of a balanced approach is one where Israel is always wrong," said Kenney. "This represents a totally irresponsible approach to foreign security policy."

Wrzesnewskyj denied media reports about him claiming that he wants Hezbollah taken off Ottawa's official list of terrorist organizations.

"I've said all along that Hezbollah is a terrorist organization and will continue to be," Wrzesnewskyj said.

Wrzesnewskyj resigned on Wednesday and interim Liberal Leader Bill Graham said his resignation was accepted.
