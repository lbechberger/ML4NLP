A 19-year-old man has been killed and a 22-year-old man seriously injured as the result of a double shooting incident in Lower Clapton, a district in the east of the British capital London. The Metropolitan Police (MPS) reported the incident taking place on Hindrey Road in Lower Clapton at 2020 UTC Saturday.

Police have not formally identified the younger victim but believe he was Joseph Burke-Monerville. The identity of the older victim has not been reported.

Another 19-year-old man was sitting in a parked car with the two victims at the time of the incident. He was uninjured.

After both victims were hospitalised, Burke-Monerville died a few hours after. A post-mortem is expected. According to police the 22-year-old's condition in hospital is stable though serious.

The MPS, which is appealing for eyewitnesses to the incident, has yet to arrest any suspects and said it does not know what motivated the shootings. A spokesperson for the police said: "At this very early stage we must retain an open mind regarding the circumstances of the incident and any motive."

Operation Trident detectives understand two persons were sighted running from the crime scene towards the neighbouring Pembury Estate and are now searching for them. One is described as having light skin similar to that of a Turkish or Asian person and the other suspect is said to be black.
