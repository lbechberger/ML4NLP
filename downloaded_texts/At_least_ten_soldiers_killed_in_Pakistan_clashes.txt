At least ten Pakistani soldiers have been killed in two incidents near the border with Afghanistan, the country's military said on Wednesday.

Pakistani officials reported that at least eight paramilitary soldiers died in a landmine explosion in the northwestern Mohmand tribal region. Separately, authorities said two soldiers were killed in clashes with militants in the same region, and at least eight soldiers are missing. Officials added ten suspected militants were killed after military attack helicopters shelled their hideouts.

The incidents took place a day after a suicide bomber rammed his explosives-laden car into a crowded market in northwestern Pakistan, killing about 30 people and wounding dozens. This comes as Pakistani armed forces are continuing an offensive against Taliban members in the South Waziristan region of the country.
