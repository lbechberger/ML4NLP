Scott David Dover, 45, a father of two young boys in Cedar City, Utah, was arrested on Thursday and charges against the father could be filed today.

Police say he used electric dog collars to discipline his children. Conviction could result in up to 15 years in prison. Dover is being held in Iron County Jail; bail was set at ten thousand dollars.

Police Sgt. Jerry Womack said that the boys, both about six years old, did not have any burns or marks on them and that it was not known whether the collars had ever been placed around their necks. He also said, however, that Dover admitted to using the collars on his sons.

"It sounds bad, but it actually administers a mild shock. He just felt that was an option for discipline. We disagree vehemently," said Womack.

Cedar City Police were contacted on Wednesday by the Department of Child and Family Services.

"The kids are OK. Try to always remember that this child needs guidance, protection and someone to show them the way. To us, discipline means guidance, working with children on their strengths or showing them that some things could be done differently," said Carol Sisco, spokeswoman for the Utah Department of Human Services.

The "shock-collars" emit small electrical currents and are used for training dogs.

So far, the mother has not been charged. Latest reports said the boys were still living with her. Police are still deciding whether to file charges against her.
