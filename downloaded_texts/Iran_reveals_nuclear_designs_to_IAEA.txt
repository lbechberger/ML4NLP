According to reports, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has received copies of documents detailing the nuclear designs for Iran's nuclear program. Its is reported that some of those designs could be used to produce a nuclear bomb.

According to the reports, within the documents are instructions on how to "cast uranium metal" into the shape of a warhead, which are often used on nuclear bombs.

Iran does not deny the documents existence, but said that it received the documents during times when they bought nuclear material on the black market, without being asked if they wanted them or not.

The IAEA, which came across the documents when investigating the nuclear activities of Iran, first asked for the information and designs in 2005. Iranian officials say that IAEA inspectors are permitted to go to Tehran to view the original document. They had previously denied the IAEA a copy or examination of the document.
