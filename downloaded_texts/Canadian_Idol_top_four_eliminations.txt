After the results were revealed, Mulroney thanked Doucette: "I am so glad you decided to come back and audition this year," he said. "If there is anything you have shown us in your run to Top 4 is how memorable you are."

"I don't know if I was as confident in what I wanted to do before I started this competition, but now I am absolutely positive I want to be a musician," Doucette said. "You guys showed me that it's alright to be unique. Thank you!"

"You've got a unique voice, which means you have to sing your own words," Jake Gold advised him after the results were announced. "Keep doing what you're doing and write songs."
