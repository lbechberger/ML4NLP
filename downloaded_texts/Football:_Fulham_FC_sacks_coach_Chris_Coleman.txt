Fulham FC coach Chris Coleman was sacked Tuesday, the day after a disappointing 3-1 loss to Manchester City. 

Fulham's form has been poor as of late, with the team not winning in their past seven games. The Easter weekend was especially harsh for the Cottagers, as they leaked seven goals, only scoring two themselves in games against Everton and Manchester City. The drop in form has put Fulham dangerously near relegation, and with the bottom teams currently stepping up their form, Fulham management decided it was time for a change.

Assistant coach Steve Kean has also been released from the club, and Fulham has made an agreement with the Irish FA for Northern Ireland boss Lawrie Sanchez to take control of the team in a caretaker position for the remainder of the season.

Coleman has been with Fulham for ten years, four as the manager. He coached the team for 176 games, winning 61, drawing 44, and loosing 71. 

Sanchez's first match in charge will come against Reading on the 14th of April. Other games remaining in the season for Fulham include matches against Arsenal and Liverpool.
