By a majority of 378 to 262, Members of the European Parliament have voted to abolish the right of European Union countries to opt out of Working Time Directive. If the Council of Ministers agrees, the right to opt out of the directive will be phased out over a period of three years.

Under the "derogation" provision of the directive, individual workers can waive the right to work no more than 48 hours per week. Among the member states, only the United Kingdom uses this provision.
