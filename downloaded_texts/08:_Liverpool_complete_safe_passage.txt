Liverpool went into Tuesday's game knowing they would struggle if they conceded. Liverpool were without Jamie Carragher or Steven Gerrard due to injury but managed an easy win at home to Toulouse.

Peter Crouch put Liverpool 1-0 up after 18 minutes with a header scored from a Dirk Kuyt cross. From here, Liverpool dominated the game. Sami HyypiÃ¤ scored the second goal with a header from a Yossi Benayoun corner.

In the second half Kuyt was denied by the crossbar after his shot had taken a touch off Mauro Cetto but he got his first goal of the season on the 87 minute mark after a fine one-two with substitute, and Dutch compatriot, Ryan Babel. Kuyt then scored his second, and Liverpool's fourth, with the last touch of the game from a Benayoun assist.
