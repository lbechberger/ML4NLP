In British Columbia, Canada, leadership debates during provincial elections can have a major effect. In 1991, a single sentence during the leadership debate catapulted the then-obscure B.C. Liberal party from no seats for more than a decade to official opposition with 17 seats. In the current election, three television stations plan to broadcast the event live.

Adriane Carr of the Greens, Carole James of the New Democratic Party (NDP) and Gordon Campbell of the B.C. Liberals left the campaign trail on Monday to prepare for the Leadership debate on Tuesday night. The contestants were heavily prepared, and came into the debate with talking points and notes carefully memorized and at the ready.
