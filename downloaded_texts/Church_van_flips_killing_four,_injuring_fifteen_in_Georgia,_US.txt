A 1987 Dodge Ram Wagon van registered to the Tabernacle of Deliverance and Prayer flipped over on a highway in southwest Georgia yesterday killing four and injuring fifteen. The van, with nineteen passengers, was heading south on Highway 27 when a tire puncture caused the driver to lose control and crash into the median; it then rolled over several times at about 6:45 local time. 

According to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution at the time of the accident the van was overloaded and heading to Florida. The county coroner declined to reveal the age and names of the victims, but it is believed that children were among the passengers and the pastor of the church has been confirmed as one of the fatalities. Two teenagers — a boy of nineteen and a girl of thirteen — are among the dead.

Police officers examined the wreckage in situ. The severity of the injuries sustained is unknown, but it is reported that all fifteen survivors were taken to hospital, with some requiring an airlift.
