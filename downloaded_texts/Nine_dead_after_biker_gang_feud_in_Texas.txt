Nine people are dead and eighteen injured after a shootout among alleged rival biker gangs broke out inside a sports bar in Texas yesterday . 

The violence erupted at Twin Peaks Sports Bar and Grill inside a shopping mall in Waco. The fight which included up to five biker gangs quickly escalated, resulting in a gunfire battle across two car parks. Waco Sergeant Patrick Swanton said an argument about a parking spot may have sparked the fight.

Restaurant customers said they waited out the fight with staff locked in a freezer room. Swanton said all but one of the deaths occurred at the scene, with the ninth in hospital.

Swanton said, "This is probably one of the most gruesome crime scenes I've ever seen in my 34 years of law enforcement", and, "I was amazed that we didn't have innocent civilians killed or injured."

Police officers were present and quick to intervene when the shooting broke out as they knew beforehand of a planned meeting.
