Several suspect packages were found in the Shepherds Bush area of West London this morning, which led to many roads in the area being closed, along with the Hammersmith and City tube line.

The area re-opened shortly afterwards, after Bomb Squad experts determined the packages were safe, and a woman walked into Hammersmith Police Station and admitted placing the packages as "works of art".

Police are still advising motorists to avoid the area, due to heavy traffic.
