A fire which broke out onboard a Greek oil tanker in the port of Tema, Ghana at 9am Friday (local time), now threatens an oil refinery. The chief of Ghana's Port Authority, Ben Awusu-Mensah, said 80 firemen are currently fighting the blaze. "The situation is extremely critical" he said, "they're trying to harness the flames, but there are fears they might catch the refinery".

At least three people have died. Authorities believe the toll will rise to eleven. "We've brought out two more bodies today and we've seen between six and nine more but it is very dark and hot in there," said one firefighter.
