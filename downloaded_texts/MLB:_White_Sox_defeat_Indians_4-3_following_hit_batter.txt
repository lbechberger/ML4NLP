It was an unusual ending to Thursday's game at U.S. Cellular Field between the Chicago White Sox and the Cleveland Indians. With the game tied in the bottom of the ninth inning, Cleveland pitcher Roberto HernÃ¡ndez hit batter A.J. Pierzynski with the bases loaded, walking in the winning run.

Grady Sizemore got things started for the Indians by hitting a solo home run in the first, but the Sox would tie it up in the second on a Paul Konerko RBI groundout. Another Indian homer came from the bat of Jason Michaels, but the Sox again tie it up in the fourth with Tadahito Iguchi hitting an RBI sacrifice fly. Chicago took their first lead of the game in the seventh with a Scott Podsednik RBI, but Jason Michaels would tie it up again in the eighth. In the bottom of the ninth inning, an inside pitch hit batter A.J. Pierzynski, walking in the winning run and ending the game.

Chicago starter Mark Buehrle left the game in the second inning suffering from bruising on his forearm after being hit just below the elbow of his pitching arm. He has been diagnosed with having a contusion on his left forearm, and his status will be day-to-day. Matt Thornton is credited a blown save for giving up Chicago's one run lead in the eighth. Cleveland starter Jeremy Sowers pitched the first six innings, giving up just a hit and two runs.

The White Sox, now 1-2, are staying in town to play the visiting Minnesota Twins while Cleveland, now 2-1, will go home to face off against the Seattle Mariners.
