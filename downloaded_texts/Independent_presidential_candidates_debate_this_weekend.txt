The city of Cincinnati, Ohio is host to 24 candidates for the what is arguably the world's top political office. As the United States presidential election draws nearer, the candidates meet to debate the issues with each other.

But you won't find anyone named Hillary or Barack on stage. You will find men named John, but they're Jon Greenspon, John Blyth, and John Bootie, not Republican favorite McCain.

This slate of diverse candidates gathering at the University of Cincinnati are the top independent candidates in the nation, those who have chosen to not attach themselves to one of the main parties. According to online encyclopedia Wikipedia, they "may hold a centrist viewpoint between the two parties [the Democrats and Republicans], they may hold an extremist viewpoint that goes beyond that of either major parties, or they may have a viewpoint based on issues that they don't feel either party addresses."

Dubbed as the "single most exciting political event of 2008", it's the first of at least two national gatherings for these often overlooked candidates, the next being in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania on May 3 and 4, 2008.



Wikinews will be reporting from this event, with two volunteer freelance photographers taking pictures of the debates and candidates.
