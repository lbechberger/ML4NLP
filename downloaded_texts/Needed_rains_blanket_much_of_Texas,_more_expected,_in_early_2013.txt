Rain fell continuously along a large swathe of the eastern part of Texas on Tuesday and Wednesday, and is predicted to continue through much of today , according to media sources. Experts predict 3–5 inches of rain will fall in the area. The city of Tyler received just under 35 inches of rainfall in 2012, about 11 inches less than usual for a one-year period.

A meteorologist with the National Weather Service noted the rainfall is a positive sign for 2013 considering the state's limited rain over the past three years. 2011 and 2012 were extreme drought years for the state. In July 2011, the state saw less than 1 inch of rainfall for the entire month.

In 2010–11, the state saw the worst drought year in an over 100-year recorded period. Many farmers and ranchers experienced devastating losses of livestock and crops. Significant drought conditions returned again during Summer 2012.
