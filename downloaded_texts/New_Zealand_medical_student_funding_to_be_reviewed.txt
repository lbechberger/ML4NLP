The New Zealand government has announced that it will be reviewing funding for medical and dentistry students at Otago and Auckland Universities to certify the institutions' standards and help staff retention.

The dean of Auckland University's Faculty of Medical and Health Sciences, Professor Iain Martin says the review “can’t come soon enough”.

The Medical Students Association welcomes the review. It says that it has been worried about student debt for years "High debt encourages too many graduates overseas, or into high paying areas of practice at the expense of areas like general practice"
