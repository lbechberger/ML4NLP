Flight Lieutenant Malcolm Kendall-Smith, a New Zealand born RAF medical officer based at Kinloss in Scotland, faces a court martial on four counts of disobeying a lawful command.

It has been reported that the charges will be defended on the basis that an officer is justified in refusing to obey commands if they are illegal and that the invasion of Iraq was an illegal act.

No date has yet been set for the court martial.
