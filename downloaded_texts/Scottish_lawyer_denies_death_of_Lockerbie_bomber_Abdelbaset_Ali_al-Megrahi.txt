A Scottish lawyer today denied reports that Lockerbie bomber Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed Al Megrahi had died, after it was reported on Sky News earlier today that "unidentified sources" had said that he was dead.

The reports came onto Sky News at around 16.00 BST today. The information could not be confirmed, and it was not immediately clear where Sky News had obtained their information. Megrahi is suffering from terminal prostate cancer. Scottish Cabinet Secretary for Justice Kenny MacAskill MSP decided on 20 August 2009 to grant Megrahi compassionate release from Greenock Prison in Glasgow, Scotland and to allow him to return to Libya, after medical advisers reported that he was likely to die in just three months.

On Wednesday, Megrahi's lawyer, Tony Kelly, responded to the claims made, saying that "it's absolutely untrue. He's definitely not dead. I'm not saying anything about his health condition other than the fact he is alive and breathing." He declined to release any information about Abdelbaset's current health condition. Following these comments, Sky News removed the information from their website.
