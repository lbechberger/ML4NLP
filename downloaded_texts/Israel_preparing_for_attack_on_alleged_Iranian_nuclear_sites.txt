The London Times has reported that, according to military sources, Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon has ordered Israel's armed forces to be prepared by the end of March for an attack on alleged secret uranium enrichment sites in Iran.

Israel has officially denied that it plans to attack Iran. However, Sharon warned, "Israel—and not only Israel—cannot accept a nuclear Iran. We have the ability to deal with this and we’re making all the necessary preparations to be ready for such a situation."

Israel is now at "G" readiness, which is the highest stage.

Israel's general election is on March 28, which coincides with the March deadline set by Sharon. Former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is currently the frontrunner to lead the Likud party, claimed that if Sharon does not attack "then when I form the new Israeli government, we’ll do what we did in the past against Saddam’s reactor, which gave us 20 years of tranquillity".

The uranium enrichment sites are said to be concealed in civilian locations.
