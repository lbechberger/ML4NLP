Five people are thought to be seriously injured after a coach carrying elderly people overturned near Norwich International Airport, Norwich, Norfolk, England. 44 others have suffered minor injuries.

Emergency services are reportedly at the scene, including at least seven ambulances. Norfolk Constabulary confirmed a "major incident" had occurred; it is thought only one vehicle, the single-decker coach, was involved. A statement released by the force said several people had become trapped in the vehicle in the incident, but all had been freed.

A spokesperson for Norfolk County Council said: "A major incident has been declared. At this stage there is nobody left at the scene [...] As far as we can tell at the moment there have been no fatalities." The spokesperson added those with serious injuries have been transported to Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital; others are being treated in a community centre near the site of the incident.

"I've seen four of five fire crews and at least seven ambulances going through to the scene of the crash, and they were still coming about an hour after the incident," reporter Cath Saunt, at the scene of the incident, said. "A couple of ambulances left the scene with blue flashing lights and people who do not need immediate treatment have been taken to a community centre."
