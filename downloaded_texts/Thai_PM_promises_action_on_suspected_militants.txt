According to local media reports there were at least three deaths as well as several people injured â€” some seriously. The casualties are said to consist of both insurgents and local villagers.

Despite strong words on the matter, the Prime Minister emphasized that, "the government will exercise most restraint and patience", and that the government's objective was to bring peace to the region.
