Eugene McCarthy, a Democratic Senator from Minnesota from 1959&amp;ndasp;1971, has died at the age of 89 in Washington, D.C., his son announced.

McCarthy ran for President of the United States a total of five times, the latest in the 1992 US Presidential Election. In 1968 he ran against incumbent Lyndon B. Johnson, who later withdrew his bid for a second term (Johnson was inaugurated following the assassination of John F. Kennedy, and later won the presidential bid for 1964).

"He was thoughtful and he was principled and he was compassionate and he had a good sense of humor," his son said.
