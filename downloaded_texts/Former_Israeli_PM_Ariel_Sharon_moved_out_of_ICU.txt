Former Prime Minister of Israel, Ariel Sharon, 78, has been moved out of the intensive care unit at Sheba Medical Center after his condition "improved."

"[There has been] noticeable improvement in his kidney function and the pneumonia in his lungs," said David Weinberg, a spokesman for the medical center.

Sharon's condition is still being called "serious" and he is still being held in the care department for respiratory functions.

Sharon suffered a major stroke in January and has been in a coma since then. On August 14, Sharon was admitted to ICU when he developed pneumonia.
