Five South Korean workers have been kidnapped from a natural gas facility operated by Shell Petroleum Development Company in the Nigerian Delta. 

A group called the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta is claiming responsibility for the attack and kidnappings and says that one kidnapper and at least six Nigerian soldiers were killed on a Nigerian military boat, when gunmen entered the facility. The group's main demand is the release of a jailed militia leader, Mujahid Dokubo-Asari.

"[The Korean workers] are in good health and have been returned to one of our bases. As long as the units holding these individuals do not come under attack, no harm will come to the prisoners. We do not kill those fortunate to be captured by our fighters," said the group.

The group also says that they "plan more attacks" on facilities and oil rigs in the near future.

"In the next few weeks our attacks will increase with the destruction of several facilities of crucial importance to the oil industry," said the group.

One of the kidnapped victims is identified as Park Chang-am. 

"I want Dad to come back so we can go fishing," said the son of Chang-am, Park Myong-il.
