According to Iranian state run media, current Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has won re-election by a margin of 2 to 1.

According to the reports, the country's interior minister says Ahmadinejad won with 66% of the votes counted so far in the nation's election on Friday. Approximately 33 million votes have been tallied.

One of Ahmadinejad opponents Mir Hossein Mousavi, had earlier declared himself "definitely" the winner and said he may dispute the results. So far Mousavi has only 31% of votes.

At present, there are unconfirmed reports that Mir Hossein Mousavi may have been detained by "members of the intelligence community". In addition, there are unconfirmed reports that Mousavi's Tehran campaign headquarters was surrounded by the intelligence service as well.

Mousavi's supporters have taken to the streets of Tehran to protest the election results.
