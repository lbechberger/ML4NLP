Mixed martial arts fighter Alex Reid, nicknamed "The Reidenator", has been voted the winner of UK Celebrity Big Brother 2010. He won what is the last series of the programme in the final on Friday night, having received 65.9% of the votes from the public.

Musician Dane Bowers finished in second place, while Vinnie Jones, a former British soccer player and now a film actor, came in third place. After his departure from the Big Brother house, he commented about Alex: "I taught him everything I know." Vinnie had become unpopular with fans as he was said to have been bossy to other celebrities inside the house. Speaking to presenter Davina McCall, he stated: "I was just trying to keep order in the house because a lot of people were selfish. I was just trying to keep some stability in the house."

Musician Jonas Altberg, better known by his stage name Basshunter, finished in fourth place. Actress Stephanie Beacham left the Big Brother house in fifth place.

Alex Reid has been the girlfriend to former glamour model Katie Price since July 2009. Fellow housemate Dane has also previously been Katie's boyfriend. When Davina McCall mentioned Price during the interview with Alex, the crowd gave out a negative reaction of booing. In response, he said: "Come on guys, don't do that. I'm sorry guys... I'm not sorry, I really love Katie Price."

During the interview with Davina McCall, Alex commented about his victory. He said: "What an amazing, fantastic start to a new year. Vinnie has been very inspirational to me. He's transitioned from athletic to actor, which is what I want to do. I'm not getting booed now. That's amazing... I'm speechless. My whole agenda in here was to be myself." Alex also spoke of contestant Dane. "I was surprised by what a cool dude he is. I'm really looking forward to seeing more of Dane," Alex said.
