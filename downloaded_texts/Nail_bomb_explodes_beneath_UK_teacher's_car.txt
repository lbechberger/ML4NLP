A nail bomb has exploded under a car, thought to belong to a teacher, at least ten meters from the entrance of St. Edward's College in Liverpool, England at approximately 14.50 BST. There were no injuries, but the car was severely damaged in the blast.

Merseyside Police confirmed that officers were investigating a security alert at the college which is an independent Catholic boys and girls school for children ages 11-18. They also confirmed that it was "some kind of explosive device" which was involved.

"There was an explosion under a car at the school this afternoon. What caused the explosion and the reasons behind it we are investigating. Nobody has been injured and there has been no collateral damage," said Michael O'Callaghan, an Inspector for the Scotland Yard. Other reports say that the bomb was inside the car.

Police believe that the bomb was timed to detonate at the time children were being let out of school for the day. Almost 2,000 students attend the school, which was evacuated after the blast.
