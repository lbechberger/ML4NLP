Two people, a nine year old boy and a 23-year-old woman from Jakarta in Indonesia, have died from the H5N1 Avian Flu virus marking the country's 100th death from the disease. Both died on Sunday, January 27.

"The woman died yesterday, but we just received the results that she's positive with bird flu. The total number of deaths is now 100 out of 124 positive cases," said National Bird Flu Center spokesman, Joko Suyono.

Nearly half of all humans that died from H5N1, have been from Indonesia. Nearly half of those infected in the country received the virus from poultry that was contaminated with the virus.

So far, 223 people from 13 different nations around the world have died from H5N1.
