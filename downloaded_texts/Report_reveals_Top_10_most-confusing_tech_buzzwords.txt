The California-based Engligh language tracker, Global Language Monitor, released its 2005 list of most confusing - yet frequently cited - high tech buzzwords to be "HTTP," "Voice Over IP" (VoIP), and "Megapixel." Closely following were "Plasma," "Robust," "WORM" and "Emoticon." 

In early March, the group used a predictive index computer algorithm to track specific words and phrases in the media and on the Internet. They were tracked in relation to frequency, contextual usage and appearance in global media outlets.

The Global Language Monitor claims to analyze and catalogue trends in word usage and word choices, focusing on the linguistic impact on various cultures. The GLM says it relies upon a global network of volunteer linguists, professional wordsmiths and other bibliophiles to monitor the trends in the evolution and demise of world languages.
