US Vice President Joe Biden's son Beau died of brain cancer on Saturday. He was 46.

After being diagnosed less than two years ago, Beau underwent treatment and was considered recovered, but was recently admitted to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland due to return of the cancer.

Biden released a statement through the White House. Noting the family was with Beau when he died, he said, "It is with broken hearts that Hallie, Hunter, Ashley, Jill and I announce the passing of our husband, brother and son, Beau, after he battled brain cancer with the same integrity, courage and strength he demonstrated every day of his life."

President Barack Obama and the first lady Michelle Obama cancelled a scheduled White House reception to visit the Biden family and give their condolences. 

The Obamas released a statement not long after receiving the news that states, â€œMichelle and I are grieving. Beau Biden was a friend of ours. His beloved family [...] are friends of ours. And Joe and Jill Biden are as good as friends get."
