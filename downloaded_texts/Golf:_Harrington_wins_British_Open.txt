With a score that is three over par, defending champion Padraig Harrington has won the British Open, which took place this year in Southport, England. Ian Poulter fell back to second place after experiencing a short period of time in joint first place.

Greg Norman, who finished in third place, would have been the oldest person ever to win British Open if he finished in first place.

Before today, Padraig Harrington had already had 22 wins as a professional and four as an amateur. His wins include last year's British Open. The total prize purse for this year was US$8,600,000, of which the winner got $1,500,000.
