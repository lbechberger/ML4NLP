Ex-Swiss Formula One driver Clay Regazzoni has died after being involved in a road accident with a lorry. He was sixty seven.

Regazzoni was victorious five times during his F1 career, most notably his last win at the 1979 British Grand Prix where he won the first of over 100 wins for the Williams team. 

His career ended in 1980 after crashing his Ensign during the United States Grand Prix West due to a brake failure. The crash left the Swiss paralyzed from the waist down.

Williams team owner Frank Williams, described Regazzoni as "gentleman" and "a pleasure to have with us in the team".

Regazzoni was also famous for his moustache and his relaxed personality.
