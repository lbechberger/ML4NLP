Organisers of the Targa West Tarmac Rally have confirmed the death of Australian motor sport legend Peter Brock, 61, as reported on Australian Media.

Brock died after his Daytona Coupe left the road and stuck a tree, shortly after 11:50AM today near the small town of Gidgengannup in Western Australia. His co-driver, Mick Hone was injured and taken to a nearby hospital for treatment.

Brock had admitted earlier in the day that he was "still coming to grips with the car" on radio. Spectators report seeing the rear of Brock's car sliding out as he negotiated a corner. They say he was going no faster than anyone else.

Race organisers and the Confederation of Australian Motorsport will conduct an investigation into the accident once the civil authorities have completed their investigation.

Brock was one of Australian motorsport's most significant figures, having won the Bathurst 1000 nine times. His death comes only days after the death of fellow Australian celebrity Steve Irwin.
