Tony Blair, leader of the ruling Labour party in the United Kingdom, won the first House of Commons test of his Education and Inspections Bill, but had to rely on support from the main opposition party, the Conservative party. The result has been seen as a blow to Mr Blair's authority.

The vote was 458 for, 115 against, a majority of 343. 52 Labour backbench Members of Parliament voted against the Bill, and another 25 did not vote.
