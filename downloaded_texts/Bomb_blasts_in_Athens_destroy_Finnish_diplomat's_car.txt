Three home made bombs exploded during the night in Athens, Greece. One of the bombs destroyed a Finnish diplomat's car. No one was injured in the bombings and a Greek group claiming to be anarchists has told local media that it committed the bombings as retaliation for the jailing of fellow anarchists. The Finnish Foreign Ministry has said that it believes it was an accident that Finnish diplomatic property was damaged - as all the evidence points to this -, and Finnish diplomats in Athens are said to be calm.
