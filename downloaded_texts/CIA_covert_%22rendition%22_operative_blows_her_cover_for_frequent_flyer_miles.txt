A December CIA report revealed several incidents of sloppy undercover work by agents. In one humorous series of incidents, a clandestine operative booked herself at foreign hotels under aliases, but insisted that frequent-flier miles earned at the hotels be credited to her personal frequent-flier account.

Other incidents detailed included cases of covert agents who failed to remove their cell phone batteries, making them vulnerable to electronic tracking even if the phone was off.
