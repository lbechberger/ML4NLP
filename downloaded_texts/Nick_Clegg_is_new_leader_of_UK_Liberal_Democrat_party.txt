Nick Clegg has came out first in the race to become the new leader of the Liberal Democrat Party, the third largest party in the United Kingdom.

Clegg congratulated Vincent Cable on his performance as acting leader of the Liberal Democrats, which he took after the resignation of Menzies Camp

He beat Chris Huhne in the party's election, although the number of votes was very close - Nick Clegg had just 511 more votes than Huhne.

During his acceptance speech he said "I want the Liberal Democrats to be the future of politics," and that he hoped his leadership of the Liberal Democrats would be about ambition and change. He also acknowledged that it was a close contest. His acceptance speech took place in a central London hotel. 

In his speech he also criticized the Labour and Conservative parties by saying they were mutating in to one party and encouraged unsatisfied voters to vote for the Liberal Democrats.
