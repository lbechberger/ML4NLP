The Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology said that on Friday at 10:18 a.m., Volcano Bulusan erupted for about 6-minutes, releasing ash one kilometer into the air. The institute has issued an Alert Level 1, advising people from entering the permanent danger zone extending for four-kilometers around the volcano.

The Institute said that for a period of 24 hours before the volcano exploded, their seismic instruments had acquired 38 high frequency and 2 low frequency earthquakes at the volcano. Due to a thick cloud cover, direct visual observation of the volcano was not possible.
