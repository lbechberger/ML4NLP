The new Ukranian president Viktor Yushchenko was today sworn into office in Kiev's Independence Square, drawing a line under a bitter dispute between him and opposition candidate Viktor Yanukovych. Taking the oath of office, Yushchenko added "This is a victory of freedom over tyranny. The victory of law over lawlessness."

Opposition candidate and Russian backed Viktor Yanukovych has challenged the validity of the election rerun on December 26 2004, which saw his victory overruled. As recently as a few days ago, the Supreme Court overruled a final request to delay the ceremony. Mr Yanukovych has stated that he will take his battle to the European Court of Human Rights.

In a ceremony watched by eight heads of state, Viktor Yushchenko urged unity between sides and promised deeper integration into the European Union.
