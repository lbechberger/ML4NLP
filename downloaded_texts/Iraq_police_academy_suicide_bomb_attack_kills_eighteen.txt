A suicide bomb attack in the Iraqi capital Baghdad yesterday has killed at least eighteen people, all of whom were either police officers or cadets. Voice of America has cited the death toll as nineteen. At least 26 injuries have also been reported as a result of the incident.

According to police, the perpetrator detonated his car as police recruits exited the security barriers of a compound in the north-east of the city. A policeman informed Reuters of sighting "body parts scattered on the ground and boots and berets covered with blood" at the scene, as well as various vehicles burning.

As of yet, no group has accepted responsibility for the suicide bombing. However, Al-Qaeda characteristically uses attacks of this nature, according to The Daily Telegraph.

This attack is reportedly the deadliest in the country since 31 individuals were killed on January 27 as the result of a suicide bomb attack outside a Baghdad hospital, in which a vehicle filled with explosives was detonated.
