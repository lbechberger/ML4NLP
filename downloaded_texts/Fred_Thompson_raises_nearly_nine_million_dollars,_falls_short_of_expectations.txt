United States Presidential candidate Fred Thompson will report he raised just over US$8 million for his 2008 White House bid. However, this falls short of expectations when compared to rival Mitt Romney’s $21.2 million or Rudy Giuliani’s $16.6 million first quarter funds. Second tier candidate, Texas Representative Ron Paul, raised $1 million online in the last week after initially setting a goal of $500,000.

In contrast, Democratic frontrunners Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama's respective campaigns received $53 million and $59 million in the first half of the year. Both candidates are expected to have brought in "at least $17 million each in the third quarter."
