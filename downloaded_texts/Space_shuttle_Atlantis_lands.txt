Space Shuttle Atlantis has made a night landing at the Kennedy Space Center on Thursday finishing off STS-115 which lasted 13 days. The orbiter landed safely at 6:21:30 a.m. EDT, on runway 33 at KSC. The return of Atlantis to Earth avoided a traffic jam at the space station, as Soyuz TMA-9 Expedition 14 docked with the ISS on September 20, 2006 at 12:21AM CDT (09:21AM Moscow Time) which included space tourist Anousheh Ansari.
