2006 Tour de France champion Floyd Landis will be stripped of his title after test results revealed, Friday, the cyclist used synthetic testosterone during the competition.

Landis may also face a two year ban, even though he has repeatedly denied using any performance-enhancing drugs.

The final option that would salvage Landis' title is to file an appeal with the Court of Arbitration for Sport. He has one month to file the appeal.

If Landis is not able to save his title, he will be the first person in over 105 years to lose the title because of a drug charge.

U.S. Anti-Doping Agency CEO Travis Tygart said, "Today's ruling is a victory for all clean athletes and everyone who values fair and honest competition."

Landis said, "This ruling is a blow to athletes and cyclists everywhere...For the Panel to find in favor of USADA when, with respect to so many issues, USADA did not manage to prove even the most basic parts of their case shows that this system is fundamentally flawed. I am innocent, and we proved I am innocent."
