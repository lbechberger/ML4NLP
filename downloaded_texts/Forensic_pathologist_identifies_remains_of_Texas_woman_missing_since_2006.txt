The skeletal remains of Shunte Coleman, a missing person since 2006, have reportedly been found near the Angelina National Forest in the US state of Texas. On Friday, the San Augustine, Texas sherriff's department announced remains found in San Augustine by a forester earlier this year are a DNA match for Coleman.

A forensic anthropologist from Sam Houston State University assisted with the investigation and determined the findings matched Jacksonville resident Coleman.

In 2006 Coleman's family said the 26-year-old Shunte was likely dead. Connections were drawn between Coleman and Jacksonville Police Officer Larry Pugh, who was later sentenced in March 2007 to a twelve-year jail term for sex assault while on duty and retaliation against a witness. 

Frances Hicks, Coleman's sister, said, "She was loved. She wasn't just some nobody that nobody thought of. She was loved" "I think somewhere inside of us, we knew... but this is closure".

Police are yet to suggest a cause of death. 

Jacksonville Police Chief Reece Daniel stated on Friday, "We are making no comments or making any speculation because we are not going to impede any other agencyâ€™s investigation[...] We had a missing person's case that is now cleared, and we will cooperate with the agencies involved if they request our assistance."
