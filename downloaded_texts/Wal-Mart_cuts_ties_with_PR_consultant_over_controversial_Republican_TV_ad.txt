Wal-Mart severed links with Terry Nelson, a Republican strategist, last night because he had connections to a controversial Republican Party advertisement in Tennessee. The ad's purpose was to blast Democratic Senate candidate Harold Ford Jr, who is running against Republican Bob Corker.

A blonde woman in the ad says, "I met Harold at the Playboy party". As the spot ends, she winks and says breathily: "Harold, call me!". The ad also "criticised" Canada. "Canada can take care of North Korea," a man in the television ad says. "They're not busy."

Nelson and his company, CrossLink Strategy Group, were hired by Wal-Mart last year in an attempt to help the company.

Jesse Jackson, an American politician, and other leaders signed a letter distributed by WakeUpWal-Mart.com, asking the company to end its relationship with Nelson.

In an interview with the Associated Press Nelson said, "There was no intention to offend anybody and it's unfortunate if people took offense. That was certainly not what people planned for or hoped for."

A spokesman for Wal-Mart, David Tovar, issued a statement saying Nelson's company had "sent a letter to Wal-Mart ending its working relationship with our company."
