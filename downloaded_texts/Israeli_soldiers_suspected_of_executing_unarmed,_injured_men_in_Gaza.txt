Investigations by the Israeli Information Centre for Human Rights in the Occupied Territories, B'Tselem have suggested that Israeli soldiers shot dead two unarmed, wounded Palestinians in a town west of Jenin. 

Salim Abu al-Heijah and Mahmoud Abu Hassan had gone to a relative's home to seek shelter and medical aid. About 20 minutes later, Israeli troops ordered the men's family members to vacate the house, broke in, and allegedly executed the injured men, after stepping over them.

The Israeli military denied the allegations, saying "The force identified suspicious characters during a search of the area and opened fire towards them."

The B'Tselem report states that the fact that the Israeli soldiers did not attempt to tie up the deceased, or search the body following the killing, indicates that the soldiers did not perceive the victims as potential threats.
