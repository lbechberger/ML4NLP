England's qualification for UEFA Euro 2008 is in doubt after a 2-1 defeat to Russia.

Roman Pavlyuchenko scored two goals in the second half today, although both sides had their chances.

Russia had a penalty appeal turned down by the Spanish referee after eleven minutes, while Konstantin Zyrianov saw his drive pushed onto the goalposts by England's goalkeeper Paul Robinson. Needing to win on an artificial pitch in Moscow to be certain of qualification, England took the lead after 29 minutes when Wayne Rooney opened the scoring with a volley.

Both Steven Gerrard and Micah Richards missed chances to seal victory for England, and Russia equalised with a Roman Pavlyuchenko penalty after Wayne Rooney brought down Konstantin Zyrianov. England manager Steve McClaren said the penalty shot was a 'disgraceful' decision, as the offence appeared to have happened just outside the penalty area. Pavlyuchenko scored Russia's winner just four minutes later.

England have one match remaining against Group E leaders Croatia on November 21, but the defeat to Russia means that other results must go their way if they are to qualify for next year's tournament in Austria and Switzerland. Russia will qualify ahead of England if they defeat both Israel and Andorra in their final two matches.
