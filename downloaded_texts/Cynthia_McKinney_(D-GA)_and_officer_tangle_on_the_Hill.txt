U.S. Representative Cynthia McKinney (D-GA) allegedly punched a Capitol Hill police officer in the chest after he grabbed her arm. The officer was pursuing her after she failed to pass through the metal detector, which House Members are not required to do.

McKinney has complained about government security in the past. She protested about being stopped in 1993 and 1995. In 1996 and 1998, she complained that White House security didn't treat her the same as her white colleagues. At one time, a security officer mistook her 23-year-old white aide for the congresswoman. She is quoted on the Hill as having said, at one, "I am absolutely sick and tired of having to have my appearance at the White House validated by white people."

McKinney has been one of the most vocal critics of the 9/11 reviews and she hosted a July 22nd, 2005 Congressional Briefing: "The 9/11 Commission Report One Year Later: A Citizens' Response - Did They Get It Right?"
