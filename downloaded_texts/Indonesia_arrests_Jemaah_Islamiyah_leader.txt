Police in Indonesia say they have arrested Abu Dujana on Saturday on the island of Java. Dujana is alleged to be the military leader of Jemaah Islamiyah (JI) which stands accused of a number of attacks, including the 2002 Bali bombings.

The 38-year-old Dujana was Indonesia's most wanted fugitive. Police say it took days to identify him because of his many aliases. DNA and fingerprinting were both used to make the final confirmation.

"With this arrest we have successfully stopped acts of terrorism in the future," said police spokesperson Sisno Adiwinoto. "He was a key figure in the terrorist network in Indonesia."

Adiwinoto described Dujana as a field commander, a strategic planner and a bomb expert. "He was involved generally in the first Bali bombing, Poso and others." said the police spokesman.

Dujana is likely to be charged under anti-terrorism laws, and as such, could face the death penalty.
