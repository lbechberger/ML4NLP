In the wake of the season finale of MasterChef Australia, The Seven Network has announced that they shall be airing an "Aussie" remake of the Japanese cult classic Iron Chef.

Production starts in September in Melbourne, Victoria, with Neil Perry, Guy Grossi, and Guillaume Brahimi as the incumbent "Iron Chefs".

Grossi stated that Australians seem to be taking to the cooking show concept positively. Grossi also said that "if we can discover some great new talent along the way, all the better."

The Australian Iron Chef will take the traditional format of the Japanese version with contestants challenging the Iron Chefs to a cook-off using a secret ingredient each week, a spokesperson said. The dishes the Iron Chef and the contestants create will then be judged by a panel of food critics.

"The Iron Chef battle is not for amateurs or the faint-hearted â€” it is a cooking competition of Olympic proportions," the spokesperson continued.

As it stands, MasterChef Australia is the third most watched show in Australian history.
