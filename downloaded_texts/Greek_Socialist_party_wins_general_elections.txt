The Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK) of Greece has won the country's general elections, results have shown.


The former prime minister, Costas Karamanlis of the New Democracy party, had resigned his position after the results were announced, and congratulated PASOK's leader George Papandreou.


PASOK had 43,99% of the ballot, compared to the conservative New Democracy's 33,49%, with almost all of the votes counted. The socialists now have a 160-seat majority in the 300-seat parliament. New Democracy is projected to have won 91 seats.

"We stand here united before the great responsibility which we undertake," Papandreou told a crowd of supporters in Athens. His party had waged "a good fight to bring back hope and smile on Greeks' faces [...] to change the country's course into one of law, justice, solidarity, green development and progress," he said.

In order to win an absolute majority in the parliament, PASOK needs to control at least 43% of the seats.
