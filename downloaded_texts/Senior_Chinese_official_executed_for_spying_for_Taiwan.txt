A Chinese government official convicted of working for the Taiwanese government has been executed, and thousands of civil workers viewed the taped trial for "educational purposes" on Monday. The prisoner's name was Tong Daning and was in his mid-50's and held a rank just under "Assistant-Minister" before he was found guilty of espionage. According to the anonymous sources, Daning had been selling state sources for over 15 years, making a profit of about US$250,000. 

Daning is the highest ranking person executed in China since 1999, when a Major General and Senior Colonel were executed for selling state secrets. China and Taiwan have been spying on each other ever since 1949, when the People's Republic of China was officially created, but that has not stopped over 1 million Taiwanese citizens from working and investing over 100 billion USD in China. There have been many cases of espionage within the last few years, with all but two resulting in a death sentence.
