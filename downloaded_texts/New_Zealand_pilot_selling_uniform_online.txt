"Jeremy", an airplane pilot in Nelson, has put his uniform on sale for NZ$1.00 at New Zealand auction site TradeMe. The pilot had lost his job when Origin Pacific Airways fired 230 staff because of financial difficulties and is now trying to "make ends meet this week," the pilot said. The auction has already reached 31 bids and reached $101 as of 7.30 a.m. August 15.

'Jeremy', the pilot, said on the auction page, that he is offering "a rare piece of Kiwi aviation history,".

"This is an authentic Origin Pacific Jetstream pilot's uniform lovingly drycleaned for one last time before its unfortunate retirement. It's travelled many stormy nights and many sunrises and has seen almost 50,000 Kiwis safely to their destinations from Invercargill to the Far North. It has 778,000km on it, yet it looks as crisp today as it did when it was born," the pilot described on TradeMe.

One bidder had offered $40 if he sold the uniform immediately but that offer was turned down in order to see the auction go until Sunday. 

David Collier, Origin Pacific passenger services general manager, said "The uniform was Origin Pacific's property and the pilot should not be selling it, but I think it's probably one of those things you'd have to grin at and move on."

Jay, Waitakere, asked on the auction page if the uniform came with a plane. The pilot replied "No, but if you want to start an airline I know where you can find a great bunch of people."

The auction is closing on August 20, Sunday.
