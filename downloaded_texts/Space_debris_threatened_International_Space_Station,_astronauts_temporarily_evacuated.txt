The crew currently of the International Space Station (ISS) was briefly evacuated to the Russian Soyuz capsule in preparation for a possible impact with space debris. 

In memos published by NASAspaceflight.com, the object was described as "elliptical with a low perigee". It was unclear what kind of damage the debris would have caused if it had collided with the ISS. "Tracking of the small piece of debris/MMOD (Micrometeoroid Orbital Debris) was initially classed as a low threat of collision with the ISS. 

Universe Today reported the object as being large, while BNOnews said the object was small, about 0.009 meters.

At 12:34 EDT, "as a contingency, NASA’s Expedition 18 Commander Mike Fincke, Russian Flight Engineer Yury Lonchakov, and NASA’s Sandra Magnus were asked to 'evacuate' into the Russian Soyuz, which would serve as their means of departing from the Station - should it be required," added NASA. 

Approximately 10 minutes later, after the threat had passed, the crew returned to its normal duties.
