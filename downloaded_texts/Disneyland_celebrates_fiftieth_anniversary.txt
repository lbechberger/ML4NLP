Today, The Walt Disney Company and thousands of guests celebrated the fiftieth birthday of theme park and American cultural landmark Disneyland.

Park guests, some of whom began queuing for entry around 3:00pm the previous day, packed into the park bringing it to full capacity before lunchtime.

Arnold Schwarzanegger, Julie Andrews, Art Linkletter, Diane Disney-Miller, Disney CEO Michael Eisner and Disney CEO-elect, president and COO Bob Iger all joined in the festivities, with Disney-Miller, the eldest daughter of park founder Walt Disney, reading her father's original dedication at the precise time it was first read.

The park kicked off the official festivities on May 5 with the opening of the Happiest Homecoming on Earth.
