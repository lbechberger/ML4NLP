The Taj Mahal, one of India's most famed monuments, has been gradually yellowing due to air pollution, authorities say.

Plans are afoot to give the white marble structure a mud bath - the mud will absorb the dirt already accumulated as it dries and is then washed off. The cost has been assessed at US$230,000, and will need to be repeated every two to three years.

Roughly 3,000,000 tourists visit the monument every year, and visitors are required to park 2 miles away from the monument in an effort to reduce pollution around the area.
