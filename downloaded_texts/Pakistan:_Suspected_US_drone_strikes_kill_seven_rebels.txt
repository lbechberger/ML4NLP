Security officials in Pakistan have stated that "[a]t least seven militants" have been killed by suspected US drone strikes. According to reports, US aircraft fired four missiles in North Waziristan, which killed seven or eight rebels and destroyed two cars parked outside a building.

An intelligence official informed AFP that at least seven militants were killed in the incident while three others were wounded. Two other officials from Miranshah confirmed the reports. The identities of those killed have not been confirmed. Officials said the area was a stronghold of a rebel group headed by Hafiz Gul Bahadur, which regularly attacks NATO officials in the country.

The first of the two attacks occurred when two missiles fired at a pair of cars beside a camp located near Mir Ali, North Waziristan, killed six people. The missiles destroyed a nearby compound as well as the vehicles according to officials. Officials added that two suspected rebels were killed by another drone which was fired near the bank of a river close to the camp. These were the ninth and tenth drone strikes carried out in the month of October. September had seen twenty one such strikes, which was the highest number of monthly airstrikes in Pakistan.
