Borussia Dortmund have hired JÃ¼rgen Klopp as their new Head Coach after Thomas Doll resignation after their worst league position in 20 years. Klopp's contract will run until the June 30, 2010. Klopp was the Head Coach for FSV Mainz since 2001 before leaving for Dortmund.

"I am delighted to be here. I am honoured", said Klopp. "Now I want to help bring the club back on track." Klopp has high expectations of the club, current players and target signings for the summer transfer window and wants to give the matches of Borussia Dortmund a "recognition factor."
