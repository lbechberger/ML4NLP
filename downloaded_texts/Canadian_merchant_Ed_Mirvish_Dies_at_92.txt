Noted Toronto resident and Canadian merchant and theatre owner Ed Mirvish has died. On July 11, 2007, the Mirvish family released a statement confirming his passing earlier that morning at St. Michaelâ€™s Hospital, Toronto. "Honest Ed", as he was known, was two weeks away from reaching his 93rd birthday.

"Mr. Mirvish did pass away this morning at around 1:30a.m. at St. Mike's Hospital," said his friend Russell Lazar.

The mayor of Toronto, David Miller, told CBC News that, "His store was about making sure that everyone could afford to live with some dignity and decency. His theatres were about bringing some joy and passion into people's lives."

Mirvish was known for his landmark discount store, Honest Ed's, and as a patron of the arts who helped revitalize the theatre scene in Toronto.
