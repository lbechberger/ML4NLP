Ahead of an upcoming election in the Canadian province of Quebec, the Parti libéral du Québec (Liberal Party of Quebec) are in the lead, well ahead of the separatist Parti Québécois (PQ), says a poll done by Montreal based newspaper Le Devoir.


The Liberals are at 37% support, 28% for the PQ, and 24% for the Action démocratique du Québec (ADQ) (Democratic Action of Quebec).

The Liberals, which form the current government in the province, could win again if they had a 6-point lead, says Jean-Marc Leger, president of Leger Marketing.

Quebecers were also asked who is leading the best campaign; 31% for Jean Charest, 25% Mario Dumont, and 14% for André Boisclair.

Jean Charest, the leader of the Quebec Liberals, wants Quebec to stay in Canada while the PQ, lead by André Boisclair, wants the province to separate completely. Mario Dumont, leader of the ADQ, also wants Quebec to stay in Canada. If the PQ were to win the election, a referendum on separation could be put to the people of the province, the results of which could form the basis of negotiation with Canada on sovereignty. 

However, more Quebecers want to stay in Canada then to separate. In a referendum, about 56% would say no to separation and 44% yes, according to the latest polls. The percentage of Quebecers wanting to separate from Canada has not changed markedly over time.

The official voting day is March 26.
