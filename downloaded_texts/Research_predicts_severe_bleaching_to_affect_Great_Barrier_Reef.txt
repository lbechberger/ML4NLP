One of the worst coral bleaching events in history is expected to affect over 38% of the Great Barrier reefs coral by early 2016. 

Research conducted by University of Queensland along with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration are suggesting that this coral bleaching, only the third of its kind, is due to rising ocean temperature. This rise in ocean temperature is in direct correlation to the El Niño weather pattern. 

Coral bleaching is a phenomenon that occurs when the algae that normally lives on the coral, and keeps it alive, is expelled due to stresses put onto the coral leaving the white skeleton of the coral behind. 

The Australian Bureau of Meteorology during the El Niño years we tend to see “warmer-than-average temperatures across most of southern Australia, particularly during the second half of the year. In general, decreased cloud cover results in warmer-than-average daytime temperatures, particularly in the spring and summer months. Higher temperatures exacerbate the effect of lower rainfall by increasing evaporative demand.”

They continue to explain that “El Niño events tend to begin in autumn, mature during winter and spring, then begin to decay in summer, with the event generally ending in the autumn of the following year. The greatest impact normally occurs during the winter/spring period”

When speaking to the Sydney Morning Herald Dr Tyrone Ridgway, from UQ's Global Change Institute explained “The severity of any impact on Australia's iconic Great Barrier Reef will depend on how long the higher-than-average ocean temperatures last. As we move into summer, these temperatures are expected to rise even more," he told Fairfax Media. If we get coral mortality, the health of the system will decline. As corals are the builders of the Reef, this would affect fish stocks as well as tourism
