On the morning of Monday, January 2, 2006, the 117th Tournament of Roses Rose Parade marched through Pasadena, California in only the tenth occurrence of rain on the morning of the parade. Fifty mile-an-hour winds buffeted the crowds of spectators for hours before and during the festivities.

Many spectators had purchased grandstand tickets for $50 or more only to find the aluminum benches cold and exposed to the winds. Umbrellas were ubiquitus though difficult to use effectively in the storm-like conditions. Virtually anyone present for more than an hour had a poncho of some sort. Those who partook in the traditional campout to claim free seating on the street often left only a single person to stoically wait out the storm until morning, most preferring to sleep in dryer conditions. Crowds were smaller than normal.

Vendors fared somewhat differently, depending on what they sold. Sales of hot food and drinks, umbrellas, ponchos, and tarps were up while sales of pre-packaged snacks and programs were down. Many street vendors left once sales or inventory dried up (figuritively speaking).
