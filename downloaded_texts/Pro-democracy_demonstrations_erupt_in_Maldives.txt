Pro-democracy demonstrations took place throughout the atoll nation of Maldives today, endangering the rule of authoritarian president Maumoon Abdul Gayoom. Reports indicated that the president was unable to approach the capital to take control.

The protestors, led by members of the newly-registered Maldivian Democratic Party, reportedly were demanding the release of political prisoners and the president's resignation. 

Gayoom has been president since 1978, and brooked little dissent during his tenure.
