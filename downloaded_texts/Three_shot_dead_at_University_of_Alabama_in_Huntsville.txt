Three people were killed and another was injured during a campus shooting at University of Alabama's Shelby Center for Science and Technology in Huntsville, Alabama.

Several other possible victims were soon rushed by ambulance to a nearby hospital. The surrounding area has since been cordoned off, and the entire university is currently under lockdown. 

"We have three confirmed people who are dead, one injured. The police have secured the building. The shooter is in custody," university spokesperson, Ray Garner, told local media on the scene. Mr. Garner also said the shooter was a female, but he could not identify her or any of the victims.
