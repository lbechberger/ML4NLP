A 29-year-old woman is dead after she fell from the roof of a University of Toronto building, apparently seeking ghosts.


The deceased, which some reports say was Leah Kubik, was exploring a building at 1 Spadina Crescent with a male companion around 2:00 a.m. (EDT). She attempted to make a jump from one section of the building to another and missed, resulting in a three-story fall into a courtyard below. Kubik was taken to St Michael's Hospital in Toronto where doctors pronounced her dead.

According to the Toronto Star, the pair had been drinking alcohol. Police initially said the two were hunting ghosts, but now say the two had finished a first date and were walking home when they decided to explore the building. An investigation is ongoing.

The building, built for Knox College in 1874, was purchased by the University 37 years ago.
