Ducks lead series 3-0. (Best of Seven)



The Minnesota Wild fell to the Anaheim Ducks on Sunday, putting their season in jeopardy. Anaheim needs only one win in any of the final four games to win the series and the right to move on to the Western Conference Semifinals. The Wild have been close in every game of the series, but have fell short each time.

Minnesota coach Jacques Lemaire said: "Everyone was saying, 'Shoot the puck! Shoot the puck!' on the bench and then they went back on the ice and they didn't shoot it," coach Jacques Lemaire said. "The guys recognized the mistakes we were making and couldn't adjust." 

Andy McDonald gave the Ducks the lead in the first, scoring on the power play to give the Ducks the early advantage. Ilya Bryzgalov would help the Ducks' cause, stopping 19 of 20 shots faced. Rob Niedermayer got his first goal of the postseason in the third period to double the Ducks' lead. Petteri Nummelin scored the only goal for the Wild with :39 remaining in regulation, which wouldn't be enough time to mount a comeback.

Sunday's loss beckoned in do or die time for the Wild, who must win Tuesday, when Minnesota will host the Anaheim Ducks. If the Wild cannot pick up a win in Tuesday's game, the series will be lost, as well as Minnesota's season.
