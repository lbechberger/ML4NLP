An anti-budget protest descended on Brisbane, Australia today in response to this past Tuesday's federal budget. Among the speakers at the pre-march rally were Australian Labor Party (ALP) senator Claire Moore and former Australian Democrats senator — and current Queensland Greens convenor — Andrew Bartlett.

Mr. Bartlett conveyed to the crowd that the Australian Greens would do everything in their power to block the budget legislation in parliament. Senator Moore was not heard stating similar of the ALP but spoke passionately against the budget.
