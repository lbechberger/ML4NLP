A German scientist has made the worldâ€™s smallest soccer pitch with nanotechnology. The pitch is so small that you could fit 20 000 on the tip of a human hair. 

The simulated soccer playing field measures 500 by 380 nanometres. It can only be seen under a special microscope. 

He spent a whole day engraving the lines with an electron beam.

"I am really, really proud," said Stefan Trellenkamp, nanotechnology researcher from the University of Kaiserslautern.

"The only problem is that I really don't know what to do with it. I can't put it on show as no one can see it," he said, "I guess it'll just stay in my drawer for the time being."
