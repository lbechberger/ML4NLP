Susan Torres, a woman who had been on life support because she is brain-dead, gave birth to a daughter by Caesarean section on Tuesday. The baby, Susan Anne Catherine Torres, weighs 1 pound, 13 ounces, and is 13 1/2 inches long.

The mother, Susan Torres, had a stroke on May 7 when the condition of her stage four melanoma went to her brain. Doctors said her brain functions had stopped and there was no hope of recovery.

Susan's husband, Jason Torres, asked that his wife be placed on artificial life support until their unborn child had a chance to develop and the baby could survive outside the mother's womb. Mrs. Torres was 17 weeks pregnant on May 7 when she was hospitalized for her condition. The fetus was in its 27th week of development when it was delivered. 

The baby reportedly "is doing well" and is in intensive care at the Virginia Hospital Center in Arlington County, Virginia. Mr. Torres, who quit his job to be at his wife's side, is faced with thousands in medical expenses. 

The mother died on Wednesday after being taken off life support. A fund has been set up for her at: The Susan M. Torres Fund
