The Rocket: The Maurice Richard Story was Canada's most-honoured film from 2006 at Tuesday's 27th Genie Awards in Toronto. The dramatisation of revered Montreal Canadiens ice hockey player Maurice Richard won in 9 of the 13 categories for which it was nominated.

The bilingual police-comedy Bon Cop, Bad Cop was 2006's most financially successful movie within Canada which earned it the Golden Reel Award. It also won the Best Picture category and a sound category, but was shut out of the rest of its ten nominated Genie categories.

The Genies are Canada's leading motion picture honours, conducted each year by the Academy of Canadian Cinema and Television.
