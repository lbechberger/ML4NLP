According to the Hannover Police Department, German international football goalkeeper Robert Enke died in the early evening yesterday. Enke had been crossing a railway at Neustadt-Eilvese and was killed by a train. Initial police investigations indicate suicide. The death of the 32-year-old soccer player from Hannover 96 has shocked the football world.

Enke's daughter died in 2006 when she just two years old. There is speculation that personal problems led to Enke's suicide.

Enke started his career in Jena and first represented his country in 1998 whilst playing for Borussia MÃ¶nchengladbach. He won eight full international caps for the German national team since 2007 and was part of the squad which finished as runners-up in UEFA Euro 2008. He was widely considered to be a strong contender for the number one spot at the 2010 World Cup.
