In an independent report released today, the National Audit Office has accused Learndirect and its administrators Ufi (University for Industry) of being 'too bureaucratic' in their administrative processes. They say that the administrative structure is too large, and should be streamlined. This should free more money to spend on students.

However, they have praised Learndirect, saying that they have 'pushed the boundaries of learning' in a short time frame.

Sir John Bourn, the Comptroller and Auditor General of the National Audit Office issued this statement:

"Learndirect is a major innovative feat that within a few short years has become the largest education provider of its type in the world. It is attracting large numbers of learners who otherwise would not have undertaken learning.

Management and administration costs have reduced with time but still take up too large a portion of the budget. They need to be streamlined so that more money can go into services for learners, and to increase the emphasis on small- and medium-sized businesses.â€�
