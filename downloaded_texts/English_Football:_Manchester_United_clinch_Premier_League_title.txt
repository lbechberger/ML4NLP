Manchester United needed just one point to clinch the Premier League title Saturday and a 0–0 draw with Arsenal gave them that point.

The title is United's 18th league title and 11th since the Premier League formed in 1992. The title is also United's third consecutive and marked the first time since the 1998–99 Treble winning season United clinched in front of a home crowd.

Both sides remained scoreless through 90 minutes, and with the draw, second-place Liverpool's hopes of the title were dashed. As the table currently stands, United have earned 87 points, while Liverpool have earned 80, with six being the maximum they can earn.

With two games remaining for both Liverpool and third-place Chelsea, both the second and third places are open, while Arsenal has locked up the fourth place spot.

Both sides had great chances, with the last coming to Arsenal captain Cesc Fàbregas, whose shot with three minutes to go banged off the crossbar.

United began the game on offense had a solid score chance inside of the first minute, but Darren Fletcher could not connect with Cristiano Ronaldo. Wayne Rooney also had a great chance in the first-half, while United's best chance of the second-half came on free kick from Ronaldo.

Arsenal pressed throughout most of the game, but solid defending by John O'Shea, Jonny Evans and Nemanja Vidić stopped several Arsenal chances and United keeper Edwin van der Sar collected the rest.

United gave Arsenal keeper Łukasz Fabiański little to do and Ronaldo's second-half free kick had Fabiański beat, but the ball travelled just wide.

Arsenal finishes up their season on May 24 with a game home against Stoke City. Manchester United finishes up their season away to Hull City on May 24.
