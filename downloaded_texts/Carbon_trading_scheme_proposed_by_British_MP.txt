The UK Environment Secretary, David Miliband proposed a carbon trading scheme for private citizens during the Audit Commission's annual lecture.

Under the scheme all individuals will receive equal carbon points and can trade electricity, gas, petrol and air travel for carbon points.

Mr. Miliband argues that the government could set limits on the amount of carbon emitted. He says that people with low income who contribute less to carbon emission could benefit by selling off excess carbon points. He also says that the scheme is more empowering than other forms of regulations such as banning particular products, services or activities, or taxing them heavily.

Chris Huhne, the Liberal Democrats' environment spokesman, “supported any discussion about household carbon allowances”. but also argues that that this would take too long to implement. He said that green taxes have fallen to their lowest since Margaret Thatcher was Prime Minster.
