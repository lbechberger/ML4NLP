While nearly all mainstream coverage of the 2008 Presidential election has focused on the Democratic and Republican candidates, the race for the White House also includes independents and third-party candidates. These prospects represent a variety of views that may not be acknowledged by the major party platforms.

Wikinews has reached out to these candidates throughout the campaign and now presents an interview with Donald K. Allen of Youngstown, Ohio, an independent presidential candidate who registered with the Federal Election Committee in January 2007. He says that his three major policies are "1. Take care of America and Americans first. 2. Turn our economy around. 3. Secure our borders."

Allen was previously interviewed by Wikinews, although the previous interview was only five questions long, and did not go into the candidate's policy in much detail. As a result, Wikinews has decided to do a more in depth interview, which is available below.
