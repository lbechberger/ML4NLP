Wikinews contacted Ryan, to talk about the issues facing Canadians, and what they and their party would do to address them. Wikinews is in the process of contacting every candidate, in every riding across the country, no matter their political stripe. All interviews are conducted over e-mail, and interviews are published unedited, allowing candidates to impart their full message to our readers, uninterrupted.

In 1996, the riding was created through the amalgamation of the Elgin—Norfolk, Lambton—Middlesex, and London—Middlesex ridings. While it was a Liberal riding for many years, through Jean Chretien's Parliamentary Secretary Gar Knutson, in 2004, the riding became Conservative, with Joe Preston taking its reigns. Besides Dolby and Preston, the riding's candidates include Liberal Suzanne van Bommel, Green Will Arlow, CAP Noel Burgon, CHP Carl Hiemstra, and independent Michael van Holst.
