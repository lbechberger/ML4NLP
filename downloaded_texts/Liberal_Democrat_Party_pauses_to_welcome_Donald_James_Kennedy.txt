One week into campaigning in the United Kingdom general election, the leader of the Liberal Democratic party, Charles Kennedy, has become a father. 

Kennedy's wife, Sarah, was taken to St Thomas' Hospital, London, yesterday, and Kennedy abandoned the election tour on the first day out to join her. Donald James Kennedy was born just after midnight. 

"Everything went tremendously smoothly," Kennedy explained to reporters. "This new Donald James Kennedy who becomes the latest addition to the clan is our pride and joy."
