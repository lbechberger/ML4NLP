Leader of New Zealand political party, New Zealand First and foreign minister, Winston Peters has claimed that he was in possession of the emails stolen from the head of the New Zealand National party, Doctor Don Brash. He now claims that his office has destroyed the emails due to mounting legal issues, including an injunction which prohibits the publication of the emails. This happened while Mr. Peters was away.

Dr. Brash said: "Mr. Peters has today admitted being in possession of stolen emails, but now claims that staff destroyed the emails when they found out a police inquiry was underway. And now Mr. Peters is asking the public to accept that he played no part in the decision to destroy this evidence. I find that hard to believe."

However Mr. Peters is claiming the he nor his party has anything to do with stealing the emails, Mr. Peters said: "...I understand the leaker has distributed the emails quite widely, and I can't be held responsible for anyone else's actions. What I can say is that when the police first became involved, a staff decision was made in my absence to destroy any emails we had."

Dr. Brash said: "This shows a serious lack of respect for the legal process by the office of one of our most senior law makers."

Mr. Peters said: "It is time National came clean. The public wants to know what the fuss is all about. If the emails are just about National Party organisation, then no-one will be interested, and New Zealand First has always been clear it would never use the personal stuff."

"[Mr. Peters is] saying that his staff didn't bother to consult him before destroying material that their leader had bragged about over a number of months. That is just incredible and Mr. Peters needs to come clean," Dr. Brash said.

The police investigation over who hacked into Dr. Brash's computer and stole his personal emails is still continuing. The court should be given the possession of any emails.
