Dermot Mannion has been named the new Chief Executive of Ireland's national carrier, Aer Lingus. Mr. Mannion, 47, will take up the post in August 2005.

Aer Lingus almost went bankrupt in 2002, but a major cost-cutting effort by former CEO Willie Walshe lead to a dramatic turnaround in the airline's fortunes, posting its largest ever profit in 2004. However, Willie Walshe left after a dispute with the government over privatization. He has since landed the top job at British Airways.

Mr. Mannion, an accountant, has extensive experience of aviation, having worked for the Dubai based airline Emirates since 1995. There he worked as Finance Director and later President of Group Support Services. He originally comes from County Sligo and is a graduate of Trinity College, Dublin.
