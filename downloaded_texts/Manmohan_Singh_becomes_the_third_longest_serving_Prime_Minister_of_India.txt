Manmohan Singh, the 14th and current Prime Minister of India, reached 2,273 days in office on Wednesday. He has emerged to become the third longest serving Prime Minister of India, replacing his predecessor Atal Bihari Vajpayee.

"There are no special celebrations for the day. The prime minister is following his routine schedule," said an official in the Prime Minister's office (PMO). "The main functions he celebrates related to his office are the anniversaries of the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government. They are all well publicised functions attended by UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and other leaders," the official added.

Singh's predecessor, Vajpayee, served as the Prime Minister for 13 days in 1996 and 2,256 days between the years 1998 and 2004. Jawaharlal Nehru, the first Prime Minister of independent India, leads the list with 6,130 days in the office, and his daughter, Indira Gandhi, stands second with 5,829 days.
