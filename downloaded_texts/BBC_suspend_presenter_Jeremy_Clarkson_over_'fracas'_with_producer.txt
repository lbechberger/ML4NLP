Jeremy Clarkson, one of the presenters on the BBC's motoring programme 'Top Gear' has been suspended by the corporation. Clarkson, responsible for several prior controversies, was suspended Tuesday, after allegedly 'punching' a producer last week. The next two episodes of 'Top Gear' have been pulled from broadcast, with a third — the season finale — also unlikely to be shown.

The incident leading to Clarkson's suspension reportedly occurred after an argument with a producer. After filming had finished in Newcastle, it is believed Clarkson, 54 punched 36-year-old producer Oisin Tymon over a lack of catering availability. The incident was reported to the BBC on Monday. A source spoke to the British newspaper The Daily Mirror about the incident. They said, "They came to the end of filming after a long day and Jeremy discovered that no food had been laid on. He just saw red and hit the assistant producer, who he blamed for not having organised the food. He snapped." 

However a source close to the suspended presenter defended him saying "he didn't punch anyone". 

The BBC released a short statement clarifying the situation. It said "Following a fracas with a BBC producer, Jeremy Clarkson has been suspended pending an investigation. No one else has been suspended. Top Gear will not be broadcast this Sunday. The BBC will be making no further comment at this time." 

Previously Clarkson had been given a "final warning" by BBC bosses over comments he had made. In 2014 it appeared that the presenter used a racist term while singing a nursery rhyme, he apologised after the incident came to light. He also caused offence with comments he made about India and Mexico as well as comments about people with special needs.

'Top Gear' is a motoring programme shown on BBC Two in the United Kingdom. Clarkson has presented the show since 2002, co-hosting alongside Richard Hammond and James May. He is one of the BBC's highest paid stars.
