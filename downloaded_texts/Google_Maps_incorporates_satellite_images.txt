Google Maps has incorporated 
satellite images
as a feature in their Beta Google Maps service. Now users can opt for a satellite image after they search for an address or driving directions, by clicking the satellite link at top left of the page. 

Satellite images are provided by Keyhole Corp. which was acquired by Google six months ago. Satellite images will be at least 6 months old. According to John Hanke, Keyhole's general manager, nobody will be able to read a license plate on a car from an image or see what an individual doing at the time it was taken.

Google Maps still only covers road maps in North America.
