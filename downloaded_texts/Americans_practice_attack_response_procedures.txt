In recent days, there has been a notable increase in nuclear attack drill activities in LA, Houston and the state of South Carolina.

Sources in the Houston Police Department have disclosed that they are running these nuclear disaster drills across the city of Houston, Texas.

"In the last week I have multi-checked with sources of mine in the Houston Police Department and confirmed that HPD has been running nuclear disaster drills," said Capt. Eric May, as he warned of a possible nuclear attack that might occur in the Texas City or Houston metro area. Capt. Eric May also mentioned that a likely target could be the British Petroleum plant in Texas City, Texas.

Local citizens have also noticed ongoing SWAT exercises involving numerous government agencies in the area, including Homeland Security, the HPD and the Pasadena Police Department.

"After leaving the Texas City police station, I noticed one thing really strange, as I counted at least 11 different types of official police and government vehicles parked in the police lot. I have never seen this before and it has me a little worried. What are they planning?" said local resident John Watkins.

Besides this increased activity in the Houston area, there have been reports that the Bank of America has been in contact with Homeland Security officials discussing the topic of how to deal with customers in the case of a pending "national disaster." Employees of the bank have been ordered to remain silent, as ones from all levels have been told of the proper procedures to take. Employees in both Houston and LA have disclosed they were recently told not to distribute certain things from safety deposit boxes in the event of a national emergency, including gold, silver and firearms. They were, however, allowed to hand out important papers to asking customers.

It seems as if British Petroleum may also be conducting nuclear disaster exercises in the Houston area, as an email from an alleged BP employee has surfaced on the internet. Although his identity has not been proven as of yet, he states that he holds the position of a "building monitor" and has never had any responsibilities before. However, on Friday, January 27th, he was called into a meeting and told that he had best get his men ready for some disaster drills to be starting in the next week.

The US government is also running a nuclear disaster drill in the Charleston, SC area from January 31st to February 2nd. The organizers said that nuclear drills should not frighten citizens, but should instead encourage them to learn how to protect themselves in the event of an attack. It should be noted that the government has run other nuclear disaster tests before, including one last summer called "Sudden Respond '05." Therefore, this increase of disaster drills may just indicate that the government is taking the threat of a nuclear attack seriously and not necessarily that there is one impending.
