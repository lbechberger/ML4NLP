According to the United States Geological Survey (USGS) a magnitude 4.2 earthquake with a depth of just under two miles, has struck California approximately 3 miles (5 kilometers) northeast of Wrightwood. The quake was reported at 1:53 a.m. (pacific time).

The USGS states that there could be some damage, but that it would likely be "very light," but so far the San Bernardino County Fire Department says that no damage has been reported.

There are no reports of any injuries, but witnesses say that they were awoken from their sleep as far away as Los Angeles.
