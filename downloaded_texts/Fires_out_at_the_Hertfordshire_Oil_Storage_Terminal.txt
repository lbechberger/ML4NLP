After two days, the 2005 Hertfordshire Oil Storage Terminal fire has finally been extinguished. 

The fires began after a series of explosions early on the morning of 11 December 2005. The terminal, known locally as the Buncefield Depot, is an oil storage facility located near Hemel Hempstead in Hertfordshire in the United Kingdom. These were some of the largest explosions ever to occur in the country and the incident has been described as the biggest of its kind in peacetime Europe. 

The Hertfordshire Fire Service chief Roy Wilsher said: "There are still some small bund (concrete container) fires, but the tanks are out." 

Fire crews would remain at the scene over the next few days cooling the area to ensure fires did not break out again, he said. 

A few residents are being allowed to return to their homes within an exclusion zone set up around the site.
