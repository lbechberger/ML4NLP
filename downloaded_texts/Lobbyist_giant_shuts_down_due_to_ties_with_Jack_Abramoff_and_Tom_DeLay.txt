The Alexander Strategy Group (ASG), one of Washington's top lobbying operations, plans to shut down at the end of January. 

Edwin A. Buckham, the company's owner and former top DeLay aide, said Monday that the company had been fatally damaged by the publicity surrounding the federal investigation of the lobbyist Jack Abramoff and former House majority leader Tom DeLay (R-TX).

The company was founded in 1981 and has thrived due to its connections to Tom DeLay. Its current clients include Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, Microsoft, and the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America.

DeLay has been indicted for money laundering and other charges in Texas. ASG employed DeLay's wife, Christine, for four years.
