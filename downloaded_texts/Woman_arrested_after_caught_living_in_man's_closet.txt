In the town of Kasuya, Fukuoka, Japan, a 58-year-old woman was arrested after surveillance tape from inside an unnamed man's home showed her living in his closet.

According to police, Tatsuko Horikawa had been living in his closet for over one year. One day when the man left, she walked through his front door which had been left unlocked. From then on, she would take small amounts of food from the kitchen and even take showers. When the man noticed food missing, he set up cameras to catch what he thought was someone robbing him.

The woman had placed a small bed mattress into a enclosed shelf area inside the closet to sleep on and when police searched the apartment, they found her curled up in the closet.

"We searched the house ... checking everywhere someone could possibly hide. When we slid open the shelf closet, there she was, nervously curled up on her side," said Hiroki Itakura, a police spokesman.

The woman, who was described by police as "neat and clean", will be charged with trespassing.
