London, Englandâ€” With under forty-eight hours until the start of the 2012 Summer Paralympics, National Paralympic Committees are at different levels of preparedness in terms of sharing their message with the press.

One of the three teams with a presence in the Paralympics Media Press Centre (MPC), the Canadian Paralympic Committee, have prepared a media guide which is available online; unfortunately, they are still awaiting the arrival of paper copies from Canada.

Also based at the MPC, the US Paralympics delegation opted to go paperless. Instead, they made their media guide available online, with plans to release it on a USB flash drive at a later date.

The MPC-based Brazilian Paralympic Committee were the only National Committee on-site providing a paper media guide. Written only in Portuguese, they plan on publishing translated versions soon.

The Australian Paralympic Committee (APC) chose to be based off-site in the Novotel, Tower Bridge. According to APC representative Tony Naar, they have close relationships with all the media organizations who sent reporters to London, this justifying their decision to be located away from the Games site. The APC provides both an English-language paper media guide and an online one.

Team Great Britain and Papua New Guinea Paralympic Committee are also both located offsite, and both National Paralympic Committees have printed and online versions of their media guide.

The 2012 Summer Paralympics officially open this Wednesday.
