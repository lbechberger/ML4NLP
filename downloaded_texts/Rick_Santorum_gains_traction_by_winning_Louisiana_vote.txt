United States presidential hopeful Rick Santorum won yesterday evening's Louisiana Republican primary. This win gives Santorum more leverage over fellow presidental hopeful Mitt Romney. To date, Santorum has 263 delegates, following behind Romney's 563 delegates. 

Santorum has had success in the primaries in the South, winning primaries in Mississippi, Alabama, Tennessee, Oklahoma, and now Louisiana. Political analysts and the press speculated that he would take Louisiana based on the conservative and religious voter base. Participating voters were polled as believing that Santorum was more conservative and moral than Romney. 

The next primaries will be in Wisconsin, Washington, D.C., and Maryland on April 3.
