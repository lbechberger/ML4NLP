Italian rider Filippo Pozzato has won stage 5.

Fabian Cancellara of Switzerland kept the overall lead, again.

The 182.5 km fifth stage from Chablis to Autun featured eight climbs, including one Category 2 climb. Many of the sprinters lost contact with the peleton, but all of the major contenders finished together, apart from Alexandre Vinokourov. Vinokourov crashed before the final climb, and ended up losing more than a minute to the rest of the field. 

A tailbone injury may force Andreas Klöden, who is second in the overall standings, to withdraw from the Tour. Teammates Vinokourov and Klöden were both taken to the hospital.
