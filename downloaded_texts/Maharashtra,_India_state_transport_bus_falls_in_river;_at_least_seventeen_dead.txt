A state transport bus fell off a bridge on the river Purna killing at least seventeen people in Buldhana district of Maharashtra in central India. The Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) bus between Paturda and Shegaon fell after a burst tire caused the driver to lose control of the vehicle.

The bridge is narrow and without protective railings. The bus tumbled twice, falling 45 feet.

The bus contained about 50â€“70 passengers including school children in the morning bus. There were ten women and seven men amongst the fatalities. About twenty other passengers were rescued by the villagers from being drowned. The injured were transported to General Hospital, Akola. Two more are reported dead at the hospital, increasing the death toll to nineteen.

The MSRTC has announced it will pay the medical expenses of the injured and will also pay a compensation of INR 100,000 to the families of the deceased.
