Senator Rick Santorum wrote Monday that his "intention is not to run" in the GOP nomination for president. The two-term senator from Pennsylvania was among names mentioned as a contender to the White House in the next presidential election in 2008. 

Santorum faces a tough re-election challenge in his home state during the upcoming mid-term elections next year, where he is considered vulnerable against Democratic challenger and state treasurer Robert P. Casey Jr.

Santorum authored the book "It takes a Family: Conservatism and the Common Good" which further established views of him as a near ultra-conservative. 

On the WashingtonPost.com on-line discussion forum, the lawmaker said, "I have six children ages 4-14. And the idea of coming off a race of the intensity that I am engaged with at this point [in Pennsylavania] and turning around and running another two-year campaign for president is not something that I believe is in the best interest of my family."
