A man carrying a bag containing in what reports call hand , nails and "Islamic literature" was arrested outside the United States embassy in Vienna, Austria.

The unnamed Bosnian man, who is reported to be 42 years-old, tried to enter the embassy, triggering metal detector alarms. As a result, he placed the bag in front of the embassy and began to run from authorities.

"There were a lot of nails in that bag. Had it exploded, it would have had an enormous shrapnel effect," said a counter terrorism spokeswoman for Austria's government.

Subway trains and buses have been rerouted while officials use bomb-sniffing dogs to search the areas surrounding the embassy.

There are no reports of any injuries and authorities have "secured" the bag.
