Former Malaysian Prime Minister Dr. Mahathir Mohamad has said that he will not stop his criticism of the Malaysian government, even after "peace talks" were held yesterday between him and current Prime Minister Dr. Abdullah Badawi.

The 82-year old political veteran, who's now known for publicly regretting his handing of power to Dr. Badawi, said that the atmosphere during the dialogue was "cordial", but added that he was not entirely pleased with the results.
 


Political analysts have hailed the meeting as an opportunity for the two leaders to thrash out their differences in private, but some fear that their differences have already divided them beyond quick resolution.
