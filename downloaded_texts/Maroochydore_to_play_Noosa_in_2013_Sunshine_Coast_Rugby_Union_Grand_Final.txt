Sunshine Beach, Queensland &mdash; Maroochydore denied Caboolture a shot at back-to-back Sunshine Coast Rugby Union A-grade premierships today defeating them 24 points to 7 at Dolphin Oval, Sunshine Beach, Australia. Caboolture qualified for this match by beating Caloundra in the Minor Semi Final; Maroochydore lost the Major Semi Final against Noosa.



Maroochydore is now set to play Noosa in the A-grade grand final while, in the lower grades, Maleny had both of its teams move through to grand final day. Their reserve grade side defeated Maroochydore 53&ndash;24 and their under 19s beating Caboolture 29&ndash;20.

In the A-grade game, Maroochydore proved to dominate for Caboolture going 19&ndash;nil up at half time. They would have been a further two points up if not for a missed conversion.

The second half was more of an arm wrestle with both teams scoring tries. Maroochydore would cap off the win right on full time with an unsuccessful penalty. Unlike a week earlier, those in attendance were reasonably well behaved.

The Grand Final is scheduled to be held at Sunshine Coast Stadium in Bokarina, Queensland.
