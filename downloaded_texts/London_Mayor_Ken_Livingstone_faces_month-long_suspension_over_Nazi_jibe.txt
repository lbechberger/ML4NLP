The Adjudication Panel for England has ruled that London Mayor Ken Livingstone should be suspended from office for one month over an insult given to an Evening Standard reporter in which he likened the reporter to a concentration camp guard after being hassled by the reporter outside his home.

The suspension of an elected representative by an unelected panel over an issue in which a law was not broken is unprecedented. The Mayor's deputy, Nicky Gavron, has condemned the decision, as has the chairman of the Association of London Government Robin Wales.

Ken Livingstone will announce next week what his action will be. He may appeal to the High Court.
