Eight police officers have been injured and more than 32 people detained after protestors made an attempt to block the M9 road and railway lines. 

The violence occurred when residents of a camp site near Stirling in central Scotland began a mass movement towards the Gleneagles summit. A branch of Burger King in the Springkerse area of Stirling was also vandalised.

World leaders from the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Japan, Germany, France, Italy, and Russia are meeting in the 5 star Gleneagles hotel and golf course to discuss world issues. The presidents and prime ministers will debate, among other things, debt relief to Africa and climate change. 

More than 100 activists dressed in black, many hiding their faces with clothing, "streamed" from the temporary campsite early Wednesday morning, where close to 5,000 protestors are said to be staying. 

A camera man for the Associated Press Television said he saw a "group of around 100 smashing the windows of stationary cars and throwing stones at police." 

Bob Geldof, organiser of the Live 8 concerts and original Live Aid in 1985, has described the violent protestors as "idiots". Many have criticised Geldof's overexposure in the news, especially as apparent spokesman of the anti-G8 protests.
