Following a bill, which was passed with approximately 81% by the 207 MPs attending, Iran's parliament wants Iran to review its compliance with the International Atomic Energy Agency. This was the first time since the 1979 revolution that a bill was passed in five minutes. This bill was given double-urgency status, making it a higher priority over everything else. This passage occurs after the UN implemented sanctions against Iran for continuing its nuclear program; the new law permits for Iran to continue its program against the UN's wishes.

This new law allows President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to take action about the use of nuclear energy in Iran, including establishing conditions of inspections by the UN. However, the bill does not authorize the complete end of inspections.

The UN's atomic agency's governors may meet in January to consider imposing more sanctions if Iran does not end its nuclear program 60 days after the sanctions imposed on Saturday by the UN Security Council.

Iran is considering withdrawing from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.
