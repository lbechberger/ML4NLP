The San Francisco Giants defeated the Texas Rangers 3–1 on Monday night, winning the fifth game of the 2010 World Series and clinching the series title. It was the first World Series win for the Giants since 1954, and the first since the team's move from New York City to San Francisco.

The Giants had been ahead in the series three games to one coming into Monday's showdown at Rangers Ballpark. In front of a crowd of 52,045, Giants pitcher Tim Lincecum threw for eight innings, while series MVP and shortstop Edgar Rentería hit the game-winning three-run home run in the beginning of the inning. During the World Series, the Colombia native had a batting average of .412, a total of six runs batted in, and two home runs. Rentería also became the fourth player to hit the game-winning run in a World Series twice in a career.

The Rangers had never reached the World Series until 2010, but the team struggled. The Rangers had an overall batting average of .190 in the series and did not score for more than 18 consecutive innings before a lone home run in the seventh inning of Monday's game. Texas pitcher Cliff Lee prevented San Francisco from scoring for six innings before Rentería's seventh-inning hit.
