New Zealand Cricket is coming under increasing domestic pressure to reject a touring trip to Zimbabwe. The International Cricket Council (ICC), however, has demanded of the New Zealand Cricket team, called the 'Black Caps', to keep the scheduled play in Zimbabwe where there is to be five-week tour later this year.

New Zealand Prime Minister Helen Clark has condemned the tour stating, "Zimbabwe has just had a rigged election, which has produced a result which is simply unbelievable. I ... wouldn't go near it." But she refused to ban the tour, placing the onus instead on New Zealand Cricket.

The ICC may fine New Zealand up to US$2 million dollars for not attending the tour. England cricket, though, just bought its way out of playing two test matches at a cost of $400,000.

In 1981 there were nationwide protests during the South African Springbok rugby tour. Several games were cancelled due to the protests.
