Former Israeli prime minster Ariel Sharon, 78, has developed double pneumonia and is being treated with "massive" amounts of antibiotics according to hospital officials.

"We are talking about pneumonia that is being treated with massive antibiotics. There is no change in the functioning of the brain tissue and no significant fall in vital signs," said officials at Tel Hashomer hospital in the Sheba Medical Center located in Tel Aviv, in a statement today.

Yesterday doctors stated that Sharon's urine ouput had "decreased significantly" and that a scan of his brain "showed a deterioration in his brain function," said Anat Dolev, a Sheba Medical Center spokesman.

Yesterday the hospital reported that the condition of Sharon was getting worse.

Sharon has been in a coma since suffering a major stroke on January 4. Since being admitted to the hospital, he has undergone several rounds of surgery on his brain in an attempt to stop bleeding. Currently a respirator assists him in breathing.
