France has tightened its security, raising its security level to red, after the French government heard news of the London explosions on its transport network.

The French Prime Minister, Dominique de Villepin, convened the French ministers of defence, interior and foreign affairs to discuss the terrorist attacks. While giving no details, Villepin said that security was likely to be boosted on public transport and at important public buildings.

Expressing sympathy and solidarity for the terrorist attacks in London, Villepin said, "More than ever, democracies must rally together and show unity in the face of the terrorist threat. More than ever, we must show vigilance and determination."

President Jacques Chirac also gave his condolences to British Prime Minister Tony Blair, both of whom are currently attending the G8 summit in Scotland.

Chirac's spokesman said, "The president of the republic expressed to the British prime minister the horror caused by the tragic events in London and offered him sincere condolences."
