Chris Huhne, Liberal Democrat MP for Eastleigh, has resigned from his position as Energy Secretary in the cabinet of the UK's coalition government as he will face a prosecution for perverting the course of justice over a 2003 speeding incident.

In 2003, Huhne informed the police that his ex-wife, Vicky Pryce, had been driving his car and was responsible for a speeding ticket. Pryce accepted the speeding ticket and the penalty points for the offence were put on Pryce's driving license. The new charges contend Huhne was in fact the driver.

The Director of Public Prosecutions, Kier Starmer QC, gave a statement this morning announcing the prosecution of both Huhne and Pryce. Huhne has resigned and he will be replaced in the Cabinet by Ed Davey MP. Norman Lamb MP is expected to take the Business Minister job Davey is vacating. Huhne and Pryce are scheduled to appear at the Westminster Magistrates Court on February 16.

Huhne said the charges were "deeply regrettable" and vowed to contest them: "I am innocent of these charges and I intend to fight them in the courts and I am confident a jury will agree."
