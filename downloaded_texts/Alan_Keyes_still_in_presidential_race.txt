Alan Keyes wants everyone to know he still in the running for the Republican Party's nomination for the 2008 U.S. presidential election.

Saying that he thinks he still can win, the candidate's name has next to no recognition, a problem usually associated with independent or third party candidates. Keyes blames the media for his lack of recognition.

Keyes is centering his largely grassroots campaign in Texas, where he hopes to win the upcoming primary. At a recent campaign stop in Lubbock, Keyes asked voters to stick to their morals, vote for him, and let God perform a "miracle."

Dr. Keyes won no states on Super Tuesday, and as of this writing has zero delegates.

Keyes is the former Ambassador to the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations. Other major candidates registered for the Republican nomination are Mike Huckabee (former Governor of Arkansas), John McCain (U.S. Senator from Arizona), and Dr. Ron Paul (U.S. Representative from Texas and 1988 Libertarian Presidential nominee). Twenty-five others are also registered with the Federal Elections Commission (FEC).
