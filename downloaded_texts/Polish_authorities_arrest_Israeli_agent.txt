Polish authorities earlier this month arrested an alleged Israeli spy using the pseudonym Uri Brodsky, in connection with the murder of Mahmoud al-Mabhouh. 

After being arrested on a European arrest warrant on 4 June, Brodsky was ordered to remain in custody for forty days after being brought before the court on the sixth of this month. His extradition is being sought by Germany in connection to the forging of a German passport used in the assassination of Mahmoud al-Mabhouh.

Polish authorities have yet to decide to hand him over. Monika Lewandowska, the spokeswoman of Poland's prosecutors, added that nothing much was known about Brodsky except for his name. German newspaper Der Speigel has reported that the Israeli Embassy has urged Polish authorities against Brodsky's extradition.

Israel's Foreign Ministry spokesman, Andrew David, has said, "At the moment, we are looking into that like any other Israeli has been arrested, and he's getting consular treatment."

Dahi Khalfan Tamim, the Lieutenant-General of Dubai, has stated that he is nearly sure that Israel's spy agency, Mossad, is responsible for the January murder of al-Mabhouh, a senior Hamas official and co-founder of one of its military wings, in Dubai. Israel has disputed those claims, however, saying there is no proof of Israeli involvement in the incident.
