The International Olympic Committee (IOC) announced that biathlete Olga Pyleva, Russian Federation, has been excluded from the XX Olympic Winter Games after failing an anti-doping test carried out by the IOC. This is the first instance of an athlete being ejected from the 2006 Winter Olympics.
 
Pyleva, 30, tested positive for carphedon, a prohibited substance, on February 13 after the women's 15 km individual, biathlon event, in which she won the silver medal.

ITAR-TASS News Agency reports that Pyleva tested positive for cordedon, a stimulant banned by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA). The substitute, phenotropil, was prescribed by her doctors following an ankle injury according to Nikolai Durmanov, head of the Russian Anti Doping Committee.
 
The IOC determined that Pyleva would be disqualified from the 15km Womenâ€™s Individual Biathalon, would be excluded from the remainder of the XX Olympic Winter Games and would have her Olympic accreditation immediately withdrawn.

The IOC routinely performs pre and post event tests for a broad array of illegal substances. For each individual sport, the top five finishers plus two random finishers are tested. So far the IOC has conducted 400 of the expected 1,200 tests to be done at these games.

Under IOC rules, Olympians that test positive for a banned substance are considered guilty regardless of circumstances.

Martina Glagon of Germany, who finished with a Bronze medal, will be awarded the Silver. Albina Akhatova, Pyleva's Russian teammate will get the Bronze.
