Fatmir Sejdiu, the President of Kosovo, has resigned from his post. He resigned after a court ruled that he had breached the constitution by holding the post of president and being the leader of a political party at the same time. President Sejdiu is also the leader of the Democratic League of Kosovo (LDK).

Sejdiu announced his resignation during a press conference. He said "I presented my resignation for the post of Kosovo president today. I was convinced that keeping the function of the president of the Democratic League of Kosovo without exercising it did not violate the constitution, the court had a different opinion and I respect the ruling."

A complaint against Sejdiu had attracted the support of 32 members of parliament. Today the constitutional court of Kosovo ruled that Sejdiu breached the constitution by holding the posts of president of Kosovo and of the LDK.

Sejdiu became president in February 2006 after the death of Ibrahim Rugova and the nation declared independence from Serbia in 2008, subsequently becoming recognised by over 70 countries. At the time of his resignation Sejdiu was preparing for talks with Serbia over the possibility of joining the European Union.
