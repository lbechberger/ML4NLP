A man ripped off the head of a wax model of Adolf Hitler during the opening ceremony of a museum in Berlin, Germany.

An unknown 41-year old German, reported to be the second one in line at the opening of the Madame Tussauds museum in Berlin, pushed aside 2 officers then went to the exhibit depicting Hitler. He then yelled "No more war!" and ripped the wax head off only a few minutes after the museum opened.

Police arrested the man, charging him for assault and damaging property, said spokesman Uwe Kozelnik. The accused is currently in custody.

In the weeks preceding the opening, critics argued that it was inappropriate to show Hitler with other famous figures, while others say that Hitler's role in German history justifies his placement within the exhibition.
