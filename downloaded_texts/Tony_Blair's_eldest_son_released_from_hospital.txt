Euan Blair, the eldest son of British Prime Minister Tony Blair, has been released from hospital this evening. He was admitted yesterday after complaining of stomach pains. 

The twenty-two year-old was being treated in the Queen Elizabeth Hospital, near Bridgetown. It is not thought that Euan's condition was serious and he did not undergo surgery.

Tony Blair and his family had been holidaying on the Caribbean island for the past three weeks. Mr Blair returned home this morning and he was kept up to date with his son's condition.
