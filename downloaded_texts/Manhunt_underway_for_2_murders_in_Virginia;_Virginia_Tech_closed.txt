William Morva, who escaped from a hospital in Blacksburg on Sunday, is in custody. He is a suspect in the murders of hospital security guard, Derrick McFarland on Sunday, and police officer Cpl. Eric Sutphin.

Virginia Tech has closed their campus and cancelled classes on Monday. They issued an emergency advisory at 10:30 am local time. 

William Morva, 24, was taken to a hospital after complaining of a sprained wrist and leg, and escaped early Sunday morning after wounding a police officer and killing Derrick McFarland, an unarmed security guard. Around 7:30 am, Morva shot and fatally wounded Cpl. Eric Sutphin while he was on patrol on a local trail. Virginia Tech cancelled classes after a report that Morva was seen in a campus building. The building was evacuated, but he was not found.
