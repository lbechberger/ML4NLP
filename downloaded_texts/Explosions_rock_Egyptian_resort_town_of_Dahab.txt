Three explosions rocked the Egyptian resort city of Dahab and killed at least 24 people. Between 60 and 150 people were injured in the attack.

The blasts came at the height of the tourist season, officials said. The three time bombs exploded in a busy restaurant and in a market area in the Red Sea resort city within a span of five minutes.

Dahab is located on the Gulf of Aqaba on the eastern side of the Sinai Peninsula.
