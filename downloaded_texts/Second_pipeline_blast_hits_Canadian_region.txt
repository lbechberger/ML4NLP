Today in Dawson Creek, Canada, at 9:15 a.m. local time, police reported that two gas pipeline bombs have now hit the area. 

As a result of these incidents, local residents are now concerned for their safety. The two explosions were targeting gas pipelines operated by EnCana near the British Columbia – Alberta border. 

The most recent blast was discovered yesterday, and the reports show that terrorists weren’t involved in this incident. 

Despite this, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) have stated that they have brought in their terrorism unit to help investigate the incident, as the bombs targeted the province’s infrastructure. 

The latest explosion site was discovered on Thursday by the pipeline workers, and the fact that the explosion resembles another pipeline blast in the area earlier this month which has caused the residents to be worried. The explosion damaged the pipeline, but it was quickly sealed by the workers as reported by the officials.

Investigators are looking to find a link between these two explosions, and have asked the residents not to panic.
