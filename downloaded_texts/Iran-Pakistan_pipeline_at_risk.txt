The Iran-Pakistan gas pipeline project is at risk of cancellation as negotiations between the government of Iran and the Pakistani government remain unresolved. The Iranian Oil Minister, Bijan Namdar Zangenah, doubts its future.

"The contract for supplying gas to Pakistan is likely to be annulled," Zangenah said in a press release on Wednesday.

Reasons include the lack of support from the United States government. The cost of sanctions on Iran and minimal funds are also causing concern. The Pakistani government is trying to resolve the issue with Iran and the United States to reach a peaceful solution. 

Senator Pervaiz Rashid, Federal Minister for Information and Broadcasting, said the project is intact, and Pakistani government is working closely with the Iranian Government to start working on the project.
