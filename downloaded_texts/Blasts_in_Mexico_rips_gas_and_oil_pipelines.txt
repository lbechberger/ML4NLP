Oil and gas pipelines in Mexico were attacked in six different places Monday, forcing the evacuation of approximately 12,000 residents. The six blasts were to reported to have happened at about 2:00 a.m on Monday morning. 

The company who owns the pipelines, Petroleos Mexicanos, shut down all lines after the attack. 

No deaths as a result of the explosions were reported, however; the blasts were blamed for the death of two 70 year old women who died from heart attacks. 

Mexican officials have called the blasts "premeditated" and at least one rebel group (most notably EPR) has claimed responsibility for the blasts.
