US Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Director Michael Brown has been recalled to Washington after criticism of his role in managing the Hurricane Katrina crisis. US Coast Guard Vice Admiral Thad W. Allen replaces him as the direct head of operations. 

Questions are being raised over Brown's background and his claims of previous experience in disaster management. US Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security Michael Chertoff is to hold a press conference in Baton Rouge at 13:45 EDT, where it is expected that an announcement will be made over Brown's future role.
