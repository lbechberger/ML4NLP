Felipe Massa, driving for Ferrari, won the 2007 FIA Formula One Gulf Air Bahrain Grand prix at Bahrain International Circuit, Sakhir, Bahrain. Starting from pole, the Brazilian controlled the whole race losing the lead only due to pit-stops.

Closely competing with him, young McLaren-Mercedes driver Lewis Hamilton crossed the finish line on the second place marking his third consecutive podium in this Formula-1 season. Kimi Raikkonen, equipped with a significantly greater fuel load, wasted time trying to drive closer to Hamilton and finished third.

Hamilton's teammate Fernando Alonso was unable to keep Nick Heidfeld from BMW-Sauber off his back, who passed last year's champion easily in one overtaking attempt.

For the FIA Formula One championship, the lead is now tied among Alonso, Raikkonen and Hamilton, who all have 22 points. With his win, Massa jumped to within striking distance at 17 points, closely followed by Heidfeld with 15. In sixth place in points is Fisichella with a tally of eight.
