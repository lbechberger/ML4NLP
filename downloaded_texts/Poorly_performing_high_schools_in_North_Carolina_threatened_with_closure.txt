In March, Wake County Superior Court Judge Howard Manning threatened to close state high schools that did not meet his expectations. High schools had to meet a passing grade of 55 percent or face large scale reform.

On August 18 Judge Manning will review the state's plan to help the schools that did not meet his goal.

Last month, Governor Easely unveiled a strategy for the low performing schools. Plans include leadership training for administrators and blueprints for improvement.

Several of the failing schools saw a reduction in passing grades over the past year. Durham County's Southern High School fell from 54.1 percent of students passing to 45.6 percent.

Superintendent of Public Instruction June Atkinson said, "I was optimistic that we would see more improvement, but it takes more time to turn around a school than just a year."
