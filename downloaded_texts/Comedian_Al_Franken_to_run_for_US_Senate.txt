Al Franken, a comedian, is going to run for Senator in 2008 for the state of Minnesota according to an unnamed official currently serving in the state, media reports say.

According to the unnamed official, Franken said that he is planning to run for the senate in 2008 during a conversation.

The director of Franken's Midwest Values Political Action Committee has refused to comment on the reports, and Franken has made no official announcement himself.

Earlier this week, Franken announced on his Air America Radio show that he will no longer be hosting the show, but also said that he would make a decision about the senate race in the near future.
