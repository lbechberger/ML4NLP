Police in Napier, New Zealand were amused when a 45-year-old woman called to report the theft of her " carefully nurturedâ€� cannabis plants, that she had been growing in buckets at her home.

The crying woman told a constable the plant theft was the fourth from her property in four years.
 
"I have had three marijuana plants stolen. They were in buckets," a police communications officer was told, "I am a good person. I am sick of these low-lifes stealing my things."

Senior Sergeant Mal Lochrie said that the officer found it hard to stop smiling as the woman gave details of the theft over the phone.

The woman has now been warned that her cannabis plantation could have legal consequences. However, Snr. Sgt. Lochrie said no legal action would be taken against her.
