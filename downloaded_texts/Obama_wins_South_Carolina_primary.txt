Barack Obama has won the South Carolina Democratic primary, with 55 percent of the vote.

Hillary Clinton came in second with 27 percent of the vote, while John Edwards was third with 18 percent.

"Tonight, the cynics who believed that what began in the snows of Iowa was just an illusion were told a different story by the good people of South Carolina," Obama told his supporters. 

"In nine short days, nearly half the nation will have the chance to join us in saying that we are tired of business-as-usual in Washington, we are hungry for change, and we are ready to believe again," he said, referring to Super Tuesday, which will be on February 5. 24 states will be holding primaries or caucuses on that day.

Clinton reportedly called Obama to congratulate him on his victory.

"I have called Senator Obama to congratulate him and wish him well," she stated.

A CNN exit poll showed Obama with 81 percent of the black vote, in a primary where 55 percent of voters were black. The exit poll also showed Obama with 24 percent of the white vote, while Edwards and Clinton received 39 percent and 36 percent of this demographic, respectively.
