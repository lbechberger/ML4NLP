Swedish director Ingmar Bergman, a filmmaker widely regarded as one of the great masters of modern cinema, died today at his home on Fårö, Gotland, Sweden. He was 89. The exact cause of death is not known.

"It's an unbelievable loss for Sweden, but even more so internationally," Astrid Söderbergh Widding, president of The Ingmar Bergman Foundation, told Associated Press.

"This is an enormous loss, not only for artistic Sweden but because he was one of the most well-known Swedes in the world," Jon Asp, a spokesperson for the Ingmar Bergman Foundation, said in a telephone interview with Bloomberg. "Had it not been for his struggles in the 40s and 50s, Swedish directors such as Jan Troell and Bo Widerberg may not have been able to make films."

"He was one of the world's biggest personalities. There were Kurosawa, Fellini and then Bergman. Now he is also gone," Danish director Bille August said to Associated Press. "It is a great loss. I am in shock."

Hungarian director István Szabó told MTI: "The Bergman films are to viewers like the novels of a great novelist, the poems of a great poet or the works of a great drama writer ... He valued contact with the audience very much and the story which can be told to them, while he did not attribute a great value to stories which can only be understood by snobs and highly qualified aesthetes."
