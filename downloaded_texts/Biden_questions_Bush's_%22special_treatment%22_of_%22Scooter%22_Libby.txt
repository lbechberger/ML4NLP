Yesterday Wikinews reported that the prison sentence of I. Lewis 'Scooter' Libby was commuted by US President George W. Bush. Today Senator Joe Biden of Delaware, a Democratic Party hopeful for the 2008 Presidential election, has issued a statement on his blog critical of the President's actions.




Libby is the former chief of staff for U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney, and was at the center of the CIA leak scandal, where the identity of former CIA agent Valerie Plame was allegedly leaked to the media by White House officials. Bush's intervention ensures that Libby will not serve jail time, however Libby must still pay a US$250,000 fine and undergo two years of probation.

Biden goes on to suggest that "George Bush's disregard for the rule of law is truly unbecoming a President. In 2000, when you ran for president, you promised to 'uphold the honor and dignity' of the office of President of the United Statesâ€”we're still waiting."
